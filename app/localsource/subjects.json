She is the Director of the Baum Forum, a program that includes conferences and seminars focusing on food and agricultural issues, and the President of Public Market Partners.\r\n\r\nBaum is also the co-founder, with Fern Gail Estrow, of Food Systems Network NYC, a collaborative that brings together representatives from food-related non-profits, government agencies, and private citizens interested in the worlds of: food safety and food justice; farmers\u0027 markets; public markets; agricultural marketing programs; and community supported agriculture.\r\n\r\nHer childhood and early life, however, took place in a more rarified corner of the New York food world. Her father, the prescient Joe Baum, was the force behind The Four Seasons, Windows on the World, and The Rainbow Room\u00e2\u20ac\u201dplaces that redefined what restaurants and the restaurant experience could be. Through her parents, she met legendary figures in that world like James Beard, a family friend.",

      "bio": "In 1976, the post-World War II habits of supermarket shopping still ruled American kitchens. Fresh fruits and vegetables were limited to summertime roadside stands. To most urban dwellers, farmers were distant exotic creatures. It would be decades before words like local, seasonal, and organic became commonplace.\r\n\r\nBrought to life by Architect Barry Benepe and urban planner Robert Lewis, the Greemarket movement was a major development that helped to change that way of thinking. This movement initiated consumer appreciation\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand eventually demand for\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfresh food.\r\n\r\nAt the time, Benepe was the director of his own small firm and therefore not bound by traditional notions of architectural practice, allowing him to expand into unorthodox areas such as open space protection and farmland preservation. Lewis applied for a job at his firm. Together they saw the disconnect between the food to which New Yorkers had access in standard supermarkets, and the much fresher, higher quality food produced by area farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the possibility of bringing the two together. When they located an unused and vacant city lot behind Bloomingdales on Manhattan\u0027s Upper East Side, they jumpstarted the New York City Greenmarket movement.",

      "bio": "The distinguished historian Betty Fussell was one of the first American writers to focus on food as a legitimate subject of scientific, social, and anthropological inquiry.\r\n\r\nIn her 1999, The Story of Corn: the Myths and History, the Culture and Agriculture, the Art and Science of America\u0027s Quintessential Crop, Fussel used the history of corn to tell a distinctly American story. She also created a genre, now much imitated by other writers, focused on a single foodstuff.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1927 in California and reared there, she has made her home in New York\u0027s Greenwich Village for decades. She lives around the corner from James Beard\u0027s cooking school run out of his home. Her only contact was a week\u0027s worth of classes there, but they share an abiding passion for American food.\r\n\r\nHer essays in literary journals, major newspapers, national magazines and encyclopedias are written with a grace few food writers can match. She also lectures at museums, universities, state fairs, corn festivals, historical societies and culinary groups. In 1999, her food memoir, My Kitchen Wars, traced her life from her childhoood through her marriage to a college sweetheart, her travails as an academic wife, her own academic career, the women\u0027s movement, and her wider success when she found her essential subject: food.

It was common knowledge that food companies often sent Beard samples of their products in the hope that he would try them, like them, and, with luck, promote them in his columns. Greene figured Beard might have some actual food to contribute on a more-or-less regular basis.\r\n\r\nJumping into action, she phoned him to enlist his support, and encouraged him to join her effort to remedy the situation. The result was CityMeals On Wheels, where he lent his name and enthusiasm to a project that still exists today.\r\n\r\nGreene left New York Magazine in 2008 and today has become an active free-lance writer, blogger, and tweeter.",

His teachers were his on-the-jobs training, the chefs he worked for there and in New York and books, especially Jacques Pepin\u0027s on method and technique.\r\n\r\nHe came to wide attention at the Gramercy Tavern in New York\u0027s Flatiron district, and then at Craft nearby.\r\n\r\nThe recipient of five James Beard Foundation awards, today Colichio and his cooking can be seen not only at the Craft restaurants (including Craftbar and Craftsteak) in New York, LA, Dallas, and Las Vegas), but also at Colicchio and Sons in Manhattan\u0027s Meatpacking District. In 2003, Colicchio and two partners founded the more affordable sandwich and salad outlets, \u0027wichcraft.

Massive and abstruse pieces of federal legislation that are reworked every five years or so, the farm bills are little understood but enormously influential on food and farm related subjects from food stamps to commodity crops to conservation and trade.\r\n\r\nActivist speaker, writer and publisher Dan Imhoff illuminated that world for the lay public (and perhaps also for members of Congress) in his 2007 book, Food Fight: The Citizen\u0027s Guide to a Food and Farm Bill.\r\n\r\nThis Interview tracks over Imhoff\u0027s childhood in York PA, his education, his travels in Asia and Europe after college, some of important influences in his thinking about the environment (including a businessman who later became his father-in-law), his interest in a variety of environmental issues, and his life in Northern California, where he and his wife have a small farm that provides much of the food for their family.\r\n\r\nWith the recent publication of CAFO: The Tragedy of Industrial Animal Factories, Imhoff took on the increasingly contentious world of American meat production. He is currently at work on a revised edition of Food Fight.",
