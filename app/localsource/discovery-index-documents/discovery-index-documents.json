TTT\n\nInterviewee:  Dan Barber\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t           New York City\n\nDate:  February 15, 2011\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is February 15, 2011, and I’m with Dan Barber at Blue Hill Restaurant in Greenwich Village in New York.\nGood afternoon.\n\nBarber:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we start with your telling me something about your background, your family background, where you grew up, what kind of education you had, and, for that matter, the food that you grew up with.\n\nBarber:  I grew up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan on 96th Street.  I was born and raised there.  My mother died at a very early age.  She died when I was four, and so my experience with home-cooked meals was—I don’t know.  What was it?  It was a little bit all over the map.  My father was very interested in food, so we often went out for dinner, which is probably where I got a sense of different cuisines and fine food.  He was in sort of international business and it was always requiring that he travel, and I often traveled with him, then also eating.  He had a great love of food and very interested in other cultures, so that inculcated, I think, a sense of fine dining.\n\nQ:  Did you have siblings?\n\nBarber:  Yes.  My brother, who’s my business partner here at Blue Hill, and my sister, who is a bit older; she’s from my mother’s previous marriage.  So, yes.  For a time we all lived together.  When my mother passed away, my sister went off to college.\n\tAnyway, I went to Dalton on the Upper East Side.  Like I said, my interest in food was really my father’s interest, and I was excited by good food because he was excited by good food, I think.  Most of my childhood was spent at Blue Hill Farm, which is in the Berkshires, where I spent the summers and other time away from school.  My grandmother’s farm that she started in Great Barrington in the Berkshires in the late sixties, called Blue Hill Farm, that is where I took care with the farmers of haying the fields and moving cattle and the sort of general upkeep of about two hundred acres of pastureland.\n\nQ:  What kind of farm was it?\n\nBarber:  Like I said, it raised beef cattle that would then be shipped off to be finished, but it was essentially a grass-based operation.  It had originally been a dairy built in the early 1900s, late 1800s, and was in the family for, I think, two generations or maybe even more.  That was a dairy that went out of business.  My grandmother bought the farm.  She turned it into just pasture and cattle.\nThen when my grandmother died, we didn’t do anything to the farm until recently.  The last ten years, we introduced dairy.  So we’re milking twenty head of cattle and we raise goats and pigs and chickens now.  So we’ve turned it into a real working farm, which is fantastic, and the restaurant buys from Blue Hill Farm as well.\n\nQ:  Was your father interested in that at all?\n\nBarber:  My father wasn’t, no, but he was very encouraging.  I was very interested in it because I really loved the farmers and I loved the chores for the day and I loved the kind of monotony of the work, driving the tractors for endless hours.  I found the whole experience really sort of exhilarating and I was very drawn to it, and I liked the hard work.  I liked the physically exhausting work.  We were basically haying the fields and storing the hay for the summer.  That was basically what we did, lifting a lot of bales of hay.  Back then it was square bales of hay.  It feels sort of ancient, but that’s what it was.\n\nQ:  And this you did on your school vacations?\n\nBarber:  Yes.  It was essentially like half of July and August that the farm was really going in that sense.  There was a lot of open pastureland that stored a lot of hay for the cattle, and then there was a lot of movement of the cattle.  We had a bull, so there was caring for the bull and whatnot.  So that’s how the farm worked.  It was a very simple operation, but for a kid who at my age was so struck by everything, it was so different from my normal life, and I was drawn to it also because my grandmother was there.  So I was very drawn to my grandmother, and obviously, without a mother, it was important.  So I did a lot of chores around the farm, gardening, weeding, essentially.  I didn’t garden, but I essentially just weeded.\n\nQ:  This was your mother’s mother or your father’s mother?\n\nBarber:  My mother’s mother.  I think maybe the happiest days were filled with this exhausting and exhaustive look at farm life, so probably informed the kind of chef that I later became.\n\nQ:  What was the difference between the food that you would eat in the city and the food that you would eat there?\n\nBarber:  My grandmother was a gourmet, but not a cook.  She didn’t cook at all, in fact.  She was a very glamorous, beautiful woman who was an actress, and then after a divorce from my grandfather, ended up dating some very prominent men.  She dated for a long time the ambassador to India.  She was just introduced to cultures and to food constantly, and she had an incredible palate, but yet no cooking.  I don’t really remember.  There was always food around and it was always of good quality, but I wouldn’t say that she was a fanatic about the garden, even though we had a garden and a good one, a big one.  Her interest in the farm and in the gardening and in the place, Blue Hill Farm, was much more out of an aesthetic sense of open space and of beauty.  She was very much a social conduit for the Berkshires at the time.  She was the chairman of the Berkshire Theater Festival and she was on the board of Riggs, the psychiatric institute.  She was involved in all sorts of arts, fundraising.  So she had people over to the house on occasion or often.  So her “in” to this whole interest of farming was to have a place that people could have cocktails, overlook cattle grazing on the grass.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Not bad.\n\nBarber:  Right.  I mean, it’s so interesting.  It always struck me.  People often think of our grandmother as somebody who gave us this sense of the connection to land and food, and I don’t think that’s so true, although she did in a way that is a little unusual, but no less effective.  She kept the property open and vibrant and passed it on to us.  So in that sense, very successful and, I think, rather interesting.\n\nQ:  What was food like here in the city?\n\nBarber:  We had somebody who cooked meals for us a couple days a week, and then I often did a little bit of cooking, just informal stuff like grilled cheese sandwiches and things.  So it didn’t feel like, let’s say, a less rich existence until I really became conscious of my friends who had mothers who were very doting and food for everyone was a central part of the family experience.  For us it was, just in a very different way, so I could relate to it in some ways and in other ways I felt, I think, probably very jealous.  I ended up being drawn to food in a way, I was sort of overcompensating for not having a mother.  I don’t want to get too analytical about it.  I’m still trying to figure it out, but it is interesting the direction of this company or my life.  Its sort of keystone is in the farm and in my feelings towards food.  I guess it’s true for everyone, but it played out in such an interesting way, I think.\n\nQ:  What was the food at Dalton like?\n\nBarber:  Not very good.  I don’t remember any of the private school lunches being anything of what they are today.  I was just at Dalton the other day.  I did this panel with Eric Schlosser, the great food writer.  We went up to the lunch cafeteria, just amazing what they’re doing, local food in the cafeteria.  I mean, it’s very impressive.\n\nQ:  That is amazing.  For that matter, you and Eric Schlosser at Dalton is pretty amazing too.  [laughs]\n\nBarber:  Well, Eric, it was a real pleasure to like—I was thinking of all the people, like he really—it’s hard to pinpoint who is the most influential in this movement, and you can go back to a million people, Wendell Berry.  You can go back to so many people.  But he was a catalyst for me.  He was a huge catalyst, because he told a story that was very compelling and he really gave me a lot of confidence to pursue the direction I was interested in pursuing.\n\tNow it seems so obvious and un-risky, but back when we opened where we’re sitting, Blue Hill Restaurant in New York, which was now eleven years ago, it was a very risky—it didn’t capture the zeitgeist to talk about locality of food.  People were talking about organic food a bit.  Again, I don’t think this restaurant represents anything so radical that these ideas that we talk about every day and the meeting we’re about to have with the waiters—we talk about the ideas of what we’re doing every day—I don’t think anything is sort of new, but to have them be expressed through fine dining and through a restaurant felt a little frightening.\n\nQ:  Eleven years ago.  That’s interesting.\n\nBarber:  Yes.  I mean, there’s a lot’s happened in eleven years.  This was pre-[Michael] Pollan, for the most part, and it was really Eric, who wrote this book Fast Food Nation, that ended up telling just a great story and had a curiosity about where does our food come from and who’s growing it and who’s raising it and how’s it getting to us.  They’re all questions that were put through the prism of a hamburger.  It was great, really brilliant.  And something that I learned on the stage with him at Dalton, that he was really warned against doing it.  There were so many people telling him this wouldn’t sell and so many people telling him—it’s very, very—anyway, for me, I read that and just felt like this is what I want to focus on, because I think I had some reservations about being a chef.  I know I did.\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nBarber:  I still do.  Well, just the life.  I knew enough.  I’d been a line cook for long enough to know that the life was very hard and very debilitating physically and incredibly difficult to have a family, and all those things that were very obvious, although I continued to do it.  I was always trying to figure out how do you stay in this business and be happy.\n\nQ:  Take me through your schooling.\n\nBarber:  Yes, I’m kind of fast-forwarding, sorry.  My schooling.  Well, so Dalton.  I went to Tufts University, and I was a political science and English major.\n\tI started this catering company in college with a friend, just, again, for earning a little bit of extra money.  He had an interest in food, and we used to sort of read recipes and, like, get excited about what chefs were doing in Boston.  So we started this little catering gig, and people used to come over.  We’d pass around a black hat, and everyone would donate, and we’d cook this big party of food.  It was really fun.\n\nQ:  That was a little unusual, wasn’t it?  I mean, at that point, obviously, you could cook, sort of.\n\nBarber:  I don’t know.  [laughter]  Let’s just say I pretended really well.  It was a good sort of social gathering.  I guess it was unusual.  It was very different than a frat party, although by the end it had grown very popular and I think the last ones we gave in senior year were really well attended and became something of a—\n\nQ:  Do you remember thinking it up?\n\nBarber:  Yes.  Yes, I do.\n\nQ:  What was the idea?\n\nBarber:  The idea was to have a party but do it in a way that interested us.  My friend Gene Choi is actually in the restaurant business now, and I’m still quite close with.  Yes, it was probably to get girls too.  I don’t know.  There were probably a lot of different motivations.  One of them was to make a little bit of money, although I don’t think we ended—we bought the best ingredients of everything we could find, and I’m sure we lost a ton of money.  We never really counted.\n\tAnyway, so that was one of the more enjoyable parts of Tufts that I remember.  But any rate, so I graduated, and I had the opportunity to—I applied for a Fulbright scholarship, which I was informed that I had received, and then they canceled the program about a month before I was going.  So I ended up not knowing what to do, and my friend Gene, who I’d done this catering thing with, was driving across country to cook in San Francisco, and I thought, “I’ll do the same.”  But I didn’t want to go to San Francisco.  I very much wanted to go to L.A., because I wanted to bake bread.  I’d cooked a little bit and I just felt like I didn’t know that was the thing I wanted to do, but I felt like maybe I wanted to write.\n\tI didn’t exactly know what I wanted to do, but bread always really appealed to me.  I knew nothing about—I was no good at making bread, baking bread.  So I had heard about this woman, Nancy Silverton, who is La Brea Bakery in L.A., and all of a sudden—I spent a couple of months in San Francisco, and we continued to cook, Choi and I.  We had these like dinner parties and stuff.  But I just woke up one morning and I don’t know, I just drove to L.A. and walked into La Brea Bakery, and I got this, like, externship and worked for free for a while and baked at night and tried to write during the day.\n\tThen I ended up having to cook at the restaurant during the day for, like, the breakfast-lunch shift, because I didn’t have any money and, like, I was earning money, so it was a crazy schedule.  I’d just bake all night and then I’d drive from there to do the breakfast and then I’d go home and sort of sleep during the day.  It was literally awful.\n\nQ:  This sounds, to today’s ears, normal.\n\nBarber:  Right.\n\nQ:  But it wasn’t, was it?\n\nBarber:  No, no, right.  Is it normal today, like college grads sort of pursuing what they want?  Yes, no, I mean, for sure.  You know, my father, who I’ve always said when I told him that I thought maybe I wanted to cook, he said, “I love to read, but I don’t do it for a living.”  Right?  So, like, there was that part of him that was sort of very skeptical, and then there was another part of him that was very encouraging, and that was most of it, very encouraging and gave me the money to get out there and basically said, “These are the years to experience something different from what you end up doing.”  Little did he know that I would end up doing it.  [laughs]  But he’s very liberal minded to take that viewpoint, and it’s true those are precious years, as everyone knows now, and I think they knew it then.  I just don’t think it was conventional to do something about it.\n\nQ:  Definitely not.  And your brother?\n\nBarber:  My brother was in New York working.  He’s a few years older than I am.  I don’t remember what he did exactly after college, but—\n\nQ:  But in any case, you weren’t together.\n\nBarber:  No, no, no, no, no, not at all, no.  He wasn’t even in the restaurant business at all.  He was in the advertising business.\n\tThen I spent about a year and a half in L.A., and I really didn’t like baking bread at night.  I ended up cooking in a few restaurants.  So I wouldn’t say that I was convinced that, like, I wanted to be a chef, because I was probably getting more convinced that I didn’t want to a chef, which was my original inclination, but I didn’t know where this was going to go.\n\tThen I got very sick.  I got cancer.  That was in L.A. in the middle of all this, of cooking and baking bread.  So I ended up having to come back to New York.  Then I was in Indiana for a while, sort of back and forth, because this doctor who was sort of the leading doctor with this—I had a rare form of testes cancer, and so I ended up having to get treated out there.  I went out.  So this took a while, and then from that experience I was back out in California for a little while, but then in the East Coast cooking, and then I decided to go to France.\n\tSo if there’s, like, a threading theme through all of this, it’s, like, it’s just unknown.  It’s like I don’t exactly know why I kept with cooking.  I knew it wasn’t making me very happy.  I wasn’t particularly good at it, by the way, to make a judgment.  I mean, I became a very good line cook, I think, by the end, but I wasn’t like a natural.  I was quite—and I was very athletic.\n\nQ:  So physically demanding too.\n\nBarber:  Well, yes, yes.  But I mean, I was young, and I was very strong.  I was in very good shape.  I was an athlete in college, and I’m a good athlete just in general, or I was.  Who I look for now in my kitchen are athletic people, I mean, for sure, because those end up making very, very good—but I just did not enjoy it, I think, and I didn’t have the patience for doing kind of meticulous work.  So I did not excel in the places that I worked.\n\tI went to France because my aunt and uncle, who were a big influence on my life—now, this is my mother’s brother and his wife were enormous foodies and were always introducing me to French food.  They often lived in France.  My uncle took sabbaticals in France.  He’s a doctor, a research doctor, and took these sabbaticals.  We would visit him, and I got interested I think in French food in particular because of him and because of her, big influences on my life and very outside sort of personalities and very passionate about food and wine.\n\nQ:  When they were in France, where did they live?\n\nBarber:  Well, they moved each time to a different beautiful, small, just very, very lovely apartment, and they ended up on the Île Saint-Louis, which is where—\n\nQ:  Not bad.\n\nBarber:  Right, right.  That was the nicest apartment, which they still have, and that’s where I went to—I didn’t end up staying there, but I spent a lot of time there when I worked in Paris, and I spent a year or so more in Paris.  Actually, I spent about half a year in Paris and I spent a lot of time traveling in the south.  That’s really, I think, where things started to click, and I became a much better cook.  I got introduced to a lot of interesting chefs.  One in Paris I began working with and stayed for a while, Michel Rostang, is who back then was a two-Michelin-star chef and still is today, but was one of the leading chefs of the time.  It was a really impressive restaurant, and so I worked there for a while.\n\nQ:  By then you were about how old?\n\nBarber:  I was twenty-five or twenty-six.\n\nQ:  When you went to France?\n\nBarber:  Yes, twenty-five, I think.\n\nQ:  Were you worried about what you were going to do with your life?\n\nBarber:  Yes, always, always.  This was not a calling.  I don’t know what I was doing.  I kept thinking like—I was so sure that, like, with each restaurant that I went into, I didn’t want this as my life and I didn’t picture it.  I was assured of that.\n\tSo it ended up being very tough in France.  Today there’s these hour restrictions.  There’s a thirty-five-hour work week in France now.  That is the law, and back then there was no such law.  You worked impossible hours.\n\nQ:  I didn’t realize it extended into kitchens now as well, that they police that.\n\nBarber:  Yes.  Well, it’s what’s killing French food, because there’s no time to do anything, and no restaurant can afford to double up even more.  I mean, where I worked with Michel Rostang, there were more cooks than there were diners.  I mean, the food was so elaborate.  And that’s why I think France was the place to be at the time.  Spain probably is now, or I don’t know, Japan.  I don’t know where is now, but back then it was probably France, and today it might be Italy, Spain, or Japan.\n\tAnyway, yes, so I was so traumatized by some of the experiences there.  Maybe one day I can write about them too.  Very brutal chefs.  Yes, you’ve heard all the stories.  It’s probably why I don’t write about it, because everyone’s heard.  It’s been told before, and I don’t know that I have anything fresh to say except it was humiliating and exhausting and belittling and all the rest.\n\nQ:  I think somebody with your kind of education, it probably was really shocking to encounter something like that.\n\nBarber:  Yes.  Although I have to say, like, it’s interesting you say that.  It’s something to really think about.  I think at that point I was cooking long enough that I knew kind of what a kitchen was like.  But here were these cooks, these French—everyone was French, and they’re all so cerebral.  I mean, it was like one of those things, I guess it’s that way now, it’s they decide what you do with your life when you’re twelve years old.  You either become a doctor or you clean toilets.  It’s just the craziest system, and there are these amazingly interesting, thoughtful, highly intellectual cooks.  It’s very different from what you see in America or anywhere else.  But still, it was an atmosphere that was just very rough and very uncomfortable.  I don’t know.\nSo I came back here.  So what did I do?  I thought maybe a catering business was the thing to do, because then you could control your hours.  That’s what I was thinking, control my hours.  I could take parties that I wanted to take, and I had good connections with friends and family and all that stuff.\n\tSo I worked for [David] Bouley when I got back for a while, until the restaurant closed, and that was also a really interesting experience.\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nBarber:  Well, it was a sort of chaos that I hadn’t experienced in any kitchen.  We were doing food that one would associate with the finest restaurants in Paris, but instead of doing forty or fifty covers, fifty diners a night, we were doing two hundred fifty and three hundred diners.  A madhouse, but it could be done.  I think Bouley and Jean Georges, all of these chefs of that era, Wolfgang Puck, but really Bouley was the one who took the model of France, because he worked all over France, and brought it here and showed that you could do very fine food with a large amount of covers.  He was one of the first.  I don’t think he gets enough credit for that.\n\nQ:  Was that, at that point, quite unusual?\n\nBarber:  I don’t think people even understood it, because you have to have a restaurant mind to see it.  It didn’t look like a crowded place.  But you didn’t have a table for the night; you had seatings.  In France, you have your table for the night, as you know.  But that concept was so—it fit with the New York lifestyle; nobody sits there.  But it was really Bouley’s interpretation of, like, “We’re going to make money doing this, but we’re not going to sacrifice food.”  And so you cooked everything to order.  I mean, I don’t want to exaggerate too much, because there were other restaurants who were fish to order.  I mean, not everyone precooked fish.  But a lot did; most did, even the finer restaurants.  And nobody did the covers he did.  It was unbelievable, and the number of courses in a meal, it’s just staggering.  So that was a big influence for me.  Not that I opened up a restaurant similar to his, but just that it was very inspiring to be in an environment where you can see a whole culture rewritten.\n\nQ:  So just to be clear—that’s what I was going to ask you—could you see it was being rewritten, or did it seem more like the restaurants in France?\n\nBarber:  No, no.  It was very frightening.  I was coming from the great restaurants, and I had a chip on my shoulder.  I thought by this point I was very good.\n\nQ:  Very frightening because of the speed and the number?\n\nBarber:  Yes, just the confusion and the tickets called out.  I mean, it was just mind-numbing.  Like the Saturday night there, it was like a tidal wave of tickets and people.\n\nQ:  So how many covers might they have had?\n\nBarber:  Yes, two-fifty.  See, you’re doing in that place, 80 percent of the orders were tasting menus, so those six courses.  So you have, let’s say, two hundred people ordering six courses.  You’ve got twelve hundred plates plus the other, so you’ve got like eighteen hundred plates going in and out of the kitchen.  There weren’t that many cooks.  There were a lot, but there was Bouley, plating everything, which is also another thing.  In France, the chefs didn’t cook, not like that.  It was extraordinary to watch.  And I didn’t know, but he was closing.  I didn’t know it at the time.\n\tSo I think that had a big influence on—again, how big of an influence could it have had, because I didn’t open up a restaurant like it, but it was the energy and excitement.  Again, it comes back to that physicality part of it, which I was so drawn to, I think, in the beginning and what I was good at.  Yes, you had to be in very good shape, I feel like, to be working there.  And I wasn’t one of the better cooks at all, not at all, although I felt ready to be a good line cook.  There were some really good cooks there, and I struggled.\n\tBut when it closed, I decided I will never have an experience like that again, nor will I have anything like France.  I had worked at Vong, which at the time was—I sort of skipped over the places where I worked.  I worked at Vong for a little while when it opened and a few other places, but nothing sort of compared to anything in France or Bouley, for that matter.  I thought I just want to take a crack at this catering and see if it can work.  But I had no kitchen, so I worked out of my dad’s kitchen at home.\n\nQ:  Oh, at home?\n\nBarber:  Yes, which is about the size of this table.  And the business grew very quickly to quite a few clients.  I was working out of his kitchen, and it was me, and I realized very quickly that I need to move out of the kitchen, get my own kitchen.\n\tThat’s when an opportunity down in the East Village—I mean, is this all of interest to you, this kind of stuff?  It’s minutiae stuff, but anyway—where La Cigale was a restaurant that opened on Mott Street.  It was just a bistro, and the owner felt that—I think it was my brother, actually, who ate there and really liked it and liked the atmosphere and introduced me, I think, maybe, to the owner.  I really can’t remember.  But she was a young woman was constantly having problems with the restaurant and the kitchen.  Her chef had left, so she asked if I would help out.\n\nQ:  The restaurant was how big?\n\nBarber:  Small.  It was similar to this restaurant.  But there was space downstairs, so I built a little kitchen downstairs, illegally.  It basically rubbed up against Chinatown.  Half the block was Cantonese, half the block was this, like, gentrification into Lolita, Nolita which was just starting then.  So the guy upstairs from me cleaned snails for Chinese restaurants.  All the dirty snail water used to drip down into the kitchen.  It was like down and out in Paris and London.  It was like one of those, like, miserable environments.  So I hired a new staff and consulting became my menu, and then on the side, I did this catering business out of the kitchen.  We didn’t serve lunch during the day.  So that’s how I was able to grow the catering business and then also do something creative with a menu.\n\nQ:  What appealed to you about the catering business?\n\nBarber:  Well, pure and simple, it was, at least from what I can understand from this point in time—I don’t even know that I have the perspective yet, but what I remember thinking constantly was, I don’t want to be ruled by a place that’s open at night all the time.  So you have your nights where, hey, if you don’t want to do a party, you don’t do a party.  You can plan.  The restaurant you can’t plan.\n\tIt’s something that no one really talks about when you’re in the restaurant business, although I think everyone understands it intuitively.  Your life, you’re in a particular kind of service industry which is constant, and in New York, it’s seven days a week.  This is open seven days a week.  That has a real effect on your life and the life of the people around you, and I couldn’t see that as a possibility.  I just actively didn’t want it.  But here I was, with all this time invested in cooking all of a sudden, and apparently I did want some part of that.  So I felt like catering was a way to control it and now consulting was another way to control it.  I could consult, but I didn’t have my name attached to the menu.  I just set it up.\n\tThen some of the people who started working for me became both active in my catering business and are still working with me today, fourteen years later, which is great.  One of them is my pastry chef, and the other one is a sous chef up at Stone Barns, and one of them just left me but was a chef for my private events.  So they all came with me through this.\n\tBut anyway, the restaurant, La Cigale, went out of business, which, now that I’m sitting here remembering this stuff, was very traumatic, because I actually ended up putting a lot of time into that menu, and I hired everybody, and I kind of ran the place because the owner was having a lot of troubles.  It slowly died a very painful death, and I say that—any business that dies is painful.  A restaurant that dies has a particular pain.  Now, I didn’t own the place, and I wasn’t working every night.  I was there a lot.  But you experience the sense of loss in a way that, like—I experienced a sense of loss that was very surprising.\n\tYes, it’s when you start to realize that a restaurant is more than just a restaurant, as most companies are or become to people who run them, family, and they become places, but restaurants really do become family.  That’s why they’re a family meal and you have all these associations, word associations to a family.  So it was very heavy for me and, like, took me by great surprise, not so much that the restaurant closed, although that too; it was more that just this place that we had built and put so much time and energy into, although, again, to be really strict about what I’m saying, because I’m being recorded, it’s like I actually didn’t put that much time into it.  [laughter]  I felt like I did.  If I worked four nights a week, it was a lot.  Now it would be a vacation, but back then it just—oh, it was so devastating, and I really feel like that experience informed the rest of my chef life.  Now, I only say that with confidence because I’ve heard that from other chefs.  I’ve heard that written about other chefs, Bouley for one.\n\nQ:  Wait.  When you say you’ve heard it written about, what was it that would be written about?\n\nBarber:  What I’ve heard is that most successful chefs have had a place close in their early career.  Now, I don’t know if that’s true of Jean Georges, but I’ve gone through this with a ton of chefs, and almost everyone I’ve asked, either they were a chef or sous chef and had a place go under.  It is both a lightning rod and the albatross around your neck, because you become paranoid that your restaurant will ever do something like that.  Not that I know this, but it’s probably like watching your house burn down, except in slow motion, and you would do everything to avoid that.\n\nQ:  The numbers are really scary in terms of how many restaurants fold.\n\nBarber:  Yes, yes, sure.  Well, that too.  It’s like not an unusual experience, an everyday experience, but when you’ve experienced it yourself, you internalize it in a way that—that’s why I say it’s so crazy.  It’s like I loved this restaurant in the East Village, La Cigale, but I didn’t build it and I had very little attachment to it.\n\nQ:  Could you have a personal life while you were there?\n\nBarber:  Yes, yes.  Yes, yes.  I wouldn’t say it was thriving but, yes, sure, I had friends.  Sure.  I had a girlfriend and, yes, yes, that was great.  So I accomplished my goal, but it didn’t work out.  It went out of business.  I probably felt guilty about it, too, because maybe if I had worked harder it wouldn’t have.  I don’t know.\n\tSo, yes, I really feel like that stayed with me.  I know it stayed with Bouley, because I’ve heard him talk about it before when he’s open to talking about it.  He had a restaurant that went under, I think in Connecticut.  You become monomaniacal, I guess, about everything, details and working.\n\tSo I was looking around for a new catering space, and I heard that this place, Washington Place, where we’re sitting now—that was the name of the restaurant, Washington Place—was not doing well, and I went in and introduced myself to the owner.  I thought I would have a great kitchen for catering and then the front area would be sort of offices.  And that’s when my brother got involved, because he was sort of helping me with the numbers.  His background is in business.  And just sort of the only way this thing worked was to have a restaurant.\n\nQ:  What year was this?\n\nBarber:  1999, ’98, ’99 is when we were first exploring this possibility.  Then all of a sudden, the guy went out of business, needed to sell, and Mario Batali, who had opened Babbo a year before or two years before, Joe Bastianich and Mario were very interested in the place and we just had to move fast, and I just made a decision that I could have a restaurant, like I could have the same setup at La Cigale, and I’d do it here but do it right.\n\nQ:  That’s very courageous.\n\nBarber:  You know, I’d like to agree with you and say it was, and there’s no way to argue that.  In some ways it was a very courageous decision, to fall off the bicycle and get back on, that’s courageous.  It was also very weak, because it had to it this sense of like—well, weak is not probably the right word, but it had a kind of neurotic quality to it, which was like instead of reevaluating, I go, “Well, what am I doing?  Do I really enjoy the catering?”  I really didn’t.  Did I really enjoy the restaurant?  Not that much, although for some reason I was devastated when it closed.  So it’s like I’m trying to be honest as I can be.  It’s like, I wasn’t fluid in my thoughts and it wasn’t clear at all.  But if I had stepped back, maybe I would have evaluated something.  Of course, I’m glad I didn’t.  I mean, we ended up where we are.  But I wonder.  I was out of breath a little bit.\nI saw all these guys who I’d spent a few years with, Ecuadorian, ended up being an Ecuadorian community of people that I just didn’t want them to lose their jobs.  Terrible.  So we flung ourselves into this space, and then my brother was my partner, my sister-in-law was the designer, and all of a sudden we were Blue Hill, in business.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nBarber:  Yes.  So I kept the catering here, and we didn’t do lunch.  The kitchen was big enough so that I could do catering and still do a dinner at night, and that’s how this all started.  It wasn’t to get into the restaurant business; it was to save the catering business, principally, in my mind, although maybe there was an ulterior motive—and I think there was—of undoing the pain of what I had just experienced at La Cigale.\n\tI rarely talk about that.  I think even now talking about it still hurts, thinking about it closing.  I don’t want to be exaggerating the thing, but it’s true.  It really did inform—and I think I’ve recognize how much it informed what I’ve done here, just because I’ve read other chefs now along the way admit to having had big failures, backers and failures and oh, my god, what it did to them.  So all of a sudden I realize I went through that too.  I just didn’t know it.\n\tSo that’s how we ended up here, very haphazardly and just sort of threw down the money quickly, and it wasn’t that much.  It was a lot at the time, but looking back, it was nothing.  I think maybe if I had slowed down and taken a breath and done all the things I said, I would never have done it.  So you never—what is that thing that Malcolm Gladwell talks about with Blink?  You just do it and you figure it out later.  Although I think Blink is wrong, not that we have to talk about that—\n\nQ:  But tell me what you mean, because I kind of think so too.\n\nBarber:  Yes, yes, because it isn’t that you make decisions in a vacuum and usually the thing that [snaps fingers] you think about in that split second is the right decision.  That’s not true.  It’s that I knew enough and I knew enough to know that, like, I was a pretty good chef, and I knew enough to know that, like, I actually did enjoy it in a certain extent, and I knew enough to be close to the people that I was working with.  I knew all these things I might not have admitted to, and I’m still not sure I understand completely, but I knew a lot.  So it wasn’t a blink decision, and by blink I’m talking about the right decision to make, in the sense that it was uninformed.  It was incredibly informed, and I knew the answer.\nThe brave part of it is that I didn’t hesitate, but I had Mario and Joe Bastianich in the middle of writing a check, so, like, I don’t want to also say that I was bold in beating them to—I just knew that this was an opportunity that wasn’t going to come by, and it was a great rent, and we should just go for it.  My brother, too, was very good about moving quickly.  I’m sure that’s true in the history of many businesses.  I don’t think it proves Malcolm Gladwell’s point.  In fact, I think it proves the opposite, is that when you really know something intuitively, you’re informed for many years, and many curiosities later, you make a blink decision, but it ain’t one blink.\n\nQ:  So then what?\n\nBarber:  Well, I don’t know where we are here.\n\nQ:  We have about seven minutes.\n\nBarber:  Oh, good, okay.  So, great, this is very good for me.  It gets me to think about things that I don’t generally think about.  But is this kind of what you’re looking for?  Okay.\n\tSo I hired a chef who I’d worked with at Bouley, Alex Ureña.  Alex was a Dominican cook who’d worked with Bouley for like eight years, and I had become friendly with him.  He had gone to work for Ferran Adrià in Spain, and back then, Ferran was sort of just beginning.  He worked in a couple of places in Spain, and when he got back, he had nothing to do.  We started talking and that’s when this thing came together.  He had nothing to do, and so I hired him as chef, and he would be the front man for the place, and I would be the catering guy, because I didn’t want to be in the restaurant business again.  It’s like, here I am fighting it.  So if you look at the early material of this place, it’s like some stuff doesn’t even list me.  I mean, it’s amazing, now that I think about it.  I don’t want to be forty years old and have a restaurant and all the things that come with that.\n\tAnyway, that was probably a little bit foolhardy in the sense that, like, well, I don’t know.  Had it worked out with Alex, maybe it would have stayed that way.  But the catering business was doing great.  It was just the restaurant was doing—just immediately it was a huge success.  We were very crowded, very overbooked, and very stressed, and the physical space was stressed for events, and the restaurant was just way, way too much.\n\nQ:  Were you cooking?\n\nBarber:  I was cooking every night, every night.  This also had Blue Hill’s name on it.\n\nQ:  And to you, having Blue Hill’s name on it meant what?\n\nBarber:  Well, at the time it didn’t mean a lot, but looking back on it, it didn’t mean a lot in the sense of, like, it was a brand identity.  There was no brand.  Today there’s a lot.  But I think to the extent that it meant anything back then, it was that it was connected to the place that I felt very happy growing up and that my grandmother and maybe my mother—it wasn’t like I was going to walk out the door.  And he was struggling, Alex, to be honest.  Not that he shouldn’t have been.  It was his first job.  We were so overwhelmed with people, and we didn’t know how to say no.  Our whole first staff that we hired turned over and it just took a lot, and I was here night and day and night and day, and catering and running the catering business, so it was both, and it was torturous.\n\nQ:  I’m a little bit worried about your time.\n\nBarber:  That’s all right.  What are we at right now?\n\nQ:  Four minutes.\n\nBarber:  Yes, okay.  We’ll push and I’ll just get to a good breaking point.\n\nQ:  What was your personal life like at that point?  Did you have time for one?\n\nBarber:  I had a girlfriend who was living through all of this with me, who I ended up breaking up with a few years into this restaurant.  We had dated for seven years, and I think this had a lot to do with it, obviously.  I didn’t know that at the time, but it was very hard, extremely difficult.\n\tSo things with Alex didn’t quite work out.  We became sort of co-chefs, and then that, of course, didn’t work out.  Then he actually quit.  We got great reviews, and I hired another friend who I’d worked with in France, and we became co-chefs together, but all of a sudden we established this and things were turning around and actually getting a little bit easier.\n\tThat’s when Mr. Rockefeller, David Rockefeller came to eat with Tim Zagat.  Tim Zagat brought him here.  But even before that dinner, the guy who set up the whole Stone Barns operation—James Ford is his name—he came often to the bar and sat and had meals and befriended me and our general manager, Franco, and talked about this project up in Pocantico Hills.\n\nQ:  That project at that point was?\n\nBarber:  Nothing.  It was a dream of James Ford and Mr. Rockefeller to have a restaurant.\n\nQ:  It was a dream to have a restaurant?\n\nBarber:  Just a restaurant.  Yes, it was not a farm.\n\nQ:  No particular principles?\n\nBarber:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But I’d have to talk to James again.  I think the thing was that in talking with Mr. Zagat, it was, “Who’s young and hungry?” and Mr. Zagat mentioned us.  Then in learning about us and learning about this connection to the farm—because, see, at this point, Blue Hill Farm was supplying this restaurant with vegetables in the late spring, summer, and fall, which was a new—the cooks went up and planted a garden.  We closed the restaurant and we were doing—and then I also worked with farmers near Blue Hill Farm and also farmers who tended our garden, so it was a small amount but it was significant because we made that connection.\n\nQ:  So your family still had what connection to the property?  They owned your—\n\nBarber:  Well, my brother and myself and my sister and my uncle all owned Blue Hill Farm and still do.  We had yet to become a dairy operation, but it was sitting there and we used it in a tiny way, in very small gardening kind of way, but we brought stuff down here, for sometimes in the summer almost every week, and I was at the farmers’ market every day.  That’s what built the whole menu was the farmers’ market.\n\nQ:  Farmers’ market where?\n\nBarber:  On 14th Street.\n\nQ:  It seemed to you normal to grow the vegetables there, unusual?\n\nBarber:  Unusual, yes.  Yes, very unusual and kind of foolhardy also, because of the amount of time and the expense.  But I wanted to base the food around the seasons and around celebrating the agriculture of the area, and that meant a connection with Blue Hill Farm, and it also meant a really steady supply of things from the farmers’ market, which I wasn’t the first chef to do that.  Of course, so many chefs were doing it.  We did it big, though.  I mean, we really—it was to the point where—not from the point; even from the moment we started, I’d have to get two cabs to load up for the restaurant.\n\nQ:  I was wondering.  That’s hilarious.  [laughs]\n\nBarber:  Yes.  Ah, those days were just—\n\nQ:  No bicycle for you.  [laughs]\n\nBarber:  Yes, right.  I didn’t do Peter Hoffman.  But we were really busy, and I remember two cabs all the time, trailing each other.  I had so much energy back then.  [laughs]\n\tAll right.  That’s good.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBarber - 1 -  PAGE 26\n\n\n\nTTT\nInterviewee:  Dan Barber\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #2\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t          New York City\nDate:  March 8, 2011\n\nQ:  It’s March 8, 2011, and I’m with Dan Barber in his restaurant, Blue Hill, in Greenwich Village.\n\nBarber:  Hello.\n\nQ:  Good afternoon.  We left off with your signing the lease for this wonderful restaurant.  So let’s talk a little bit about how it defined itself, your relationship with it, how it grew.\n\nBarber:  Almost immediately we were quite filled with diners, for a variety of reasons.  I mean, we got very good press initially.\n\nQ:  How did that happen, that you got press immediately?\n\nBarber:  New York.  [laughs]  You know, I don’t know.  The press seems to give you about an hour to open and then it floods in and gives its recommendation.\n\nQ:  Well, actually, on your website I was reading some of the things that you had written, and particularly the incident with Mr.–how do you pronounce it—Holozubiec?\n\nBarber:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Could you tell that story?  So that was about three weeks after you opened, it seemed to be.\n\nBarber:  That’s right.  I mean, it started in three.  It went on for a little while.  It was a man who our manager assumed was The New York Times reviewer, William Grimes, and so he noticed him the first time he was in, and we sort of turned the kitchen inside out to give him the best meal possible.  This Mr. Grimes character came in many, many times over the course of a few months.\n\nQ:  As a solo eater?\n\nBarber:  No, he came in with a few people, but he was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list, and it was striking that—I mean, it just made so much sense that he was a reviewer, in a variety of ways, which I wrote about for Gourmet magazine a few years ago.  But anyway, it turned out that we had a classic case of mistaken identity.\n\nQ:  Why did you think—\n\nBarber:  Well, he had a likeness to William Grimes, and once someone suggested that, no one said, “Well, wait a minute.”  Back in those days, there was no Internet pictures of reviewers, so there was no one to say, “No, it’s not,” until the day when he was in the house, somebody visited the restaurant, a friend of mine who’s a waiter at another restaurant, and I’ll never forget him walking in the kitchen, and I said, “I can’t talk to you.  Grimes is in the house.”\n\tAnd he said, “Where?  What table?”  He walked out to the dining room, looked at the table, looked at Grimes, then came back and said, “I know that’s not Grimes like I know that’s not my sister.”  [laughs]  I’ll never forget that.  This is months and months of having this guy come in, and we just really turned the kitchen upside down to give him the best possible food and service.\nYou know, it’s interesting, like what I wrote in the piece and what I really feel to this day is that it very much helped us become a better restaurant, because in our focus for excellence, we saw mistakes that were going on and a lot of—\n\nQ:  What kinds of things did you do?\n\nBarber:  Service oriented.  There’s that famous quote, “Baseball is a game of inches.”  Restaurant is a game of just half-inches.  There are so many variables to making your meal, your dining experience successful.  It’s part of the reason that so many restaurants fail and run out of energy after a certain amount of time, because these endless variables are very hard to control, and they’re extremely hard to control when you’re opening and no one is into any kind of rhythm and there’s no general sort of procedure on anything.  And so young restaurants—although today it’s a bit different, because people are just so much more professional, but back then and I think even before we opened, it’s just hard to do, hard to open a restaurant, hard to open any company.\n\nQ:  And this was your first on your own?\n\nBarber:  Yes, it was.  It was, and I was making tons of mistakes too.\n\nQ:  What kind?\n\nBarber:  I don’t think the food was quite what we wanted it to be.  We were short-staffed.  We were, as I said, immediately busy, and so it was very difficult to make that work.  At any rate, so it was an unfortunate thing that it was a mistaken identity.\n\tOn the other hand, when Grimes did eventually come, I think even though we didn’t actually recognize him, I think we were a better restaurant because we were prepared for striving for this sort of like another level of excellence, and it conditioned us to work for that and what does it mean to do that, actually, in reality, instead of just thinking about it as you’re falling asleep.  So in looking back on it, it was a sort of fruitful missed identity.\n\tAnyway, we did end up getting a review soon after from Gourmet magazine itself, which was a really kind of defining review, because it talked about our association with farmers’ markets.  The writer, Jonathan Gold, the great writer, great food writer, he came in one night in particular, I remember, where it was very late in spring and it was sort of the end of asparagus season, and I’d gone to the market that morning and had gotten all these cases of asparagus to load up, and we had like eight cases of asparagus already in the walk-in.  I was so angry that we were disorganized and we were spending money where we shouldn’t have been, and those asparagus were going bad.  So I just said, “Everything on the menu needs to be asparagus.  Everything.”  You know, one of those rageful sort of chef’s stupid moments.  So everyone took me seriously, and asparagus were added to everything, the soup, the fish, the meat.\n\tJonathan Gold came in and saw asparagus in everything, and he knew the time of year, and he’s pretty savvy at that moment about local food, and he loved it.  He loved it.  It’s the kind of thing that high-end restaurants weren’t doing, and we did it just out of this stupid anger.  When I saw it was on every dish, I wanted to reverse and have them not do it, but I’d already said it, and it was my authority, and I remember thinking, “God, what a crazy thing I just did.”  But he wrote about it.  It became the story for the piece, and it helped define who we were.  Now, we were already very supportive of local farmers’ markets.\n\nQ:  Tell me how you were trying to define yourself.\n\nBarber:  I don’t know that we were—\n\nQ:  Or if you thought of it that way.\n\nBarber:  We opened Blue Hill as a sort of celebration of everything Hudson Valley-related, and Blue Hill Farm in the Berkshires, my grandmother’s farm, we were cultivating a small, small plot there and trying to harvest the vegetables there, and some farmers who were neighbors were sending things down on the bus, on the express bus from Great Barrington to New York, and we went to Port Authority to pick it up.  So we were doing all sorts of things that, like, in small ways, that were the theme of this place, which was a regional supply of food, which not a lot of people were doing that, and I was excited by it and interested in it.\n\tSo when Jonathan Gold wrote that, it wasn’t like he was writing about a different restaurant.  It was right.  But it also defined us in a way, I think, much more than I ever imagined, and that was almost by mistake, I think, but a happy mistake.\n\nQ:  The opening date was?\n\nBarber:  I don’t know.  April of 2000.\n\nQ:  Was there anybody around that was trying to work with—\n\nBarber:  Sure, sure.  I mean, sure.  Peter Hoffman at Savoy is a big one that comes to mind.  There were others, many others that were.  Bill Telepan was doing stuff.  These are the guys who I was inspired by, so I wasn’t a trailblazer here by any respect, although I had this interest and knowledge of farming and agriculture and the issues attached to it in a way that Peter did, and not even near as much as Peter did.\n\tBut I was really interested in pursuing that because I had the farm at Blue Hill, and so that’s what I did.  It wasn’t out of any kind of political statement or out of any statement of a way to attract more diners.  It was more just like something that interested me, and, again, like the whole cooking thing, the whole being a chef thing wasn’t the burning issue with me.  It was, I want to say, larger than that.  It doesn’t need to be larger than that.  It was just different.\n\tI think today and I think for the future, it’s going to define what it means to be a chef, which is to say, like, knowing ingredients and ecologies as well as you know your kitchen and know how to cut an onion.  I mean, I think it’s going to be much more a part of what it means to be a successful chef in the future.  Back then, I don’t know that I thought that.  I just was excited to engage in it.\n\nQ:  Play out what that means a little bit, about knowing your ingredients in terms of how they’re grown and cared for.\n\nBarber:  Well, there’s a conception, a conceit, a conception that the chef’s job begins when the produce comes into the kitchen.  To the extent that you’re picking your produce, of course, you’re involved.  And then the farmer’s job ends when you drop off your produce.  But I think what we’re seeing more and more is both a collaboration with chefs and farmers and also an understanding that there’s a real need and importance to having a chef become involved all the way back to the seed that’s being chosen for a type of soil that it’s grown in and how it’s grown and when is it picked.  Those are issues that have been largely determined by other people, and when they’re done with the right kind of farmers, of course, the result is sort of magical.  But that’s just it, it’s magical.\n\tNot to put more pressure on chefs, because we already have enough pressure, but there is, I think, something very gratifying and very increasingly important for the future of how we eat, to have chefs who curate for great flavor, because when you curate for great flavor, you are sort of axiomatically making decisions about the way the world is used, about the way the soil is amended, about the kind of seed that’s picked, about the kind of system of agriculture that’s feeding you.  And that’s the blessing of being a chef and then plus being an eater who cares about food, is that when you choose to eat well—and I don’t mean foie gras and caviar, of course.  I mean when you choose to eat something that has great flavor, you have attached to it a series of decisions that go far back, long before the food comes into your kitchen, and those decisions dramatically affect the way the world is used, and so your power is intense.\n\nQ:  Let’s go back a little bit to what the situation was at the farm when you opened.  Who owned it that at that point?  How much of it was being worked?\n\nBarber:  See, that’s the thing.  When my grandmother died, actually, the farming family that was taking care of the land broke up.  They got out of farming.  So it just sort of coincided right when my grandmother died.  So the land, there was nothing going on.  We grazed some cattle and we cut some hay, but it was basically an empty ship here until we broke ground.  We basically had a garden that we were expanding it to have the cooks be involved in planting seeds and in harvesting and then also in cultivating some of the neighbors who were really interested in growing for the restaurant, which we did actually quite successfully two seasons.\n\tSo it wasn’t until four or five years ago that my brother and I got together about really reinvigorating the farm.  I knew a farmer in the area who was looking for property—his name’s Sean Stanton—and we did the same deal we have [unclear], is you come onto our land for free, and the profits that you realize are yours, but you farm the land and improve the ecology of the place and the beauty of the place through dairy farming, which is what he’s doing.\n\nQ:  Were there animals there when you started the restaurant?\n\nBarber:  No.  No, there were no animals.  We didn’t get any of our animals from there.  Because of my catering business, I was very close with a lot of farmers who were growing animals, that raised them for the restaurant, and so we, from the beginning, were mostly getting in whole animals, although I think that was different from a lot of restaurants.\n\nQ:  Whole animals here?\n\nBarber:  Yes, yes, which is very hard to do here.  I mean, people don’t really understand that when restaurants order component parts of the animal, the parts that they’re going to need for their menu.  So we started buying whole pigs.  We even got whole veal calves.  I mean, that was very hard.  We had very small refrigerators, a very hard undertaking, but, again, more interesting, and it gave an outlet to farmers that otherwise didn’t have an outlet.\n\nQ:  Who were your cooks initially?  How did you hire them?\n\nBarber:  Well, I had four guys who were with me from my La Cigale days in the East Village there, and they ended up coming over with me, and one of them became my pastry chef, the other became a kind of sous chef, and another one became a line cook, two line cooks, so I had this sort of core group of people who had worked with me, and that’s what started it.  They’re mostly still with me today.  One of them is one of the sous chefs up at Stone Barns, he’s been with me for eleven years.  No.  Oh, my god, it was 1998, so it’s been thirteen years.  That’s at Stone Barns.  Then here in New York, our pastry chef, Joel de la Cruz, has been with me for fourteen years.  He came speaking no English, and he was a porter at the other restaurant, and he trained to become a pastry chef, and now he’s a phenomenally gifted pastry chef, phenomenally gifted and talented.  So, yes, I’ve been very lucky with a great loyalty and a sense that they belong to something that’s very exciting.  So that’s nice.\n\nQ:  How did it go over with them, the idea that they would go to the farm and participate in doing whatever they were doing to the crops?\n\nBarber:  Well, we ended up organizing that like half a dozen times over the course of two years, maybe more.  We were closed back then for a day a week and so I would go up.  It was hard to do, but it was a short growing season and it was exciting.  I don’t want to make too much of it.  I mean, it was more about the connection to a place than it was to actually harvest from.  I was interested in turning the farm eventually into something that was much more productive.  This was before Stone Barns.\n\tIn fact, we realized that.  We ended up doing dairy on the place, and so we did it, and dairy supplies the restaurant.  So in that sense, we really did do it, and this helped do it, because that’s what gave us the economic wherewithal to invest in the dairy operation, in part.  So that’s a good point to reckon, and I hadn’t thought of it.  We sort of saw the dream come true.\n\tThen when Mr. Rockefeller came in to eat, which is very soon after we opened, he immediately was sort of interested in us.  He wanted a restaurant, and he was interested in us and my brother and I and my sister-in-law, who was the designer.  So it was less than two years when we were open, much less than two years, maybe a year and a half when we were open, and all of a sudden we started working towards and thinking about Stone Barns.\n\nQ:  Toward opening a restaurant at Stone Barns?\n\nBarber:  Yes, yes.  So it was very quick, and all of a sudden things shifted from Blue Hill Farm to Stone Barns and cultivating that and how do we put that together and all that.\n\nQ:  It’s really a lot for a relatively young man to balance.  How did you do that?\n\nBarber:  Well, not great.  I mean, over these last fifteen years it’s been very hard to have any kind of, like, life that feels rewarding.  Although I have a fantastic wife now, so I’ve been very lucky in meeting her.  But before that, I’ve lost touch with most of my friends.  Most of them have families, and it’s been very difficult to—like I said the other day, I was talking to a group of students about their choice of careers and just the simple facts, you give your nights when you’re in the restaurant business, whether you’re a cook or not.  Your nights are gone.  People forget that.\n\nQ:  Well, your days are pretty busy too.\n\nBarber:  And then your days are gone.  I mean, that’s true.  You don’t exactly relax in the morning and hang out.  The world is working, things are happening, and then your real day starts in the afternoon, though, of course, you’re in the kitchen early in the morning.  My point is that while the rest of the world starts winding down, you’re really revving up, and that’s a very hard thing to get adjusted to.  I still don’t.  I find it so hard and often very depressing.  Now I’ve been doing this twenty years.  You lose twenty years of your evenings, and when you have two restaurants and the restaurants are going seven days a week—this one is—it’s very hard to carve out a space where you feel relaxed.  Even if you’re not in the physical building, things are going on, phone calls are happening, as they should, and there’s no break, and it can be very worrisome.\n\tThat’s a big tradeoff that I wonder about sometimes.  You don’t get those years back, as you know, as everyone knows.  I don’t mean to sound quaint about it or melancholy about it.  It’s just a fact that once you do anything, you give up a lot, so I don’t know.  I just think there’s something particularly painful about the restaurant industry in that respect, very hard to have a family life, very hard to have a decent kind of social existence, because the world works.\n\nQ:  Is your wife in the business?\n\nBarber:  No.  She’s a writer.  She’s also a very hard worker.  I mean, anything you do, you work hard.  I don’t mean to suggest that chefs work harder, although, actually, I kind of think they do work harder than most people.\n\nQ:  Well, it’s physically incredibly demanding.\n\nBarber:  It’s physically—and the time element, so, yes.  It’s on my mind just because I was talking to these students and everyone wanted to get into the cooking and restaurant industry.  You forget and you can think sort of abstractly about working at night, but when you actually end up doing it, it becomes something altogether different.\n\nQ:  When you set this one up, did you need financial backers?\n\nBarber:  We had a few people who invested quietly, but it was a very inexpensive opening for that reason.  We’ve paid back and now we’re on our own.  Really, our staff, our management staff is really the owners of the restaurant in many respects.  They have a profit-sharing.  I mean, it’s small.  It’s small.\n\nQ:  After how long do they get to participate in it?\n\nBarber:  We just have a core group that have been here.  Franco Serafin is the general manager here in New York.  He’s been here since the opening.  The two other managers have been here for a long time now.  Our chef’s been with me for eight years, sous chef for five years, some of the other employees for a long time, so they all have points that my brother set up for our profit-incentive program.  Same at Stone Barns.  Everyone feels invested in the future.  And I think that’s been key, because the hours are what they are here, very long and can be quite grueling, and so it’s nice to think that there’s something larger than just serving food.\n\nQ:  While I was waiting for you, a reservation came in.  I think the conversation was somebody asked for an eleven o’clock reservation, and the response was, “Ten-thirty is our latest.”  I’m thinking, ten-thirty!  How many hours after that—\n\nBarber:  Surprised they said ten-thirty, because we are open till eleven.  I don’t know why someone said that.\n\nQ:  Well, but to come in at eleven and start a meal.\n\nBarber:  Yes.  On Friday, Saturday, people are sitting down at eleven o’clock, a little bit before eleven, but at eleven o’clock, and the cooks are here till one-thirty, two in the morning.  So, yes.  And then you close the restaurant and you’re out by two-thirty or three.\n\nQ:  That takes a lot of devotion to the restaurant.\n\nBarber:  Yes, yes, which is why so few restaurants end up making it in the end, because of just that kind of thing.  [laughs]  It’s hard.\n\nQ:  How long did you keep this catering business going at the same time?\n\nBarber:  Only about eight months or a year, in part because we were so successful.  I wasn’t planning for the kind of response that we had, so we literally didn’t have the space.  And plus, my interest in catering, I went in another direction.  It felt like, why are you essentially picking up a restaurant and carrying it someplace else?  Why wouldn’t you just bring people here?  And the variables, you talk about the variables in a restaurant.  The variables in a catering business, it was horrific, very hard.  The money was great and important in the beginning, but if we were going to do Stone Barns, it just made no sense to keep all this going, and so we got out of it very quickly.\n\nQ:  How long did you personally plan the menus here?\n\nBarber:  In terms of what?\n\nQ:  Literally the menu items every day.\n\nBarber:  Every day.\n\nQ:  For forever? \nBarber:  Ever.  Yes, I’m still involved in it every day.\n\nQ:  What about Stone Barns?\n\nBarber:  Every day.\n\nQ:  How do you do that?\n\nBarber:  Well, the chef here, Trevor Kunk, has been with me, like I said, for eight years, and so a lot of the dishes we have a basic understanding about.  We’re changing a lot of dishes, too, so we talk a ton.  But we’re utilizing stuff from the past and mixing it with newer ideas and stuff that we are excited about and new products, and there’s a kind of language that we speak that’s quite fluent.  So does he end up putting everything together?  Yes, but I’m involved with the conception of it and often the follow-through when I’m here.  And then up there, I’m much more involved in the menu, because it changes a lot more often, and I’m there a lot more now at Stone Barns.\n\nQ:  It changes more often because?\n\nBarber:  Because we have no menus there.  So you come and you sit at Stone Barns, and you get presented a list of ingredients, essentially, and we cook a meal for you.  So the things that come from the farm are small allotments, and we tend to spread them and change them quite a bit.\n\nQ:  How does that work in the kitchen with the line cooks and the—\n\nBarber:  It’s quite exhausting, because you’re always changing.  Even mid service, changing things is hard to have them—\n\nQ:  Even mid –service.  Wow.  Do you have, like, a daily meeting where you discuss what the dishes will be?\n\nBarber:  We have, like, two or three meetings during the day with the cooks up there.  We have a meeting at the beginning of the day, sometimes during the middle of the day, at the end of the day to talk about the next day.  It’s a very dynamic process, but adds to the frenetic exhaustion in a way that here—though here is a different exhaustion, it’s just a little bit more consistent, and up there it feels very hard, and it’s also very busy.\n\nQ:  You were talking a little bit about curating the food.  Could you play that out a little bit?  Because it’s a word that’s used now, but I think a lot of people don’t really know for sure what it means.\n\nBarber:  Hmm.  Well, I haven’t actually seen it used before, but I’m glad to hear that chefs are getting credit for it, because I guess the point of my comment about curating food is that we are easily and convincingly told what is good food, what is good for you, what is delicious, what is real, what is true, and those are usually literal advertising campaigns to promote a particular processed food or a particular product that both is not real, real in terms of the food story, the narrative that comes out of it, and also is truly not delicious.\n\tWhen I say delicious, to a certain extent that’s a personal measure.  What’s delicious to you might not be delicious to me.  On the other hand, it’s really not.  There is a true definition of great flavor, and, of course, it varies greatly, depending on the type of food we’re talking about, on the particular type of species of animal, and it can get very specific, but there’s a level of true primal taste that is important and not just philosophical in this whole issue of this movement, because I believe that true flavor is a bellwether for the type of ecology that food is coming from, because I’ve yet to taste a food that is delicious that has bad ecological decisions attached to it.\n\tSo, by definition, if a carrot tastes delicious, it has to be a carrot that was grown in the right way, had the right kind of soil, and, as I said, is picked in the right time.  A lot of decisions there that there’s a kind of recipe for that in the field that is as important, if not more important, than the recipe that I’m writing in the kitchen.  And to be able to identify those flavors and tastes and promote their cultivation is important.\n\nQ:  How do you play a role in that?\n\nBarber:  We are in a world where we’re not all growing our food and we don’t have neighbors who are buying our food.  We are in a world that for the foreseeable future is not going to be connected to an agriculture ecosystem or to any kind of cultivated land.  More and more of our population is urban than it is rural, of course.  So I don’t know that it’s realistic to be thinking that everyone’s going to be growing their own food.  I doubt it is.  But what is realistic is that as eaters, you have this responsibility, I think, to seek out responsibility of this pleasure potential, to seek out the best-flavored food.  And when you do, you are making decisions about the way the world is used, and that has dramatic effects on farming and on environment and on communities and on distribution systems, on the whole lot.\n\tMy point is that you don’t have to be an environmentalist, you don’t have to be a nutritionist, you don’t have to be anything other than somebody who just seeks good tastes.  But if you, yourself, have been so far removed from the true taste of chicken, let’s say, well, then, Kentucky Fried Chicken might very well be a fine and delicious substitute.  And for the money, in some ways it sort of is.  But I think we all would worry about a world where the definition of delicious chicken is Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Now, that’s an extreme example, but not by much, not by much.\n\nQ:  Well, Kentucky Fried Chicken, you taste the fat and you taste the spicing and whatever coating there is, but you don’t really much taste the chicken.\n\nBarber:  Right, right, right.  And I think you need, again, the arbiter of taste or the curating of taste to say—in that case, it’s not a lot of curating, but you need chefs to point the way towards these true flavors, because when you come to any restaurant that is doing that well. Let’s say you taste a carrot that’s delicious or a roast chicken that’s delicious, you leave that restaurant wanting to repeat that experience.  And if you leave wanting to repeat that experience, you’re going to spend your food dollars in a certain way to support that experience.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  This is a continuation of my second interview with Dan Barber, who has just retrieved a menu from the dining room so that we can talk specifics here.\n\nBarber:  I don’t have the farmer’s piece for today, which is the tasting menu, but I have the appetizers and the entrees, which are today’s.\n\tOkay, so what should we talk about?  Grilled Stone Barns parsnips.  Now, those are parsnips that were planted—see, it shouldn’t say that, which is why I didn’t okay this menu.  We’re going to reprint this.  What time is it now?  See, like the parsnips were dug by the cooks this week in the frozen ground.  We’re in the middle of February.  Well, it was late February when we drilled into the ground at Stone Barns and picked out the parsnips, the freezing rock-hard parsnips.  They defrosted and are so sweet, filled with sugar, and it’s one of the great pleasures of this time of year, because we have so few local fruits and vegetables, almost none, that I’m glad this is advertised.  But it’s got to say something about the digging and the thing.  I don’t know.  Anyway, we’ll figure that out.\n\nQ:  How will it be served?\n\nBarber:  Well, see, we make our own charcoal at Stone Barns, and we grill.  We have a grill on the roof here.  So we put the parsnips in the charcoal, in the homemade charcoal, and we’re going to grill it for something like two hours.  We char the skin, and it looks like a black piece of charcoal, and then we slice it.  It’s delicious.\n\nQ:  This is an appetizer?\n\nBarber:  That’s an appetizer.\n\nQ:  And among the other appetizers are what sorts of things?\n\nBarber:  What sorts of things.  Well, there’s a duck egg from the Hudson Valley, and we’re serving that with bacon from our farm.  Then shelling beans from the fall.\n\nQ:  So, very little is done to these products as you’re describing them.\n\nBarber:  Actually, a lot is done to them, to be honest with you.  [laughs]  Although it looks very simple.  But the shelling beans are eight different types of beans, and they’re all from Stone Barns or other farms, that we freeze during the winter and then cook and braise during the day, and then mix them together with a puree of vegetables actually to thicken them.  Stone Barn bacon is home-cured belly that we then smoke, again up on the rooftop there.\nThere’s a winter fruit and vegetable salad.  Those are winter vegetables and fruits, cold salad.  They’re Maine sea scallops from divers in Maine, that come to us from a great source near Blue Hill, Maine.\n\nQ:  A great source meaning someone whom you know takes care of the—\n\nBarber:  Well, it’s someone who I know has real divers diving for them, and so they’re not coated in a salt solution to preserve them.  They’re literally taken from the water and sent to us right away.\n\tStone Barns panther soybeans with the scallops.  That’s a great soybean that Stone Barns grows that is really coveted for its sweet depth of flavor, served with yellow beets and pine nuts.  We have gnocchi on the menu, ricotta gnocchi.  That’s homemade ricotta.  Jerusalem artichokes also from the fall harvest, with chestnuts.\n\nQ:  And all of these from Stone Barns rather than from the local markets?\n\nBarber:  Well, the Jerusalem artichokes are from Stone Barns and from the local markets as well, yes.  Both.  They’re sort of mixed.\n\tStone Barns greenhouse greens.  That’s all the greens from the greenhouse, where we have half-an-acre greenhouse up there.  It’s just starting to bomb with greens, because the daylight is getting so much longer.\n\tWe’re doing a pasta tonight with mushrooms and spinach.  See, I’ve got to watch this.  It says local mushrooms, but they’re not all local.  I’ve got to worry about that.  Some of them are.  It’s very hard to get local mushrooms right now.\n\tOkay, good.  I’m glad we’re going over this.  Is there any other problems?  Yes.  Boy, we’re getting to be an expensive restaurant.\n\tOkay.  Wild striped bass, pickled ginger, celery root, and bok choy.\n\nQ:  So where does the wild striped bass come from?\n\nBarber:  Right now it’s running in Long Island.  The pickled ginger is from Stone Barns.  We grew some ginger in the greenhouse.  Celery root is from Warwick, New York, and bok choy is from our greenhouse.  Wow.  A nice local dish in the middle of the winter.  You know, I’m speaking to you on the worst possible time—\n\nQ:  The most difficult.\n\nBarber:  Yes, because all the storage now is running out, and all the new stuff isn’t here yet, so March and April are the cruelest months by far.  When we get to May, we’re in a little bit better shape.  It’s really not until June when we start kicking on stuff.\n\tThere’s gray mullet on the menu from southern Spain, Veta la Palma, a great farm in the south of Spain.\n\nQ:  Is that flown to you by a distributor?\n\nBarber:  Yes.\n\nQ:  But you know the farm?\n\nBarber:  Yes, I’ve visited the farm many times.  It’s an amazing operation.\n\tHalloran Farm venison.  That’s a guy who grows venison for both restaurants, raises deer for us and only for us.  Homemade sauerkraut with that.  That’s sauerkraut from cabbages from Stone Barns that we brine.\n\tHudson Valley chicken, black-dirt carrots.  Yes, that’s carrots from Warwick, New York, with mushrooms.  And then we have a pig from Stone Barns with braised red cabbage and beets from Stone Barns, and a cauliflower steak.  We serve a vegetarian entrée, cauliflower like a steak, with dried fruit and arugula and pine nuts.\n\nQ:  The animals that you raise now on the Stone Barns property are what?\n\nBarber:  Right now raised is pigs; chickens; laying hens for eggs; and also roasting chickens, although those don’t start up again until June; turkeys; geese; honeybees; sheep; lambs.  And I think that’s it.\n\nQ:  Who is responsible for monitoring the animals?\n\nBarber:  Craig Haney is the livestock manager.\n\nQ:  Could you describe the principles, what the livestock eat, how they live, that kind of thing?\n\nBarber:  Yes, sure.  The livestock operation at Stone Barns is pasture-based, which means that the animals are primarily fed a grass-based diet.  Craig Haney is a very bright and energetic farmer, looking to take advantage of the great pasture grassland of Stone Barns and moving the animals in an intense rotation around the grass, to improve both the flavor of the animal and the ecology of the farm, which is to say caring that the grass is not eaten, is avoiding too much pressure on re-growth of grass, so that the grass can grow with all its nutrients and with all its nutrient density, without being overgrazed.  The pigs are off in the forest, grazing on the forest floor, being fed a mixture of organic grains from a local farmer in upstate New York.\n\tGenerally, the practice is to limit the amount of outside inputs that come into the farm, and that includes animal feed.  So to the extent possible, we use the resources that are on the farm, and to a large extent, that’s forty or fifty acres of woodland, so that’s woodland taking advantage of the wood pasture, which the breed of pig we have is particularly suited towards Berkshire pigs.  Then the other part is to improve the offerings of nature through good pasture management.\n\nQ:  What about slaughtering?\n\nBarber:  Well, we have a slaughterhouse on Stone Barns that slaughters smaller animals.  The pigs and the sheep have to go off to a slaughterhouse to be USDA inspected, and so there’s only a certain amount of those.\n\nQ:  All of this must take an enormous amount of organization and back and forth with the two restaurants.\n\nBarber:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Who runs that?\n\nBarber:  Well, it’s broken up to different people.  There’s somebody who sort of is the forager for the restaurants and besides stuff that we’re getting, stuff from other farms.  There’s somebody who helps me with deliveries here.  I mean, everything from up there comes here, and the compost from here goes back up there.  So we have a system that sort of works out, but it’s a lot of people.\n\nQ:  You make compost here.\n\nBarber:  Well, our trash goes towards feeding the animals up there.  Yes, we try and think of it holistically here, to the extent that we can.\nSo, yes, running a restaurant is difficult.  Running a restaurant of the kind that we’re talking about here adds complexity to the system, to the systematic running of it, but it’s also part of the system, so it’s hard to separate it.  The Stone Barns is made up of a farm, an education center, and also a restaurant, and that means the restaurant isn’t just involved in feeding people.  It’s also involved in, as Carlo Petrini likes to say, co-producing, which means more involved in the production.\n\nQ:  Actually, one of the things I wanted to ask you was, when did Stone Barns become The Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture?\n\nBarber:  At the same time it opened in 2004.\n\nQ:  And what does that mean, The Center for Food and Agriculture?\n\nBarber:  The Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture is a nonprofit educational entity to teach about sustainable agriculture.  So it teaches public school children about agriculture and about cooking, and adults and community members about the kind of work we’re doing.  It’s a nonprofit.\n\nQ:  All this to me seems like an enormously big bite, two restaurants.\n\nBarber:  Three.  Well, we have the café, too, up there, which we haven’t talked about.\n\nQ:  I’ve been there, yes.  How long did that take to set in once you opened—\n\nBarber:  The Rockefeller family had been talking about doing something at Stone Barns from the early nineties, mid nineties, and it opened in 2004, and we had been involved since about 2001 or ‘02.  Actually, it was 2001.  I said it was not even two years when we were open; it was not even a year really when we were open, when we first started talking about it.  So, yes, we were planning this in 2001, so it took a long time to get it going.  Of course, Mr. Rockefeller paid for the undertaking and so that made it a lot easier, but it got us off the ground about three and a half years from the time we were really focused on opening it to the day it opened.\n\nQ:  How educated about all these things was he?\n\nBarber:  His initial interest, Mr. Rockefeller, was to have a restaurant next to his property up there in Pocantico Hills, and I think his investment was out of the memory of his wife, who just loved the land and loved—she had a cattle operation up there going when she was alive, and she wanted it continued.  So the idea that it would expand to help feed the restaurant he was really excited about and interested in.  So did he have direct planning in the farming end of things?  Not exactly, but his blessing was always there, and I think he saw the potential for the restaurant being more than just a restaurant.  Of course he did.  He put his money behind it.  Whereas initially, the thought was like, do a restaurant that would help preserve eighty acres that was zoned for fifty-two housing lots.\n\nQ:  You mean that he could have gone in that direction?\n\nBarber:  Yes, yes, yes.\n\nQ:  But it gave you the opportunity to go in a direction that you really never would have had the money to set up.\n\nBarber:  That’s right.  I mean, we would have done it, I think, at Blue Hill Farm, and it would have looked a lot different, and it may not have ever happened, and it would have been on a scale and a scope that was very small and inconsequential, potentially.  I don’t know how consequential Stone Barns is.  I mean, it came at the right time, for sure, and many people say it led this wave.  I don’t know that it led the wave.  I think we rode a wave, in part, and with Mr. Rockefeller’s money and support, it was quite an easy wave to ride, in that sense.  Opening it was not easy, but we’ve had a lot of the luxuries, and I think timing has been one of them, that this whole movement has just exploded in a way that no one could have predicted, and it’s very fortuitous, I think, for the future of the movement.  To have a place like Stone Barns that’s walking the talk of all of this is quite important and I think increasingly will become more important.\n\nQ:  Well, if you want to talk about the movement next time—\n\nBarber:  Do you mind?  Because I think we have more to go, if you don’t mind.\n\nQ:  We have definitely more to go.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarber - 2 -  PAGE 29\n\n\n\n\nTTT\nInterviewee:  Dan Barber\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     Session #3\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t          New York City\nDate:  March 15, 2011\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is March 15, 2011, and I’m with Dan Barber at his restaurant in Greenwich Village.\n\tGood afternoon.\n\nBarber:  Good afternoon.  Hi.\n\nQ:  Hi.  I wanted to just follow up our conversation the other day by clarifying a couple of very disparate things.  I know this is going to sound a little bit corny, but you mentioned that you didn’t cook fish ahead of time, as many restaurants do.  I wondered how unusual that was and also if there were other techniques that you were careful to do that other restaurants might not bother with.\n\nBarber:  I don’t think so.  Most of the restaurants that I worked at either seared fish in advance or prepped it in a way that it falls under the definition of, like, precooking.  Not all, but a lot.  Some of the better restaurants I worked at in France didn’t.\n\tWhat I think I was saying was that David Bouley, when he opened up his restaurant and served two-hundred-people-plus a night, always cooked fish to order.  From what I understand, he was one of the first ones to do very high-level cuisine at very high numbers, with a lot of concentration on fish, and do it in that way.  So that was a revelation to me and very important.\n\nQ:  It might be seared and what else by other places?\n\nBarber:  Well, it depends.  Shellfish is cooked ahead of time and reheated.  Lobsters are cooked ahead of time and reheated.  That’s most restaurants that you work in.\n\nQ:  Really.\n\nBarber:  Sure, sure.  You don’t cook razor clams to order.  When it comes in, you have to clean them and cut them.  So they’re cooked ahead of time and then—\n\nQ:  And then the timing is, I guess, very precise.\n\nBarber:  The timing for the precooking should be very precise, yes.\n\nQ:  As to other common practices that other restaurants might do that you don’t, are there other things?\n\nBarber:  No, not really.\n\nQ:  I wanted to ask you how the idea for the non-menu at Stone Barns developed.\n\nBarber:  The menu for Stone Barns developed because we were so frustrated by the small and disparate amounts of vegetables and meats that were coming off the farm, that in order to put them on the menu, we would run out of them very quickly.  So it happened one night in particular, where we were waiting for many weeks for one of our lamb deliveries, which had been delayed and delayed, and finally we got in one beautiful baby lamb that we were very excited about.  We had been talking about it for weeks with the waiters.  We put it on the menu.  The waiters sold it in the first twenty minutes.  We sold out of our baby lamb, and now people who had waited two months for a reservation now had to be told that the lamb that was on the menu actually wasn’t from Stone Barns, it was from another farm, another local farm and delicious lamb, but it wasn’t Stone Barns lamb.  And the waiters had all been trained for this lamb.  So it became very frustrating, and that was sort of a slew of stories similar to that. I felt like the confines of an à la carte menu just didn’t work for a farm.\n\nQ:  How many people does the restaurant seat?\n\nBarber:  It seats eighty-eight.\n\nQ:  Just go through how it works now.  You have this list of ingredients, and then what happens?\n\nBarber:  We have a list of ingredients that we develop dishes from during the course of the day, and when the diner sits down to eat, they have a conversation with the captain  and your waiter, and the conversation is something along the lines of what do you like to eat, find out more about why you’ve come to the farm and why you’ve come to the restaurant and all of that.\nFor those people who have absolutely no interest in the farm or no interest in what we’re doing, very happy to serve you the steak and the stuff that just has no connection to what we’re growing.  Those are fewer and fewer people, but there are some of them.  They’re just as friendly and pleasant and great.  They just don’t really come at this—they come at it because they’ve heard it’s a great restaurant and they want to be there, and they don’t want to talk about anything else.\n\tBut then there are people like you, who would come to the farm and be really interested and want to know how something was grown and why it was picked and all the rest, and for that we have a lot of stories.\n\nQ:  And there’s a standard price?\n\nBarber:  Yes, it’s the same price.\n\nQ:  It’s all the same, no matter—\n\nBarber:  Yes.  You choose between an eight-course or a five-course.\n\nQ:  For the record, also I wanted to ask you—I mean, I think I know what they are, but your brother and sister-in-law’s names.\n\nBarber:  David Barber and Laureen Barber.\n\nQ:  Is Laureen still involved with the restaurant?\n\nBarber:  Oh, yes, yes.  She’s the designer.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  Let’s continue along the themes of your writing and your what’s become activism about food and agricultural issues, the farming issues.  What came first?\n\nBarber:  What came first.  I worked on the farm, so in that sense, maybe the consciousness.  I don’t know about activism, though, because you call it activism.  I think every chef who cooks with great ingredients, and those are most chefs that I know, are generally activists without calling themselves activists.\n\nQ:  But you speak and you write, and you write about these issues very often, so that’s why I wondered.\n\nBarber:  I appreciate that, and it’s true.  The activist makes me sort of—I don’t like activists, really.\n\nQ: Even [unclear]. [laughs]\n\nBarber:  Yes.  I meet an activist, it’s like, I don’t want to have dinner with an activist.\n\nQ:  I know what you mean.  Okay.  All right.  Call it what you will.\n\nBarber:  I think less than the writing and the speaking, although I hear you that there’s been a lot of that, it’s less that and more the canvas that I have to work on, which is from Mr. Rockefeller and Blue Hill Farm.  So I’m working off of real farms that are real economies, that have real ecologies, that we have relationships with, and there are not many of those that are out there.  There’s a lot of restaurants with connections to farmers, and that’s why I always say what I’m doing, I’m on this canvas where I can talk about these issues in an easier way, but I don’t believe that my connections to the farmers that supply us, from either Stone Barns or Blue Hill Farm, are any different than the relationships that I have with other farmers.\n\nQ:  Oh, no, I certainly hear that.\n\nBarber:  That’s why other chefs have those same relationships and can affect what those farmers are growing and can learn from what those farmers are growing in the same way.  In fact, I have better relationships with some farmers in and around the Hudson Valley that I’ve learned a great deal from and perhaps that I’ve influenced a little bit.  But they don’t have to be on your farm to—\n\nQ:  No, I understand that.\n\nBarber:  Well, most people assume that I have this kind of—the relationship even for our own property—my brother and I own Blue Hill Farm—even our own property, the farmer grows what he wants to grow, he sells it to us at a fair market value, and he sort of dictates what gets delivered.  Now, that’s an interesting way to have a farmer on your farm.  But those are things that all chefs are doing, which is why I sort of recoil at this idea that I’m kind of leading anything, because I’m speaking about what chefs are doing, which is leading a movement, and I believe that. Chefs are leading a movement, and I don’t think it’s driven by an ecological conscience, and I don’t think it’s driven by anything more than a pursuit of flavor.\n\nQ:  Really.\n\nBarber:  Yes.  I know a lot of chefs who are really devoted to this cause, for sure, and have deep knowledge and passion for it, but I think overall, you poll chefs, it’s like people just take what’s the best flavor.  What’s the best flavor is the flavor of a vegetable that’s picked at the right moment, that hasn’t traveled far enough, that was grown in the right soil.  Their interest is in good flavor.  If they’re interested in good flavor, I guess my contention is that you are then interested, by definition, in good environmental stewardship.  You have to be, because you’re not going to get good flavor.  And you’re interested in good energy use, because generally, food that’s grown with less energy-intensive inputs is better food.\nSo all of these things line up.  And food that’s grown in better soil is more nutritious because it has more flavor.  Flavonoids is part of the carriers of nutrition.  So all these things add up, and that’s why I believe as a chef or anyone who loves really good food, in the pursuit of good flavor you end up pursuing a lot of these environmental issues and nutrition issues and even community-justice issues, and a lot of things revolve around good flavor.  So if you’re in pursuit of, like, this kind of hedonism, you are activating a social movement without really even knowing it.\n\nQ:  Could you talk a little bit about food justice?  Because I think a lot of people don’t get that.\n\nBarber:  Yes, me neither.\n\nQ:  In terms of what it means, how it works, how difficult it is to achieve.\n\nBarber:  The one I was referring to is justice for the kind of workers who are involved in food production.  There’s a lot of different ways to look at food justice, but people who are—\n\nQ:  Well, that’s actually what I meant.\n\nBarber:  Oh, it was.  Okay.  So the people who are producing our food are generally not the ones making money producing our food, certainly farm laborers, but even farmers, even big farmers.  One of the great misconceptions of our food chain is that it’s the farmers, the bigger you get, the richer the farmer gets.  It’s all screwed up.  The people who are making the money are the people who are the middlemen.  It’s true of any industry, and it’s especially true of food. \n\tIt’s the people who are able to distribute the food, and it’s the people who are able to value-add the food, the people who take the food and turn it from a raw product into a product that is either pickled or preserved or mixed with other ingredients and processed and preserved.  That is where the power comes, because you value-add.  You add more economy to the transaction, and that economy generally falls in the hands of the people who are adding that value, and not the farmer, who was where the real value comes from.  So one of the problems with our food system is that in the effort to change it, the call, the reactionary voice is, if you’re a Dan Barber or if you’re a Michael Pollan, you are trying to hurt the farmer because you’re anti-farmer.\n\nQ:  I don’t understand that.\n\nBarber:  Well, the idea is that the kind of farming that Michael Pollan talks about probably represents about 4 to 6 percent of what’s farmed in this country.  Ninety-four percent of what’s farmed in this country is done primarily on larger farms, primarily through subsidized agriculture, primarily through agribusiness, primarily through a food chain that feeds into a much larger food chain.  And if you speak about the issues surrounding farmers’ markets, let’s say, or you speak about the issues surrounding CSAs or any of these issues that are part of the sustainable agriculture movement, you are, true, talking about a very small slice of the pie, and a lot of the farm lobby comes out against you and says, “You are anti-farmer.  You don’t know what it means—.”\n\nQ:  Meaning those other 96 percent.\n\nBarber:  Yes.  Meaning what it really means to produce food, you don’t understand.  And to a large extent, for me, anyway, they’re right about that.  The system, the way the system is set up, the paradigm has been working, I guess, for some people, and it does feed us.\n\nQ:  Well, you don’t mean that they’re right about your being anti-farmer?\n\nBarber:  They’re right about my not understanding the complexities and the entrenchments of what’s in place.  I mean, I’m beginning to understand.  I understand probably a lot more than most people, but still, it’s very complicated and very hard to see how our food system is going to change.\n\tI mean, look.  I love the story from a farmer who told me that—a farmer-activist.  This man’s a real activist.  He went to an industrial chicken-processing center—\n\nQ:  That’ll do it.\n\nBarber:  Yes, right.  And he took a tour, and what amazed him more than the amount of chicken that was being killed and more than the conditions that the chickens were being slaughtered in, was just the infrastructure.  It was just built—it was just a city.  He looked around and he said, “How is this going to change?  This is built.  I mean, you use a lot of money.  There’s a lot of infrastructure here, and there’s a lot of potential for growth here.  This is not going to change easily.”\n\tThat’s what our whole food system is, is big and kind of shock and awe, and that’s what, in part, drives the system, is this idea that we’re down a certain path which is highly centralized, which is species-specific, which is mono-culturing, which is processing, which is long-distance travel.  All of those things have a very large infrastructure attached to it and millions of acres of land and millions of people involved in it, and so changing that is going to be difficult.\n\tOn the positive end of it, again, sort of dialing back to our first conversation, when we talked about opening here ten years ago, very few people were talking about this issue.  So there’s a real consciousness and awareness that I think amounted to the most exciting social movement in America.  It had a long way to go.\n\nQ:  Maybe this is naïve of me.  I mean, I understand what you’re saying, but wouldn’t it be possible not to grow turkeys so that they were all breast meat and can’t fly, in order to make more money?  I mean, is that totally naïve?\n\nBarber:  Would it be possible to—\n\nQ:  To produce kind of normal turkeys.\n\nBarber:  You mean turkeys that actually—\n\nQ:  Look like a turkey.\n\nBarber:  And live outside and do all the rest of the stuff.\n\nQ:  Wherever they live, but that were not raised primarily so that they met the demands of what was desired to be sold.\n\nBarber:  So in other words, they’re raised in a more natural environment.\n\nQ:  I guess, yes.\n\nBarber:  And what’s the question again?  I’m sorry.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  In the big food system—\n\nBarber:  What would be the harm?\n\nQ:  —there could be some choices, couldn’t there?  I understand what you’re saying about the food system and how can you reduce it to simple things.\n\nBarber:  Right.\n\nQ:  On the other hand, it seems like some of the processes, if the desire for money weren’t so enormous, could be better for the animals, better for the food.\n\nBarber:  Yes, better for the flavor.\n\nQ:  Maybe that is naïve.\n\nBarber:  No, no, I don’t think it’s naïve at all.  I think your first point, though, it’s the economy of the whole thing.  It’s like a turkey that is raised in the way that we raise it at Stone Barns, for example, takes much longer to raise them.  It’s takes an extraordinary amount of space.  It takes a lot of labor to move the turkeys around to different places.  You get a happier turkey.  You get a much better-flavored turkey, but you get a turkey that’s very expensive to produce.\n\tIt’s not the fault of the industry, to a certain extent.  I mean, their point is to grow a lot of turkeys and bring it to market as cheaply as possible.  You know, it’s very easy to lambaste the big-agriculture food chain.  What’s harder to do, and I think ultimately more interesting and what I’m trying to write about, is to look at what drives all of that, and why do big players—how do they become big, and what drives them.  Because I think when we better understand that, we’ll be better positioned to look at a future food system that is going to face dramatic changes, because what’s driving the ability of big food to produce food so cheaply is largely very free ecological resources that are not going to be available in our lifetime or in our children’s lifetime.\n\nQ:  Explain that a little bit more, these free resources.\n\nBarber:  A free ecological resource would be cheap oil, for example.  Our system is built on $30 a barrel of oil, as one activist rightly argues, and a system with oil that costs $130 a barrel is a price that the food system can’t afford.  So if you’re a Purdue chicken producer or turkey producer, you’re dripping in oil, from the amount of grain that gets fed your turkeys and chickens, to the amount of energy it takes to build a structure that I described before, to the amount of energy it takes to transport your chickens across the country, to the amount of energy it takes to process your chickens in the chicken fingers.  All of that is based on very cheap oil, so that’s not going to last, I don’t think.  I mean, maybe you have another thought about oil.  I don’t know.  But that kind of resource—\n\nQ:  Not this week.  [laughs]\n\nBarber:  Yes, right, not this week.  Exactly.  I mean, look at what’s happening.  So where are we headed with this?  We’re probably headed with a food system that by default is going to have to become more localized than centralized, and more localized, less centralized, more regional.\n\nQ:  And more expensive.\n\nBarber:  You’re probably going to have to pay the real cost of producing food.  Yes, probably.\n\nQ:  That’s what I think people don’t understand.\n\nBarber:  Yes.  Food is subsidized.\n\nQ:  I mean, do you get a lot of, “I don’t want organic food.  It’s too expensive”?\n\nBarber:  No.  I get accused a lot of being elitist in this whole thing, that what I’m talking about is an elite idea and that you can afford to serve a restaurant with sixty seats, but you’re really talking about feeding the world, and how do you answer that for a turkey that costs so much more money to produce.  We have 900 million people who are starving now.  That’s 300 million more than thirty years ago when we launched the Green Revolution.  We have a billion people who are food-insecure, and we have a billion people who are overfed and over-nutrified.  That’s a system that’s failing.  If 50 percent of the 6 billion population have horrific issues with food, that’s a food system that’s failing.\n\nQ:  Do you mean diabetes and that kind of thing?\n\nBarber:  Obesity, yes.\n\nQ:  When you and Mr. Rockefeller came to an understanding about what you’d be doing there, did he have strong feelings?\n\nBarber:  It’s a really interesting—I thought you were going in [another direction]—the Rockefellers were very large proponents of the Green Revolution and gave quite a bit of money to especially wheat research in Mexico that ended up saving hundreds of millions of lives then.  My question always was, how much of that did David Rockefeller know and understand, and was this a new direction for the Rockefeller family in terms of it was sustainable, small-scale agriculture, not something that they invested in largely.  Largely, their history is with what launched the Green Revolution, which is essentially the advent of modern agriculture, and a lot of people criticize them for it, fairly or unfairly.\n\tSo did Mr. Rockefeller and I or my brother have any conversations about it?  No, not in that respect.  I think his desires were much more simple, although I could be wrong.  In terms of what was articulated, it was mostly just about wanting to have a place that served really good food and that preserved the memory of his wife.\n\nQ:  And that would have the use of that particular land?\n\nBarber:  His wife really loved the land, and so the fact that we would be farming it made him very happy, because he felt like it was a great service, in service of his wife’s memory.\n\nQ:  I’m sorry, remind me.  How many acres is it?\n\nBarber:  Stone Barns is eighty acres.\n\nQ:  And you farm on approximately how much of it?\n\nBarber:  Well, we farm on as much as we can.  We have twenty-five acres of pasture and about eight acres of horticulture, and the rest of it is woodland, which we generally farm pretty intensively with the pigs.\n\nQ:  You talk very articulately about all of this now.  How long have you been able to do that?\n\nBarber:  [laughs] Thanks, but not long.  I’m still learning about all this.  Like I said, I do think it’s very easy that now that it seems like quite a few more people are conscious about these issues, we’ve entered into an area that I think is a little bit dangerous, which is painting these black and white pictures of what’s good agriculture and what’s bad agriculture.  There’s a lot of bad small-scale farming, a lot of terrible small-scale farming, and the fact that a farm that raises 1,000 pigs is better than a farm that raises 100,000 in a confined –animal-feeding operation, it’s true there are some bonuses for the small family farm that raises 1,000, but if they’re raising it in the same way, you know, their farm is only raising pigs, they’re bringing in grain from the Midwest, etc., they’re generally not doing anything much better than the confined feeding operation, although the pigs live a happier life in general.\n\tMy point is that when these free ecological resources, like fossil fuel, like water, like global climate change or any kind of instability in our ecosystem, which we’re clearly seeing more of in different places in the earth—those are three; labor would be another one, I guess—we’re going to end up having a lot of problems with small-scale bad agriculture.  And by bad, it’s hard to make a sweeping statement about it, but it’s true.  If you’re not thinking in an ecological way, and you’re thinking even small-scale intensified production, I think for the future is probably a lost cause.  Anyway, my point is that it’s hard to do these black-and-white, big farms are bad, small farms are good.  There are a lot of good big farms, too, great ones.\n\nQ:  Like what kinds of farms?\n\nBarber:  West of the Mississippi are big farms.  We have this idea of the Thomas Jefferson sort of yeoman farmer idea of the idyllic American farm, and what we all aspire to, these small family plots, that was a romantic idea wrapped in a bewildering reality, which is that there’s no water west of the Mississippi.  Jefferson was talking about the thirteen colonies, which was wet agriculture.  That’s where we are.  That built us in the beginning, but if you’re moving out west and you’re in California, you have to have a large farm because you have less water sources, and that’s the way it works.  And the grasses in many areas aren’t like New England, and on and on.  So we have this sort of romanticized vision of what a farm should look like.  I don’t know that that really adds up to realities of certain parts of the country or of the world.\n\tSo, big farms can be okay.  They can be great.  Big cattle farms, I’ve been to one in Arizona that pastures its beef cattle and moves them around in huge numbers, that does a great job of managing the grass and moving the animals in a way that’s actually quite beneficial to the landscape.\n\nQ:  I think most people don’t know, really, how very educated you have to be to be a farmer of any size, and how much you have to know about, way beyond you own farm.\n\nBarber:  That’s right.  That part of the big problem is our conception of brilliance is kind of over-determined with the Bills Gateses and the Steve Jobses of the world, this idea that you’ve built a thing and that’s brilliant.  But if you look at a farmer who uses current energy on the farm, energy from the sun that gets transferred to the plants to feed the animals that feed us, and works with companion planting and works with healthy soils, and amendments that are produced on the farm, you’re talking about a very brilliant person.  And the fact that there are not a whole lot of them in our future is a part of what you just said, which is that we have a great lack of appreciation for that kind of thinking, which I think is sort of biological.\nWe don’t give a lot of credence to biological thought, especially ecological thought and those connections and seeing all that.  We tend to take our best students, and they go off to these jobs where they’re considered where bright kids go, and the sort of dumber kids go on farm jobs, and that’s how it’s been for the last forty years, fifty years.  And understandably, in some way, but in farm life, it shouldn’t be glorified.  It’s very hard work.  But everything is hard work.  Everything is hard work.  [laughs]\n\tI think about the education part of it, and I think there’s a lot that we could do on a university level.  And I think about the land-grant universities, of which I’m going to next week, to Cornell.  There’s a land-grant university in every state, and its M.O., its modus operandi, when it opened was to educate the state about farming techniques.  The farmers would come to the university and have all these available ideas.  That was set up because our politicians in Washington were worried that we didn’t have enough to feed a growing population and that we needed regional expertise on growing techniques and soil analysis and seed distribution.\n\nQ:  I don’t know when the land grants were set up.\n\nBarber:  1890s.\n\nQ:  Across the country?\n\nBarber:  Yes.  Every state had to, and you got federal money.  I mean, it was a brilliant idea.  It was one of the most brilliant overlooked ideas of the success of this country, because it established a food security that we never had and that many were fearing, and rightfully so, that as the country expanded west and we grew in population, we wouldn’t be able to feed ourselves.  This was our ticket, and that’s where a lot of seed varieties came from.  That’s where all breeders—I mean, they funded breeders, breeders who were breeding vegetables and fruits and breeding newer varieties of animals, selecting, naturally selecting for hardier breeds of cattle and pigs for particular landscapes, hot arid environments, cold winter environments.  That’s what helped feed us, and it was enormously successful.\n\tIt’s been de-funded in the last thirty years, based on deregulation of everything, and, in part, those breeders have been left to accept money from agribusiness, because if you’re a breeder now at any one of these universities, and they’ve cut breeding programs almost to the bone—Cornell actually still has one that’s somewhat thriving.  But if you’re a breeder at Cornell, for example, you need to justify research on a trial of a seed.  You can’t just go and do it.\n\nQ:  Is it funded through the Farm Bill or something else?\n\nBarber:  Well, the Farm Bill has funding for land-grant universities.  What has been de-funded is on a university level, to continue the specific support for different programs like agronomy.  All the departments have been cut.  In particular has been the breeding program, and the reason for that has been because the money has been flowing in from corporations that say essentially, “We’ll give you a donation and, oh, by the way, if you’re working on a tomato variety that—.”  Now, they’re not saying, “I want a tomato variety that’s filled with flavor and nutrients.”  They’re saying, “I want a tomato variety that can grow in these kinds of conditions and can be picked green and can travel 3,000 miles.”  That’s how they make their ends meet.\n\nQ:  So how does that result in de-funding?\n\nBarber:  The university—well, for Cornell and for several others I’ve looked into—either takes money and puts it in other departments under the quasi of agriculture, or lets it go altogether, knowing that they’ll be able to match and supersede those funds from corporations, who themselves don’t want to hire a breeder full-time.  They already have their breeding departments.  They can save a great deal of money by spreading it to different universities.  It’s an ingenious way.  I mean, if you’re a company and you’re looking for new seed varieties that will help either a particular area of the country that you’re in or help a new generation of fertilizers and pesticides based on a particular seed, you go through the university and you essentially get free R&D.  That’s what’s been happening in our country for the last thirty years.  It’s a side note, but it’s very interesting, I think, and partly why I’m going up to Cornell, because I want to write about it.\n\nQ:  What are you going to Cornell for?\n\nBarber:  I’m going to Cornell to speak, but I’m meeting with all these breeders, many of whom have retired, who I want to talk to, and some who are on the verge of retiring, and some that are young and really fired up.  This whole generation of breeders came up to Cornell in the seventies, the hippies up there, and were there to change the world and to breed nutrient-dense vegetables and organic seed varieties and all that, and they’ve all pretty much been replaced now by a younger generation and the need to be accountable to funding that comes in.\n\nQ:  So what are you going to talk about?\n\nBarber:  I’m going to give a kind of standard little thing just about all this stuff, sort of, from the chef’s perspective.\n\nQ:  I wasn’t living here, but the first time I was aware of your writing about all of this was “Amber [Fields of Bland],” [title misstated and corrected] because that was a real knockout punch, and it was huge real estate in the newspaper.\n\nBarber:  Yes, they were very kind to me.\n\nQ:  How did that come about?  Why don’t you explain for the record what it was?\n\nBarber: “Amber Fields of Bland” was an Op Ed that I wrote for the Times, I can’t remember now, two years ago or three years ago.\n\nQ:  Longer.\n\nBarber:  Longer, was it?\n\nQ:  I think so, yes.\n\nBarber:  Oh, god.  Anyway, I wrote my first Op Ed for the Times the first year we opened.  Was it the first year or the second year we opened here?  And then every year, I think, I was doing one at around Thanksgiving time for many years, and then I think I had a couple of interruptions.  But there was an editor there, who actually just left last month, which is very sad to me, David Shipley, who was amazing, just a big foodie, and we got talking, and he increasingly saw these connections between food and politics and between food and energy and between food and everything, and he opened that up to me, which was a really great blessing, and I feel very thankful for it, because it gave me a voice in this whole movement that I didn’t have.\n\nQ:  You wrote Op Eds, obviously, before that big piece.  How did you decide what to write about?\n\nBarber:  I wrote Op Eds before the “Amber Fields of Bland”?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBarber:  How did I decide?\n\nQ:  They were things on your mind?\n\nBarber:  Yes.  The first one I did was this sort of apple piece, comparing two apples to each other, one at the Greenmarket and one across the street at a cart that was selling off the street from Mad Apple from South America.  But I just got these ideas.  I don’t know how.  I was just really interested in these issues and always had been, going back to college.  But I became more focused as Stone Barns opened and all the rest.\n\nQ:  How did you make time for that work, the writing?\n\nBarber:  Well, I’m not sure, because I’m trying to figure out how to make time to write the book, so I don’t know.\n\nQ:  What is your book?\n\nBarber:  What is it about?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBarber:  A lot of the issues that I’m talking about.  They’re stories, though, that are about specific sort of experiences with farmers that have led me to kind of understand why something tastes good.\n\nQ:  Does it have a name?\n\nBarber:  No.  No, it’s probably halfway done or two-thirds done, something like that.  No name yet.\n\nQ:  But David Shipley was then enormously helpful to you to continue this line of thought.\n\nBarber:  Yes.  He was a great editor and a very great encourager and famous encourager of anything that he found interesting.  It was great.\n\nQ:  Did you meet here at the restaurant?\n\nBarber:  No, no.  I just blindly sent it to him.\n\nQ:  That particular piece?\n\nBarber:  Yes, the first one.\n\nQ:  Oh, I see.\n\nBarber:  And I got a note back a day later.  He’s like, “I love it.”  And that was the beginning of just a great friendship, which I hope doesn’t end.  He’s off at Bloomberg News now, but I hope I don’t lose contact with him, because he’s a major, major, great editor.  You don’t find many like that, at least I don’t.\n\nQ:  But just to get back to “Amber Fields of Bland” for a minute, I’m sure you know it was much longer and more detailed than most pieces, and so there had to be a decision on the part of the newspaper to make that available to you.  I don’t know whether he had to fight for it or—\n\nBarber:  Well, he’s the editor, so he decides that.  And usually he decided it based on, like, was it an interesting perspective, had it not run before, and was there something there that was gripping readers, and he found there was.\n\nQ:  The idea, as you articulated it, did it start with flavor or what?\n\nBarber:  You know, it didn’t.  He’s the one who—\n\nQ:  Who found that?\n\nBarber:  Yes.  He’s the one who said, “You know, you shouldn’t be writing like Michael Pollan.  You’re a chef.”  He said something like that.  “So why are you coming at it from this angle?”  It’s like, “This still is new and fresh, and we could go, but your expertise is in flavor, and I don’t understand why you’re not concentrating on it.”  He was right, and that changed a lot of what I ended up talking about way beyond “Amber Fields,” and it’s what I’m talking about today.  He really focused me on, like, this is about flavor, because if it’s about anything else, it’s boring.  Plus, I don’t have any expertise in all the other stuff.  I just have knowledge, not an expertise.\n\nQ:  How did that piece come about?\n\nBarber:  The “Amber Fields”?  It was a yearly thing that I was doing, I think, so I always was gearing up for something.  This idea that I was sending him ideas that he was accepting or rejecting, but it’s not really—I would just send him an idea, and he would work with me until he found it acceptable, which most editors, obviously, don’t do.  He was very, very, now that I’m saying it, very particular.\n\nQ:  When did you start to speak?\n\nBarber:  I started speaking sort of at the beginning, I guess because chefs get these invitations to speak.  I don’t know.  I can’t remember what my first couple of ones—I have to ask Laureen about that.  But as this issue became more and more accepted or mainstream, the invitations to speak about it became more frequent.\n\nQ:  This is slightly corny, but is it, in part, because your education made you write papers all the time, that you could do this?\n\nBarber:  Yes, maybe.\nI never thought of that but, true, I have probably an extensive education compared to most chefs, and I had an interest in writing, so those probably came together in a way that was very unconscious.  I think by the time I wrote the first Op Ed, we were planning this thing at Stone Barns, and I wanted to try and get people to understand what we were headed out to do.\n\nQ:  Has that changed, by the way, what you’re doing at Stone Barns?\n\nBarber:  Versus what we thought?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBarber:  Of course, only because it’s been ten years.  But in terms of I think what your question is, more sort of macro, the underpinnings of what we were trying to accomplish I think is exactly the same.\n\nQ:  Could you describe what it is?\n\nBarber:  It’s very simple, just that there’s an Education Center, a farm, and a restaurant, and that there’s these three entities that are working together to talk about sustainable agriculture and the future of eating and cooking and enjoying food, and those three entities are quite important to have an understanding of how that works.  You can’t really get that from just going to a farm.  You can’t really get that from going to a restaurant.  You can’t really get that from just going to a classroom.\nBut when you have three together, when you have those three entities together—and they could look very different.  I always say is Stone Barns replicable.  I mean, it’s just Rockefeller money.  It’s like, well, it is, actually.  If you don’t take it so literally, and you look at a place like, I don’t know, North Dakota, you have a school and you have a farm, and a farmer’s daughter goes to the school, and you have a principal who’s smart about capitalizing on this farmer and serving his ground beef in the cafeteria, and then teaching about the economies of raising a steer on grass and the taste difference in a cooking class or the biology class, so you have all this together that ends up educating and inspiring in a way that I think is much more productive than doing it within one entity or on your own.\n\nQ:  How much time do you give to that at Stone Barns?\n\nBarber:  To the Education Center?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBarber:  I mean, I do, probably not enough, but I’m on the board and I am very involved in certain activities.  The day-to-day runnings, I’m not.\n\nQ:  But you’ve been writing in other places besides the Times.\n\nBarber:  Yes, I’ve written in a lot.  So I wasn’t always just about these issues.  I was published in Food & Wine, I think, and Gourmet magazine.  I just tried to write more and more about these issues because it’s what interests me.\n\nQ:  How did you fit that into your schedule?\n\nBarber:  To the time, yes.  You know, I do very well late at night.\n\nQ:  Very late.  [laughs]\n\nBarber:  Yes, it’s very late at night.  Also, it’s become easier because I’ve had a great group of people, phenomenal.\n\nQ:  You mean here?\n\nBarber:  And up at Stone Barns.  Yes, great, and as that happens, you—I mean, how did [Barack] Obama write a book that he wrote when he was doing all of his stuff?  It’s like, how do people—I don’t know.  You have something to say, and you fit it in in different times.  It’s taken me a long time to write this book, many, many years, so I’m not exactly the most productive guy in the world.\n\nQ:  I don’t know about that.  Do you have a due date?\n\nBarber:  Yes.  Thirteen months ago.  My contractual due date.  I am quite, quite late, so that’s been one of the things that weighs on me.\n\nQ:  I noticed, because I was there, that you spoke at Michael Batterberry’s service.\n\nBarber:  Were you there?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBarber:  Oh, I’ve forgotten you were friends, friendly with him.\n\nQ:  Well, I wrote a little bit for him.\n\nBarber:  Oh, you did?  Okay.\n\nQ:  I found him amazingly supportive, given what the magazine is about, which is for chefs and has lots of technical things, the recipes and things like that.  But he was also very interested in educating chefs about agriculture.  Is that how you got involved with him?\n\nBarber:  And that’s what you wrote about?\n\nQ:  Well, he did actually ask me to write something some years ago about what chefs needed to know about the Farm Bill.\n\nBarber:  No kidding.\n\nQ:  That’s what I said.  [laughs]\n\nBarber:  Great.  I think I remember that piece.  Did it run?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBarber:  I think I remember that.\n\nQ:  I just wondered how the two of you—and I guess for the purposes of this, I ought to say that he was the publisher of Food Arts, which is a magazine—\n\nBarber:  And editor.\n\nQ:  —and editor of a magazine for people in the food industry, as opposed to philosophical in any way.\n\nBarber:  Right.  I met him because I graduated from—I went to cooking school, I went to French culinary, and I think I got back from California and I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do, so in that phase, and so I just wrote him a note and said, “Would you sit down and chat with me?”  And he did, and he was wonderful, a wonderful man.  Oh, wow.  Just really took a great interest in me, and I think I probably spoke to him once every two weeks for twenty years or fifteen years.\n\nQ:  Good heavens.\n\nBarber:  Yes.  I didn’t really even realize that when he died.  It’s one of those things that became such a part of my life that it wasn’t as if—I didn’t see him that often, so I wasn’t going to dinner with him, but I’d go to his office probably once a month, once every two months, but I was talking to him on the phone it seemed like all the time.  I really miss him.  There are not many people like that in the industry, as you know.\n\nQ:  It must be very unusual to have somebody who is essentially putting out a magazine take that much interest in the agricultural situation, in the population that produces it, in the immigrant farmers, that kind of thing.\n\nBarber:  Yes, yes.  He was amazing.  But, you know, that was Michael.  He was so smart and looking at connections and looking beyond just the next issue.  So, you’re right, he was a very extraordinary man.\n\nQ:  Do you have anything scheduled besides your book that you’re supposed to be writing right now?\n\nBarber:  No.  I’m not writing anything.  I’m doing some speaking stuff, but I’m hoping to relate that to the book.\n\nQ:  What about the President’s Council on Physical Fitness?  There you are amid all these athletes, these quarterbacks and basketball players.\n\nBarber:  You know, what’s interesting about the Council this year is that it’s the first year, the first administration that’s, first of all, changed the name.  It was the President’s Council on Sports and Physical Fitness.  He changed it to the President’s Council on Sports—I’ve forgotten what it is—Food and Nutrition.\n\nQ:  Physical Fitness and Sports—\n\nBarber:  No, that’s that old one.  So it’s expanded to—it has the words, I think, Food and Nutrition.\n\nQ:  It does have Nutrition in there somewhere, yes.\n[The name is President’s Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition.]\n\nBarber:  So I’m not just with athletes.  I’m with a pediatrician; I’m with a doctor; I’m with a woman who runs the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nQ:  But not other chefs.\n\nBarber:  No other chefs, not right now.  But it’s the first time that this group has been expanded, and it’s, I think, obviously a very smart way to look at what it means to be healthy.  It’s got to include food, and it’s got to include good food.  And that definition, broadening that definition is quite important, and I feel really honored to be a part of it.\n\nQ:  How does it function?  Do you have meetings or what?\n\nBarber:  We have conference calls quite a bit and then twice-yearly meetings in D.C., one coming up at the White House, actually.\n\nQ:  Who asked you—was it the president or the first lady’s staff—to be on it?\n\nBarber:  The first lady actually has nothing to do with it per se, because it’s the President’s Council.  But the first lady has a lot to do with it because of her initiative, so, yes, I think it came from the first lady’s—you know, from the East Wing as opposed to the West Wing.\n\nQ:  Did you have any idea what you were supposed to do, being on this?\n\nBarber:  No, I had no understanding of it, and I still am not quite sure.  It’s sort of like a week-to-week thing.  But if there’s a radio interview or there’s this thing that just talks about Let’s Move, which is her big push to get people to eat healthier, so I’ve been involved with that.\n\nQ:  You mean if they are asked to produce somebody who can talk about that aspect of fitness or another aspect of fitness, they call upon one of you to—\n\nBarber:  Yes, exactly.  They kind of filter all the stuff through to the right people.  So, yes, the athletes are going off talking to school kids, and I did an event in Midtown with school kids and Billie Jean King, which was fun.  So anyway, it’s a learning experience.  It’s been great.\n\nQ:  Is there anything else you’re trying to fit into your life at this point?\n\nBarber:  Yes.  Well, I’d love to have a family.\n\nQ:  That would be nice, yes.\n\nBarber:  I just got married a year ago, a year and a half ago now, so I’m quite happy about that and thrilled to spend time with her and, again, yes, and hopefully have a family of my own.  I’d love to.\n\nQ:  Is there anything I haven’t asked you about that you would like to—\n\nBarber:  No.  This has been the most exhaustive, but not exhausting, interview, interview or talk, confessional.  I don’t know what it is.  Everything.  Thank you for taking the time.  It’s been so lovely.\n\nQ:  Thank you for participating.  It’s really terrific.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarber - 3 -  PAGE 36\n\n\n\n","description":"The youngest person to be interviewed for this project (a 1992 graduate of Tufts University), Dan Barber is nevertheless a celebrity chef with multiple James Beard Foundation awards to his credit.

It's March 24, 2011, and I'm with Lidia Bastianich in her restaurant Felidia on the East Side of Manhattan. \nGood afternoon. \n\nBastianich: Good afternoon. \n\nQ: I would love it if we could start with your telling me something about your childhood both in Istria, Trieste, and your family situation there and your grandmother. \n\nBastianich: My name is Lidia Matticchio Bastianich and I came to the United States in 1958 as a young immigrant; I was twelve years old. My story takes place in the aftermath of World War II when the borders of Italy were redesigned due to Italy losing the war. Italy has twenty regions, and I came from Friuli Venezia Giulia, which is the farthest northeastern region of Italy. Today Friuli Venezia Giulia borders Austria to the north, Slovenia to the east, and the Adriatic Sea to the south. \nI was born specifically in Istria, which was Italian then, but after WWII and Italy’s loss in the war, Italy acceded part of its territories, Istria and Dalmatia, to the newly formed communist Yugoslavia. It took a few years for the borders to be decided and the NATO forces were minding the region and keeping everybody calm until a decision was ultimately made in February of 1947. I was born in that turbulent February, when the decision was made that the Italian border would come down from Austria into the Adriatic, and Trieste would remain Italy while Istria and part of Dalmatia would become part of Yugoslavia. \n\nQ: That must have been fairly frightening for people who were-- \n\nBastianich: It was very frightening. Three hundred and fifty thousand ethnic Italians were displaced. They picked up their belongings and moved back behind the newly formed border into to Italy. Moving back to Italy in the aftermath of a war with just suitcases and what one could carry was not a promising situation. There were no jobs to be had, there was no lodging to be found; the immigrants went to live with relatives they had in Italy, if any. \nBut since I was just born in that February, my mother and father decided to remain in Istria for a while, until I and my brother four years my elder grew a bit.  My first years were spent under communism in this insecure setting where we were not allowed to express our nationality. We were Italian; at home with my mother and father we spoke Italian, but once the Iron Curtain went down and once the border was finalized, tough communism set in and everything changed. \nAs Italians, our names changed. We could not speak Italian. We could not go to church. We could not practice our religion. My mother was an Italian schoolteacher, but she had to follow the regimes and rules, and speak only Yugoslavian.  Being on the border, one speaks several languages. I speak five languages, my native language being Italian, but I speak what is now called Croatian and several other languages of the bordering countries as well. \nTo protect me and safeguard our Italian heritage, my mother had me spend a lot of my formative years with my grandmother in a little town outside of the government’s reach, the town where I could grow somewhat in peace, where I could speak Italian unnoticed and where my grandmother could take me to church.  The beauty of it all in this turmoil was that my grandmother, living in the countryside, grew everything we ate and raised all kinds of courtyard animals. \nNot bearing the political upheaval, I grew up in a wonderful natural setting, where alongside my grandmother, I developed a direct connection with the earth, with the seasons, with the production of food, the curing of food from one season to another. I was part of the drying of the beans, the preserving , canning, the drying of the lush summer bounty food for the lean winter months. Grandma raised chickens, ducks, geese, goats, pigs, donkeys, and squabs. All of that happened in a courtyard with an extended garden while my grandfather made wine, harvested the olives, and pressed them into luscious olive oil in and around November. They grew and harvested wheat, and my grandmother would go to the communal mill periodically, not milling the wheat for the whole year but just as much as she needed and would go back for more the next month or so. \n\nQ: You made your own wheat. Wow. I didn't realize that. \n\nBastianich: Yes, yes, we planted and harvested it in late June or whenever it was ready. I recall the big machines coming and cutting the wheat, then tying it into a bunch, and ultimately beating the tied wheat until all the wheat kernels fell out. She would keep those precious kernels of wheat in a dry room, actually on the floor, and turned these kernels of wheat periodically so they would aerate. Then she would bag them in burlap bags and when she needed the flour, off to the local mill we would go. And it was on a barter system. We would bring three burlap bags of wheat kernels and returned home with the flour, but not after leaving part of the newly milled flour as payment. So when we cooked, the flour was fresh, the olive oil just pressed, we grew all the vegetables, had the protein in the courtyard, everything was pure and unadulterated. \nIn the springtime, we planted our onions, our garlic, collected them in the summer, let them dry, braided them, the hung them in the little curing house for the winter. The beans, we ate our fill while they were still fresh and whatever string beans were extra, Grandma would let them mature and dry on the stalk in the field first, and then she would collect the stalks with the dried bean pods and hang them on the clothesline until they would be bone dry. Us children would take the pods off the dried stalks and open the pods, and shell the dry beans. My connection to food was ever so basic and pure. I would go with my grandmother and harvest the potatoes as well. She had helpers, but I loved it all and she would, with a plow, row by row, pluck the potato plant out of the earth. She collected the big potatoes from the roots of the plant, but my job was to go behind her with my little basket and collect the fingerlings, the little potatoes, the baby potatoes, the best ones. \nMy feeling and understanding and connection to food go back to those moments. When you pick up a potato and it's warm from the sun, from the earth, it's as if that potato has life, and for me that sensibility still exists in my hand. I can still feel that warm potato. So I look at a potato in a different way with this sensibility. When you take the potatoes just out of the earth and you fry it in fresh olive oil just made, those flavors are the pure flavors of food, and me, that is my reference library of flavors. Hence, whenever I cook, I search for those flavors. How can I make the food that I cook match the flavor I remember? \nI also recall playing hide and seek and hiding in the tall hedges of bay leaves and rosemary, and once we were discovered and came out of our hiding place, we smelled like those hedges, I would smell like rosemary for days. \nAs I child I was absorbing all of this, and certainly did not understand then that a passion for food was growing in me. It was not preprogrammed, but I guess for each one of us there is a path, a destiny and if we are lucky enough to identify and follow it for the rest of our lives, we then live a fulfilled, happy, and gratified life. \n\nQ: That's wonderful. \n\nBastianich: Yes. Going to bed was aromatic and fun as well. Grandma had woolen mattresses, made from the sheep’s wool, but in the summertime the mattresses would get washed. We would un-sew them, wash the wool, and stretch it out to dry. To hold us over, Grandma and helpers would make temporary mattresses filled with cornhusks, dried cornhusks, that is. I recall sleeping on those dried cornhusks—the whole night there were strange noises from moving about on those husks, but the best was sleeping in the smell of corn from those corn husks—these are the different memories that I have of food, which remained forever in my mental flavor library. \n\nQ: Who cooked there? \n\nBastianich: It was very simple. It was Grandma and a great-aunt. The courtyard was the epicenter of the family. The younger generation like my mother had moved to the city to work while the elders remained in the court yard. We had a house in the city, but the courtyard was an escape for everybody and a source of food and good nourishment, especially as the new communist regime tightened on people. \n\nQ: This was actually across the border? \n\nBastianich: I was born in Pola—now it’s Pula—which is a city in the Istrian peninsula, which is about forty minutes south from the now Italian border. \n\nQ: But your grandmother's house was on what side of the— \n\nBastianich: It was part of the land that became Yugoslavia. We were caught behind the Iron Curtain. \n\nQ: I see, but nevertheless, it was the country. \n\nBastianich: Yes, where my grandmother lived was in the country outside of Pola. The city was Pola—or Pula now—and the country home was just a little town outside of Pula. That's where I spent my formative years. \nBut due to the unbearable communist situation, in 1956 my mother and father decided that they needed to take their children away to freedom and give them an opportunity for a free life. The new regime, Yugoslavia, would not allow the whole family to leave and go out of the country together; they knew that the family would not return. So my mother, my brother, and I were allowed to go to Italy because on the other side of the border we had relatives, but my father had to remain behind. \nMy father remained as the hostage, but my father did escape. After the month that we were away he did escape, which was the plan between my mother and my father. But we children didn’t know that. He escaped through the border, where they shot at him but thank god he made it and met up with us. I remember he came to my aunt’s apartment, where we were staying, in the middle of the night and the family was reunited. I realized that night with my mother crying, my father shivering, my aunt consoling, that things had changed and that we would no longer go back to the place that I loved so much, go back to my grandmother. \nSince that time long ago, I realized that my commitment to food and using food to communicate my heritage was partly because I never did say goodbye to my grandmother, my court yard, on that departure. Growing up away from that court yard I understood through time that I wanted to be connected to that place and that time, and food kept me connected. \nMy parents tried to settle In Trieste, but the prospect was bleak, no jobs to be had, so they decided to migrate on. In Trieste there was a refugee camp for political refugees, quite a few were escaping communism to Trieste. It was called San Sabba and now it remains a museum dedicated to the plight of war.  I go to visit Trieste and the camp periodically because we spent two years there as a family, awaiting our turn to migrate on. \nWe lived in the camp, with hundreds of other refugees of all ethnicities. Those two years were tough years, my parents did menial jobs, but food and commodities were hard to come by. The camp life was rather meager, but for me, in retrospect, the experience is such a big part of me, and it gave me so much understanding of who I am, an understanding of humanity. I recall many a time seeing my mother and fathered huddled and crying, not knowing where faith would take us. As a child, not having the security of a home and seeing your parents insecure is a sentiment that stays with you always and makes you a more understanding person. \nI still have a vivid recollection of how we lived as refugees in that camp. The families were settled in the middle floor of the building, while on top were the single young women immigrants, and on the first floor were the single men. Our floor was one big loft separated into vestibules by wooden planks, a vestibule with bunk beds was the living quarters for each family, while the communal mess hall was downstairs. \n\nQ: I was wondering about what kind of food you had. \n\nBastianich: We had big long tables in the mess hall. I remember there was a dirt floor, and we would get in line at mealtime. Everybody had their own little plate, almost like in prison, if you will. We had our own little plate and we went in line as we waited for our food. I remember a lot of meals were spaghetti with tomato sauce, and I do remember a piece of cheese and a fruit at the end. I can't say that I was hungry. I don't recall that. I just recall the sentiments and the settings and the unknown, not knowing what tomorrow will bring or where the journey will take you. Children get taken by the moment, but you can't help but notice that your parents are not at peace. \nWell, anyway, in 1958, Dwight Eisenhower made a provision for refugees that escaped communism to come to America, and we were one of the first families in 1958, and it was  very exciting to come to America. We had no relatives in America; the Catholic community, The Catholic Relief Services, brought us here and helped to settle us. \n\nQ: How did you make contact? \n\nBastianich: Catholic Relief. After World War II, the Vatican had offered to the international community, in the aftermath of the war, to take care of the refugees fleeing communism to Italy.  The Catholic Relief Services got involved with us and others in the camp, helped us with our immigration papers and ultimately paid for our trip and our lodging upon our arrival in the United States. Ultimately, after 3 months they found a job for my father, a small house for us to live in, and we began our life in America. \n\nQ: In one of the books, it said you felt you might be going to Australia. \n\nBastianich: There was an option to go to Australia, but my parents wanted to come to America and had heard there was a possibility that America might open the immigration, and they waited it out. Some people just couldn't stay in the camp any longer and went off to Australia, and many of the people from that camp are in Australia. I'm grateful that my parents waited. I'm sure Australia would have been fine, but I'm grateful to be here in America. \nSo we came to the United States. We came, actually to New York, and we came to Idlewild airport as it was called then. We came with KLM airline; it was so exciting, first time on the plane. I recall landing in Reykjavik in the middle of the night to refuel, the plane we were on was a jet prop.  For my brother and I—he is four years older than I am—the whole trip was truly amazing, just the flying. I remember landing in Reykjavik, it was April, it was still full winter in Iceland. It was dark, but we could see mountains of snow. \nAnd when we landed in New York, to see the big skyscrapers in the distance and land between the small houses, we thought the plane would never fit and we would never make it alive. They had a bus awaiting us at the airport that brought us into New York City—Manhattan—and they put us in the Wolcott Hotel. I think it was on 36 or 38. It was right across from where the Horn and Hardart used to be. We stayed there for about two months while they were looking for an apartment and a job for my father. We would go regularly to visit with the social worker. We had a regular weekly meeting with the social worker at the Catholic Relief; she would guide us, advise us, and give my parents money to feed us. But we didn't have any place to cook in the hotel, so for us it was a little bit awkward, but I remember eating a lot of bananas, bananas were a luxury in Italy at the time so we indulged.  \n\n[End of interview]\n\nInterviewee: Lidia Bastianich \nSession #1 \nInterviewer: Judith Weinraub \nNew York City \nDate: March 24, 2011 \n\n\nQ: This is Judith Weinraub.

So I look at a potato in a different way with this sensibility. When you take the potatoes just out of the earth and you fry it in fresh olive oil just made, those flavors are the pure flavors of food, and me, that is my reference library of flavors. Hence, whenever I cook, I search for those flavors. How can I make the food that I cook match the flavor I remember? \nI also recall playing hide and seek and hiding in the tall hedges of bay leaves and rosemary, and once we were discovered and came out of our hiding place, we smelled like those hedges, I would smell like rosemary for days. \nAs I child I was absorbing all of this, and certainly did not understand then that a passion for food was growing in me. It was not preprogrammed, but I guess for each one of us there is a path, a destiny and if we are lucky enough to identify and follow it for the rest of our lives, we then live a fulfilled, happy, and gratified life. \n\nQ: That's wonderful. \n\nBastianich: Yes. Going to bed was aromatic and fun as well. Grandma had woolen mattresses, made from the sheep’s wool, but in the summertime the mattresses would get washed. We would un-sew them, wash the wool, and stretch it out to dry. To hold us over, Grandma and helpers would make temporary mattresses filled with cornhusks, dried cornhusks, that is. I recall sleeping on those dried cornhusks—the whole night there were strange noises from moving about on those husks, but the best was sleeping in the smell of corn from those corn husks—these are the different memories that I have of food, which remained forever in my mental flavor library. \n\nQ: Who cooked there? \n\nBastianich: It was very simple. It was Grandma and a great-aunt. The courtyard was the epicenter of the family. The younger generation like my mother had moved to the city to work while the elders remained in the court yard. We had a house in the city, but the courtyard was an escape for everybody and a source of food and good nourishment, especially as the new communist regime tightened on people. \n\nQ: This was actually across the border? \n\nBastianich: I was born in Pola—now it’s Pula—which is a city in the Istrian peninsula, which is about forty minutes south from the now Italian border. \n\nQ: But your grandmother's house was on what side of the— \n\nBastianich: It was part of the land that became Yugoslavia. We were caught behind the Iron Curtain. \n\nQ: I see, but nevertheless, it was the country. \n\nBastianich: Yes, where my grandmother lived was in the country outside of Pola. The city was Pola—or Pula now—and the country home was just a little town outside of Pula. That's where I spent my formative years. \nBut due to the unbearable communist situation, in 1956 my mother and father decided that they needed to take their children away to freedom and give them an opportunity for a free life. The new regime, Yugoslavia, would not allow the whole family to leave and go out of the country together; they knew that the family would not return. So my mother, my brother, and I were allowed to go to Italy because on the other side of the border we had relatives, but my father had to remain behind. \nMy father remained as the hostage, but my father did escape. After the month that we were away he did escape, which was the plan between my mother and my father. But we children didn’t know that. He escaped through the border, where they shot at him but thank god he made it and met up with us. I remember he came to my aunt’s apartment, where we were staying, in the middle of the night and the family was reunited. I realized that night with my mother crying, my father shivering, my aunt consoling, that things had changed and that we would no longer go back to the place that I loved so much, go back to my grandmother. \nSince that time long ago, I realized that my commitment to food and using food to communicate my heritage was partly because I never did say goodbye to my grandmother, my court yard, on that departure. Growing up away from that court yard I understood through time that I wanted to be connected to that place and that time, and food kept me connected. \nMy parents tried to settle In Trieste, but the prospect was bleak, no jobs to be had, so they decided to migrate on. In Trieste there was a refugee camp for political refugees, quite a few were escaping communism to Trieste. It was called San Sabba and now it remains a museum dedicated to the plight of war.  I go to visit Trieste and the camp periodically because we spent two years there as a family, awaiting our turn to migrate on. \nWe lived in the camp, with hundreds of other refugees of all ethnicities. Those two years were tough years, my parents did menial jobs, but food and commodities were hard to come by. The camp life was rather meager, but for me, in retrospect, the experience is such a big part of me, and it gave me so much understanding of who I am, an understanding of humanity. I recall many a time seeing my mother and fathered huddled and crying, not knowing where faith would take us. As a child, not having the security of a home and seeing your parents insecure is a sentiment that stays with you always and makes you a more understanding person. \nI still have a vivid recollection of how we lived as refugees in that camp. The families were settled in the middle floor of the building, while on top were the single young women immigrants, and on the first floor were the single men. Our floor was one big loft separated into vestibules by wooden planks, a vestibule with bunk beds was the living quarters for each family, while the communal mess hall was downstairs. \n\nQ: I was wondering about what kind of food you had. \n\nBastianich: We had big long tables in the mess hall. I remember there was a dirt floor, and we would get in line at mealtime. Everybody had their own little plate, almost like in prison, if you will. We had our own little plate and we went in line as we waited for our food. I remember a lot of meals were spaghetti with tomato sauce, and I do remember a piece of cheese and a fruit at the end. I can't say that I was hungry. I don't recall that. I just recall the sentiments and the settings and the unknown, not knowing what tomorrow will bring or where the journey will take you. Children get taken by the moment, but you can't help but notice that your parents are not at peace. \nWell, anyway, in 1958, Dwight Eisenhower made a provision for refugees that escaped communism to come to America, and we were one of the first families in 1958, and it was  very exciting to come to America. We had no relatives in America; the Catholic community, The Catholic Relief Services, brought us here and helped to settle us. \n\nQ: How did you make contact? \n\nBastianich: Catholic Relief. After World War II, the Vatican had offered to the international community, in the aftermath of the war, to take care of the refugees fleeing communism to Italy.  The Catholic Relief Services got involved with us and others in the camp, helped us with our immigration papers and ultimately paid for our trip and our lodging upon our arrival in the United States. Ultimately, after 3 months they found a job for my father, a small house for us to live in, and we began our life in America. \n\nQ: In one of the books, it said you felt you might be going to Australia. \n\nBastianich: There was an option to go to Australia, but my parents wanted to come to America and had heard there was a possibility that America might open the immigration, and they waited it out. Some people just couldn't stay in the camp any longer and went off to Australia, and many of the people from that camp are in Australia. I'm grateful that my parents waited. I'm sure Australia would have been fine, but I'm grateful to be here in America. \nSo we came to the United States. We came, actually to New York, and we came to Idlewild airport as it was called then. We came with KLM airline; it was so exciting, first time on the plane. I recall landing in Reykjavik in the middle of the night to refuel, the plane we were on was a jet prop.  For my brother and I—he is four years older than I am—the whole trip was truly amazing, just the flying. I remember landing in Reykjavik, it was April, it was still full winter in Iceland. It was dark, but we could see mountains of snow. \nAnd when we landed in New York, to see the big skyscrapers in the distance and land between the small houses, we thought the plane would never fit and we would never make it alive. They had a bus awaiting us at the airport that brought us into New York City—Manhattan—and they put us in the Wolcott Hotel. I think it was on 36 or 38. It was right across from where the Horn and Hardart used to be. We stayed there for about two months while they were looking for an apartment and a job for my father. We would go regularly to visit with the social worker. We had a regular weekly meeting with the social worker at the Catholic Relief; she would guide us, advise us, and give my parents money to feed us. But we didn't have any place to cook in the hotel, so for us it was a little bit awkward, but I remember eating a lot of bananas, bananas were a luxury in Italy at the time so we indulged.  \n\n[End of interview]\n","description":"The acclaimed cookbook author, television personality, restaurateur, chef and businesswoman Lidia Bastianich was a little girl when the Catholic Charities rescued her family from a Displaced Persons camp in Italy and brought them to the United States after their native Istria was was absorbed by Yugoslavia and communism.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in Queens, Bastianich originally hoped to become a pediatrician.

Michael Batterberry died of cancer on July 28, 2010 in Manhattan at the age of 78.\r\n\r\nInitially, the couple wrote on the history of art and culture. The switch to food began with On The Town in New York, A History of Restaurants from 1776-1976, and generated two ground-breaking magazines: Food and Wine and Food Arts. Together, they helped change the way people think about food.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1960s, the Batterberrys met and became friends with James Beard and subsequently became frequent dinner guests at each other's homes. Beard particularly liked Michael Batterberry's cooking--so much so that Beard invited him to teach a class as part of his Great Cooks series.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, Michael Batterberry took an active role in educating Americans about problems with the American food system. He was an articulate advocate for small farmers, especially immigrant farmers, and a founding director of Wholesome Wave Foundation, which works to bring fresh, locally grown, affordable food to underserved communities.TTT\n\nInterviewee:  Ariane Batterberry\t\t\t\t\t\t    Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t        New York City\n\nDate:  May 27, 2009\n\nQ:  It’s May 27, 2009.  I’m Judith Weinraub.  I’m with Ariane Batterberry, in the offices of Food Arts magazine.\nThank you for talking to me.  Good afternoon.\n\nBatterberry:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  Could we start by your telling me a little bit about when and where you were born and something about your parents and your childhood?\n\nBatterberry:  I was born on September 18, 1935, in New York City, and was brought up on 67th Street between Madison and Park Avenues.  That means right in the middle of Manhattan.  My parents loved good food, and as I was sort of a late arrival in the family, they’d given up the idea of staying home for me, so I went out with them.  The result was that I was quite acquainted with really great restaurants by the time I was ten or twelve.\n\nQ:  My goodness.\n\nBatterberry:  And I knew what really good food should taste like, not that my mother ever produced any of her own, because she didn’t know how to cook, and our food at home was very, very simple.  But I did know what really great food tasted like by the time I was that age.\n\nQ:  What did your parents do?  What was your father’s occupation?\n\nBatterberry:  My father was a physician and scientist.  He had many patents.  His patents are in biochemistry.  He was the discoverer of procaine penicillin, which is the way in which penicillin can be given in large doses to human beings, so it was a really major breakthrough, which he made in 1946.\n\nQ:  How did they happen to go out to dinner so much?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, they just loved good food.  There were very few, though, really good restaurants in New York.  There were two leaders, which was the Pavillon, which was Henri Soulé’s restaurant, and then there was the Colony, which was the other outstanding restaurant.  In fact, when I was in my teens, I think Sirio Macchioni was the maître at the Colony.\n\nQ:  Would you go out exclusively to fine restaurants or neighborhood restaurants as well?  Not that that particular neighborhood was replete with restaurants.\n\nBatterberry:  You know, there were really three kinds of restaurants in New York in those days.  There were the very fine, which were uniformly French cuisine, and that was what fine or expensive cuisine was considered to be.  Then the second category was the little ethnic restaurant, and there were little ethnic restaurants all over New York, with very simple menus.  For example, the menu in every little French neighborhood restaurant was identical with every other, and there were certain things you always found.  For example, there was always a blanquette de veau.  If you were lucky, here was a duck à l’orange.  You would start with one of—you know, carrottes râté or the various simple hors d’oeuvres, tomato salad, whatever, and usually an artichoke offered to begin with.  Then the desserts ran along.  There was a chocolat mousse, there was a crème caramel, and then if there were departures, that was big news.  Mind you, at the great haute cuisine restaurants, there was much more variety, much more invention, but nothing like the invention we have now.\n\tI remember at the Colony they had a Poire Belle Hélène.  Well, it was the first time I’d ever had chocolate sauce on a pear with ice cream.  I’d had chocolate sauce on ice cream; that you could get in Schrafft’s, which is another category. \n\tAnyway, as I said, there were three categories.  The first was haute cuisine and always French.  The second was the little local ethnic restaurant, very often Italian, but it was always southern Italian.  It was red sauce Italian.  The third was a form of restaurant that exists, that you find much less now, which was the sort of ladies’ tearoom-type restaurant, and into that category I think you could put Schrafft’s, in a way, which was a chain of tearoom-type restaurants.  To my recollection, no wine or spirits were served.  There was a lovely lunch of salads with ice cream or layer cake or something of the sort for dessert.\nFor dinner you’d have rather simple things like a leg of lamb with potatoes.  You might start, believe it or not, with a fruit cup.  I know that may sound horrifying now, but in those days there was always a fruit cup offered as a first course, and a few other things, soup, and you had a choice between perhaps a fruit cup and a soup to begin with.  I always chose the fruit cup, so I’m not an expert on the soups.  Then you would have a main course, which would be a piece of meat with potatoes and vegetables, and then dessert.\nThe desserts were, I feel, in many ways better than they are now in many places, because they tended to be good, old-fashioned American desserts, all kinds of different layer cakes.  You’d have what was called a cottage pudding, which is just a lovely slice of cake with chocolate syrup, but chocolate sauce, and usually pretty good, on top.  That sort of thing.  At Schrafft’s you could have an ice cream cupcake, which was a nice white or yellow cupcake cut in half, with ice cream in the middle and chocolate or butterscotch sauce on the top.  Always butterscotch in those days.  Caramel was unknown here.  That’s the sort of thing.  And those were very simple, as I say, tearoom-style places.  Schrafft’s was the only chain of that sort.\n\nQ:  You went to all these different kinds of places with your family?\n\nBatterberry:  With my parents, it was mostly the very good places.  On the other hand, the tearoom sort of place is where I would go.  My parents rarely went, but it’s where I would go on what used to be called cook’s night out or when something wasn’t going on at home, so I had to eat out.  I had a governess, so I’d eat at one of the tearoom-style places.  When I was a little older, my teens, I went out to lunch with my friends, would be, of course, in the tearoom-type places.  The little ethnic restaurants, they were mostly dinner, and when you were a little more grown up, if you had a boyfriend, that would be definitely where you went.\n\tThis rather simple pattern continued right up until the sixties, and I think what broke it was—and I know Michael [Batterberry] feels the same way—in the sixties, suddenly there was a great deal of interest—I should say before that, there was a growing interest, thanks to people like Julia Child, in better food at home.  So the magazines were getting better, people were expecting better food at home, and as there were less and less domestic servants, you had more and more people who were college graduates who were doing their own cooking.  This wasn’t necessarily what happened earlier.\n\nQ:  Did you have someone cooking at your home?\n\nBatterberry:  When I was a child, yes.\n\nQ:  What kinds of food?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, our cook was black and she was from Norfolk, and it was mostly what you would call southern cooking, and her specialty was fish.  My parents were very fond of her food, but it was simple.  But by the time I was at college, most families didn’t have help.  I was the baby, so when I was the baby off to college, my parents ate much less at home.  They didn’t have at-home dinners so much.  I guess we still did, and that would be into the middle 1950s.  I’m just trying to remember clearly.\nMy grandmother would cook every once in a while.  She was a perfectly terrible cook, but she liked kosher cooking and she would only eat kosher food, for reasons it’s hard to figure out, because she wasn’t at all religious.  So she would do her own cooking, and she’d be cooking away, and she didn’t like Rachel’s food and Rachel didn’t like her food.  They were both cooking away there.  But Grandma mostly cooked for herself, as I remember.\n\nQ:  Did she live with you?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, but we had a big house, so there was room for everybody, but she would cook for herself and she would give me every once in a while a piece of her pot roast, which I loved, but it was so greasy.  As our Mayor Koch said, if you ate that today, it would kill you.  [laughter]\nBut those were the days when really, I should add, the sort of health notions that have become popular currency did not exist.  On the other hand, my father was a scientist, so we ate well in terms of health in our house, and he was a great believer that over a certain age, it was better to have more fish in your diet than red meat.  He was among the first to ever say that, and that was his idea back in the early forties.  So we had fish quite often, prepared by Rachel at home, and we went to fish houses.  That was another thing.  A favorite place of my father’s was something called King of the Sea, which was a big fish house, not inexpensive, but very good.  But there were not a lot of great seafood restaurants either, and that was a whole other category.  We never went out to steak houses because I think my father felt that he himself shouldn’t be eating steak.  I could always order steak and he thought it was fine for me, but not for him.\n\nQ:  Did you get dressed up?\n\nBatterberry:  To go out?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBatterberry:  If I was going out with my parents, yes, I did.  Otherwise, I didn’t, no.\n\nQ:  But was it unusual for a little girl to be with her parents in these restaurants?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, probably it was.  I never noticed because my concentration was totally on the food.  But come to think of it, that’s probably why they took me along, because instead of being a nuisance or difficult to deal with, I was concentrating so totally on the food, that I’m sure I was very well behaved without even bothering to think about it.  A child who concentrates on food is always well behaved in a restaurant.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  What about your schoolmates?  Did they have any experiences like this?\n\nBatterberry:  Not the way I did.  Some of them had people cooking at home; others didn’t.  Actually, some of my best friends had mothers who were terrific cooks.  I have one friend, in fact—you asked now, and I was going to say most not, but I had one friend who loved good food the way I did, and her mother was a wonderful cook.  She and I, we had one or two restaurants that we discovered.  In fact, a little French restaurant.  Now you’re reminding me, and I hadn’t thought about this in years.  But there was a little French restaurant called the Canari d’Or, and Barbara Fox—well, her name now is Barbara Fox, but her name was Barbara Weil then.  Barbara and I would go there for lunch if we could, and it was a little French restaurant.  We went there as early as when we were six or seven years old.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nBatterberry:  We loved the food there, and our mothers would take us or my governess would take us, or whoever, but we could have perfectly well have gone alone, because we knew exactly what we wanted to order and what we wanted to do.  They had a wonderful cheesecake, and I think when we were eight or nine, we got the recipe for the cheesecake and tried to reproduce it at home, but neither of us had any cooking talent whatever, so the result was not brilliant.  But I’ll tell you who did reproduce that cheesecake.  It was white and creamy.  It was not the usual delicatessen cheesecake; it was quite less deep.  It had a graham cracker crust.  And it was much later reproduced exactly, not that they stole the recipe from that restaurant, but Sara Lee, when they first came out with that cheesecake, that was their cheesecake.  But we had the recipe when we were little girls, from this little French restaurant.  So I don’t think Sara Lee stole that particular recipe.  It must have been a specifically French kind of cheesecake.  But I have to say I never found it in France.\n\nQ:  What kind of food did you have at school, growing up?\n\nBatterberry:  School food, which is dietician-chosen school food.  Not good.  [laughs]  But I don’t think anybody—I can’t imagine anybody has any great recollections about school food.  Much later, I went to Cambridge University in the late 1950s, when the food was magnificently terrible, sort of notably terrible.\nI’ll tell you the only place had decent food in my educational history was at Barnard.  I took a degree at Barnard.  Now, Barnard had a cafeteria with quite good food.  That was the best institutional food, and I’m talking about Barnard in the 1950s.  So nobody else is ever going to recall Barnard’s food in the 1950s, so I might as well go on record.  It was really quite good.\n\nQ:  Do you have any idea why?\n\nBatterberry:  I’m sure I know why.  I’m sure the ladies on the board at Barnard insisted on decent food, you know.  It’s interesting.  It was definitely better than Columbia.  I occasionally had lunch across the street.  I preferred Barnard, and I’m sure it had to do with the fact that it was a women’s college.\n\nQ:  When you went abroad to study, did you have any idea that you might cook for yourself or you’d just eat what was available or what?\n\nBatterberry:  I realized early on that I had no talent for cooking.  You know, you have it or you don’t.  My husband loves to cook and he’s so talented, and he can just put anything together and make it taste good.  He has a real genius, and he was recognized by Jim Beard.  Did he tell you that Jim Beard said he was the best cook in America who was not in a professional kitchen?  Which was high, high compliment there.  Needless to say, it’s made our marriage very easy, the fact that I don’t go into the kitchen and compete with him in any way.  But as I realized early on, there was no possibility I was going to be a good cook, number one, and I was a student in those days, I never lived anyplace where you could cook for yourself.  When I was at Cambridge, I was in digs, which was an ice-cold room in the home of a very nice woman who would cook a lovely Sunday lunch for us, knowing we were being starved the rest of the week, which we weren’t, actually.  We filled in with heavy breakfasts and huge teas, which we’d stuff ourselves with, crumpets covered with butter.  It was all not a healthful diet.  [laughs]\n\tAs I said, when I was young, there wasn’t really, in those days, the possibility of cooking for yourself.  When I was at Barnard, I lived at home, and at Cambridge nobody had cooking facilities at all, but you were supposed to have dinner in the hall.  You didn’t need to show up for your classes or the lectures, but you absolutely had to show up for dinner at hall.  I think that was required just to show you were there and hadn’t gone off anyplace.  You were supposed to have lunch in hall as well, so you had lunch and dinner at your college, even if you did nothing else.  They also kept an eye on you.  Of course, for the girls it was totally unnecessary, but I think it was a way of keeping an eye on the boys, to be sure they were sober.  [laughs]  Anyway, for the boys this was much more difficult, you had to be in for both lunch and dinner, stone cold sober.  That was the rule of the university.\n\nQ:  What were you studying?\n\nBatterberry:  Classics, Greek and Latin.\n\nQ:  How long did you stay there?\n\nBatterberry:  I took a degree from Barnard, and because I had an American degree, I was able to have a Cambridge degree after only two years out of three.  So I was at Cambridge for two years and Barnard for three years.\n\nQ:  What made you want to do that, to go to Cambridge?\n\nBatterberry:  I loved Cambridge.  I used to go with my father when he went to meetings at the Faraday Society, so I always wanted to go to Cambridge for postgraduate work, and that’s what I did, although it’s not postgraduate there.  You have to take an undergraduate degree, which turns into a master’s after five years with the payment of five  pounds.\n\nQ:  How unusual.  That’s the way it worked.\n\nBatterberry:  That’s the way it worked.  Exactly.  I think they felt that you couldn’t call yourself a master of anything until you’ve reached a certain age or level of maturity.  Anyway, they figured five years after leaving Cambridge, you’ve been through enough to get a master’s, no matter what you were doing.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  What did you do when you came back to the States?\n\nBatterberry:  I was interested in eating.  I didn’t realize at the time, I felt eating couldn’t really be a career, however interested I was in food.  So I worked very briefly for Random House.  But I want to say one thing which I think will be interesting for all oral histories.  When I came back from Cambridge, I basically had the same education as a Rhodes scholar, a man.  The only jobs I was ever offered were secretarial, and in those days, that’s all you could be.  I think organizations like Time-Life, the most you could be was the fact checker.  That was the top.  The jobs were all secretarial, without exception, and after about a year as a secretary, I figured I could work briefly putting together definitions in a dictionary.  But all these would be gone over by a man who would actually know better.  So the opportunities were very small.\nHowever, it was suggested to me just the year I got back from Cambridge that a publisher wanted a history of art for children, and I thought that was something I really could do very well because my specialty at Cambridge had been classical archeology, which is art history, and I’d taken a lot of art history at Barnard.  I realized that there was a great need, because there was no history of art written specifically for children.  I think a lot of parents wanted their children to know what art was, to be able to go to a museum and not be totally ignorant.  I felt it would have a great market.\nWhen I heard that this publisher was interested, I immediately sat down and wrote a couple of chapters and a proposal.  What happened was, the publisher who wanted it had changed his mind.  He had, in fact, asked somebody else to do it and then it had failed, whatever, and he’d changed his mind.  Meanwhile, I decided that this was a really good idea, and I must have gone to about thirty other publishers over a period of about seven years.  I kept taking this idea around.  During that time, I completed the book.\n\nQ:  That’s amazingly entrepreneurial.\n\nBatterberry:  When you were a woman in those days, you had not much choice.  You either were entrepreneurial or you were a secretary.  I mean, a third possibility didn’t really present itself.  So as I say, I took it around to thirty different publishers over a long period of time and they kept turning me down, but I kept reminding myself that Beatrix Potter was told by thirty different publishers, “Nobody wants a story about a rabbit.”  Well, thirty publishers said to me, “Nobody wants a history of art for children,” and I kept saying, “Oh yes, they do.”\n\tFinally, a wonderful editor, Fabio Cohen, who was then at Pantheon, liked the idea and he published it.  Another interesting fact there, again for somebody else’s history, not necessarily my own, I had a friend who had been at Harvard with other friends of mine, named Carter Brown, at the National Gallery.  Well, I was trying to get plates to illustrate my text, which I could rewrite for different sets of plates, and I went to the Metropolitan Museum, and they were going to charge me something like $300 a plate, and I needed 100 plates for my book, something like that.  Obviously, that was completely prohibitive, so I didn’t know what to do.  I had a publisher, but the publisher didn’t have the money to pay for all these plates.\n\tWell, I went to my friend Carter Brown, who was then just the assistant to the director.  He was my age.  We were both in our early or mid twenties.  He was assistant to the director of the National Gallery and he immediately saw what a good idea it was, and he went to the director and said, “If we illustrate this book, and it’s being published by Pantheon, a very good publisher, if we supply the illustrations, a whole generation of children will be brought up on our works of art and will consider us the country’s leader as a museum.  If it’s illustrated with the Met, then the Met’s works will be better recognized than ours.”  And the director could see that, so they gave me the use of the plates free of charge, which made it possible to not only publish the book, but publish it very reasonably.  I think it was six dollars for a big, beautifully illustrated book.  The equivalent would be quite a bit more now, but it still made it affordable, and they sold hundreds and hundreds of thousands of copies, and it was in every school library and I think it still is.  It went on for thirty years selling very, very well, which is an interesting story all on its own, but that’s a different story from food.\n\nQ:  Were you living at home while you were doing this?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, because in those days, if you were a girl, as opposed to a boy, it was considered perfectly natural to live at home until you were married.  Some girls had their own apartments if they wanted to, but many of my friends were also living at home.\n\nQ:  So you didn’t have to worry about cooking for yourself.\n\nBatterberry:  No.  I never had to worry about cooking for myself, thank goodness.  [laughter]  But if nobody was around cooking, I would just go to a tearoom-type place or someplace small and modest where I’d find a better meal than maybe at home.  But anyway, no, I did a lot of eating out in those days, but not in the very grand restaurants.\nBut the situation, speaking about restaurants in New York, the sort of breakdown I was speaking about earlier continued right up until the sixties, and I think the big change there was because of the movement in the sixties taught respect for doing manual work, and it was suddenly when young people who could go to college chose to do something else perhaps to learn about cabinet making.  You even had, somewhat later, a prince in England who was a cabinet maker.  Anyway, working with your hands became honorable, especially working with the intent of great excellence.  So, doing beautiful handwork.\nIt was at that time that there was much more of a focus on the part of young people on cooking, and it became something that young men were interested in as well as women, and suddenly being a chef, I would say by 1970 it became something that was considered interesting or exciting to do.  The big changeover came in the 1960s.  It came that early.\n\nQ:  Let me just take you back a bit.  Before you got married, how much a part of dating was eating out?\n\nBatterberry:  In those days—I will make another social comment.\n\nQ:  Absolutely.\n\nBatterberry:  Young people did not live together if they were not married, and dating was a very formal affair; i.e., you didn’t just hang around.  You might have a group of friends you hung around with and you’d all go out together, but you didn’t just sort of hang around in each other’s houses either, particularly.  What basically you did was you went out on a date, and that meant you went out to dinner.  And I, being a rather forward-thinking girl or maybe just a forward girl, I very often paid for myself.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nBatterberry:  You could let a young man pay for you, but I always, after a certain point, hated to let anybody spend a lot of money on me.  So I would very often say, “Let’s go dutch.”  In those days, I had quite a number of takers.  [laughter]  In terms of going dutch.  But you did go out, and this is where you’d very often go to the small ethnic restaurants.  They were the perfect dating location.  They were sort of romantic, and the food was adventurous, and they didn’t cost all that much money.  That’s where you’d usually go.  Definitely not to the tearoom-type places.\n\nQ:  When you met Michael, how advanced were you in your writing career?\n\nBatterberry:  I met Michael—we went out quite a while before we were married.  When I met Michael, I really got to know Michael because I’d met him before, but when we, let’s say, started to go out—that would make sense—when we started to go out, I was just about to publish the Pantheon Story of Art for Young People, after seven years of not finding a publisher and then not finding the plates.  I was just about to publish that, yes.  So I was advanced enough to have a book coming out.\n\nQ:  And fairly soon you started to work together.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, and the first thing we did was—I’m sure Michael explained that to you, but we were going to write a history of restaurants, a history of public dining, and there was going to be a third author, which was Hugh Johnson.  Did Michael mention that?  Well, Hugh was in England, and we could have done it now because of communications, but in those days, sending manuscripts back and forth by post, I mean, it was just not practical, and he had other things he was doing.\n\tThen when we got into our research, we found such fascinating information about New York, and we realized that a closer focus just on New York would make a really interesting book.  So that’s when we decided to write our history of dining in New York.  But we never would have done this if we hadn’t both grown up in families where food was very important and attention was given to food, and the people who produced very good food were very much respected, all of that.\n\nQ:  That must have been pretty unusual, to find somebody who shared that kind of background and interest.\n\nBatterberry:  Well, you know, people somehow find people who share their interests.  I mean, that’s perhaps one reason why you start going out with one person and then you go on going out with them, and then somebody else you go out with once or twice and, well, there’s just not that much to talk about, I guess.  So I think that people of shared interest tend to get together.\n\nQ:  When you mentioned Hugh Johnson, you met him when you were at school in England?\n\nBatterberry:  No, but I met him through friends, and his brother had been at Cambridge when I was there, but I met him afterwards.  You know what happens when you’re at a university.  You go on seeing your friends after you’re down from the university, and then you meet other people who were perhaps at your university or somewhere similar.  You know, just groups of young people tend to meet groups of other young people.  I think that was always the case.\n\nQ:  Was it through Hugh Johnson that you met James Beard?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.\n\nQ:  How did that work?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, the thing is this.  Michael and I were going out, and Hugh was a friend of ours.  My memory is not all that clear except that I think what happened—and I don’t know if Michael may remember it more clearly—I think Hugh took us to a cocktail party at Jim’s.  Did Michael—\n\nQ:  I think he said it was a party for a publication of Hugh’s book.  Is that possible?\n\nBatterberry:  I don’t think so.  I don’t think Hugh had a book coming out at that moment, but I could be wrong.  I could be entirely wrong, but I know he took us to a party at Jim’s.\n\nQ:  That was at his townhouse?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, and after that, we went to numerous parties at Jim’s.\n\nQ:  Do you recall any first impressions of him?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, now, that’s a good question.  Hugh had told me a lot about him.  It was really through Hugh that I became aware of him.  I remember realizing when I arrived at Jim’s that there was a whole food world out there.  I guess I always knew there was, but I hadn’t focused on the fact.  I was still in my twenties; Michael had to have been in his early thirties.  But it was sort of a revelation in that way, and what I remember about the party is it was very, very crowded, not full of young people, but by that time I was not expecting every place to be full of young people.  And he had the little plates.  I remember it was charming and delightful.  I didn’t remember Jim himself, because he was a busy host, all that clearly.\n\nQ:  When you say “the little plates,” you mean people made up little plates?\n\nBatterberry:  At his cocktail parties he was a great believer in having little plates so you could put things down on a little plate, as opposed to having to pick it up and put it right in your mouth.  He always had little plates around.  I have a vague recollection that he wasn’t crazy about hors d’oeuvres.  He sort of liked to have a big ham or something you could carve something off of.  Did Michael say that too?\n\nQ:  No, but other people have mentioned that.\n\nBatterberry:  He used to call them “little doots and dots.”  Did Michael tell you that?  He was a large man, and I have a feeling that a little teeny thing that some hostess would hand him just seemed—in proportion to me, for example, I weighed 104 pounds in those days, but they were sort of out of proportion for Jim Beard, who at that point probably weighed twice what I did or considerably more.  So he always had a certain contempt for hors d’oeuvres.  I don’t know.  Am I wrong?  I don’t think he ever included an hors d’oeuvre in any of his cookbooks, but I could be wrong.  Am I wrong?\n\nQ:  I think so.\n\nBatterberry:  I’m wrong.\n\nQ:  Perhaps not calling it that.  That’s another story.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  It wasn’t his sort of thing.\n\nQ:  Were you more sophisticated about the food there than other people may have been?\n\nBatterberry:  No, I doubt that.  I doubt that.  I was more sophisticated about food than most of my contemporaries, but the people there were not my contemporaries by any means, no.  No, not at all.  Not at all.\n\nQ:  You married some years later.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  We were married in 1968, but we wrote the book between 1964 and 1968, On the Town in New York.  At that point we thought if we could write a book together, we could stay together, which we have for another forty-one years.  So that worked.\n\nQ:  That’s pretty good.  At what point did you do socializing in the sense that you might invite Jim Beard to your home?\n\nBatterberry:  Michael and I, when we were married, we moved to Paris and we were there between one and two years, a year and six month or something like that.  I’m not sure exactly.  When we came back to New York, already when we were there we’d give little dinner parties, and when we came back to New York, we almost immediately found an apartment, and we started giving dinner parties even before the apartment was furnished.  I remember having guests and sort of sitting on packing boxes and so on.  I’m trying to think.  I guess when we’d been married a year or two, you see, I think we met Jim when Michael and I were going out, before we were married.  Did Michael mention that?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  So he was somebody we knew by the time we got married.  I guess shortly after we were married and living in our apartment, we started inviting him over for dinner.  That would be about 1970, 1971.\n\nQ:  Would he come by himself or with friends?\n\nBatterberry:  No, we invited him by himself, so he’d come by himself.  Absolutely.  Do you know, he mentioned in one of this articles coming to our house for dinner.  Did you know that?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nBatterberry:  Oh yes, and I have it.\n\nQ:  Do you remember what the article was about?\n\nBatterberry:  I can send it to you.\n\nQ:  It was about some food item?\n\nBatterberry:  Somebody who was going through material about James Beard found it, and I don’t even know when it appeared.  It was an article or it was an interview with Jim, and he said how much he liked our dinners and one reason was that they were very simple, simple and straightforward, with one main dish, really.  I’ll find the article.\nBut, no, he would come by himself.  And the thing about Jim was that he was a foodie and he was very appreciative of anything you gave him that he really liked.  He was very appreciative, but he didn’t want to talk about food.  At dinner, he didn’t want to be necessarily with the foodies.  He liked meeting new people.  He had his interests.  He had a tremendous interest in opera, in the arts.  He was really a great spirit in that way, and he was very interested in politics, mostly liberal politics, I would say, definitely.  He was a real Greenwich Village liberal, and he liked to discuss, as I say, politics, matters of the world, gossip, news, anything but food, really.  He didn’t want to go on talking.  I mean, food was his work, but I think his recreation was to talk about anything else.\n\nQ:  But nevertheless, he was older and larger.\n\nBatterberry:  Much older, much larger, yes.\n\nQ:  Were you at all intimidated by that?\n\nBatterberry:  No.\n\nQ:  You were a fairly sophisticated young woman.\n\nBatterberry:  Well, no.  The fact that he was older, I mean, we had a lot of friends who were older for ages, and we always had a sense of who he would enjoy meeting.  I remember once we had friends in New Orleans who just loved great food, and they were coming for lunch and we invited Jim, and they’d sent up a huge crate of crawfish that arrived before they did, and so Michael had prepared the crawfish for them and we, of course, invited Jim.  I think when something exciting like that was happening, that’s when we would make a point of inviting him, but we invited him quite regularly.  The thing is, he was a great guest because he was so interested in everything else.  So if he was with interesting people, he just was having the best time, and he was a great conversationalist and he had very strong and interesting opinions on many matters.  He was generally a terrific guest.  Yes, we did have to figure out how to give him a big comfortable chair, as I could be perching on a little bed, but we had to have something nice and comfortable for Jim.  But he was a relaxed and interested and interesting guest.  He was kind of an ideal guest, you might almost say.\n\nQ:  What decade would this have been?\n\nBatterberry:  1970s and 1980s, but I think 1970s.  I think when he began to be ill, we perhaps invited him less because we knew he was ill and it was more difficult.  He was sort of in and out of the hospital.  And it wasn’t because we didn’t want to have him, but we might not have—I don’t think he was going out a lot.  I remember several times we went just to visit him, and he’d invite us and we’d just be there with him alone, and that was fine with us.  I don’t know, but at a certain point his health made it more difficult for him to go out for dinners in the evening.  But I do remember once, quite late on, that he took us to dinner.  He loved the—what was it called, the Carriage House?\n\nQ:  The Coach House.\n\nBatterberry:  The Coach House, yes, in the Village.  He took us there a couple of times.\nI have to say this.  I don’t remember him giving a lot of dinner parties, or if he did, they were buffets.  Did other people tell you that?\n\nQ:  I think so, yes.\n\nBatterberry:  I don’t ever remember going to his house for a sit-down dinner.  Mostly they were buffets or dinner or lunch buffets, but I never remember—and there was no placement.  In other words, I never remember sitting next to somebody and thinking, “Oh yes, Jim wanted me to sit next to So-and-so.”  It was, you know, you picked up a plate and you sat down with whoever you wanted to.  I’m trying to remember the format, and basically I think that was it.  I think other people may have mentioned that.\n\nQ:  Let me ask you.  Michael was talking to me about the Good Living business, with the episode with Jim Beard and Prudhomme and Martha Stewart.  Were you a part of that?\n\nBatterberry:  Oh yes.\n\nQ:  You participated in it as well.\n\nBatterberry:  Oh yes, I was there too.\n\nQ:  You were producers as well.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, and I was also in the film.\n\nQ:  What were you doing?\n\nBatterberry:  We were both interviewing.  I didn’t think I was particularly good on television, so I don’t know if I would have stuck with it, but for the pilot I was there as well.\n\nQ:  Were there other occasions where you were with him that they were not either social or that particular production?  I guess you had politics in common.\n\nBatterberry:  With whom?\n\nQ:  With Jim.\n\nBatterberry:  When you say with him, in what terms?\n\nQ:  Did you have any other—\n\nBatterberry:  In the media with him?\n\nQ:  Not necessarily.  I just meant did you see him under other circumstances than either at dinners or with this particular production.\n\nBatterberry:  I’m trying to think.\n\nQ:  Not that there would be any reason for you to.\n\nBatterberry:  Not really.  As I say, I’m trying to think if we did.  Well, you know, Michael taught at his school, so that would be under that situation, and once in a while I would come by and pick Michael up, when other times he’d just come home, but we wouldn’t really be visiting with Jim at that time.  No, I think that’s about it, yes.\n\nQ:  What was involved for you, anyway, the change from your working with art history, going into the food world and eventually to Food and Wine and to Food Arts?\n\nBatterberry:  The thing is this.  We had written our first book.  I had written the Pantheon Story of Art, but that was for children.  Our first book, Michael’s first book and the one we wrote together, was On the Town in New York.  Now, the thing is, there was a big lacuna between when we finished the book and when it was actually published.  We were already finished in 1968, but it wasn’t published until ’74, because, for one reason or another, at that point we had a contract with Random House, but then they didn’t want to publish it, and it was because in the early seventies, New York was not in great condition, so we had to find another publisher.  Meanwhile, we were writing other books.  So the art histories, our art history series, was published actually before On the Town in New York, but On the Town in New York was written before they were.\n\nQ:  That took in the restaurants and nightlife from how far back?\n\nBatterberry:  On the Town in New York was a history from 1776 to really 1976, except it came out in ’74, but we figured really we were bringing it out sort of for the Bicentennial.  In fact, it’s because of the Bicentennial that we did, in fact, in 1974 find a publisher.\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, the thing is, New York was bankrupt, and for people who were selling books, the various publishing houses said, “Oh, nobody wants a book about New York.”  Suddenly, though, the Bicentennial was coming up and something that went back to 1776 was of interest again, I think, to publishers, and that’s why.  One reason, I think it was a good book too, if I may say, but that’s one reason it was taken on by Scribner’s.\n\nQ:  Let’s go back to restaurants just for a second.  So you came back from Cambridge and eventually you got married.  Did you go out to eat much when you were newly married?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, we would have, but we were on—how can I say?  We had lesser income in those days, and Michael loved to cook, so I have to say when we were first married, Michael cooked every night.  We had wonderful food.\n\nQ:  How luxurious.\n\nBatterberry:  Luxurious, yes.  I’ve been blessed all my life.  I’m very spoiled.  I’ve had wonderful people preparing wonderful food for me.  I don’t know under what star I was born.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  When did you start going out to restaurants more frequently?  When you were involved in Food and Wine?\n\nBatterberry:  Obviously as time went on, we went out more and more often, and of course, once we had Food and Wine, that was our business.  Also I should mention that in writing On the Town in New York, we went to a lot, a lot of restaurants for the last few chapters.  Have you seen On the Town in New York?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBatterberry:  Do you have a copy?\n\nQ:  I have the reissue.  I don’t have the original one.\n\nBatterberry:  When you asked when we were first married, although we couldn’t afford a lot, we were very often invited to restaurants because we were writing about them.  So we continued to go to restaurants, and when we could afford, we went on our own, but we were very often invited.  We had great interviews with fascinating people who aren’t with us anymore, so the book is full of that kind of—in a way, it’s its own kind of oral history, that book.\n\nQ:  One of the things I’m interested in is the role that restaurants play in life now, as it’s progressed over time.  You’ve watched that.\n\nBatterberry:  Oh yes.  There’s been a vast growth just in the number of restaurants.  It never ceases to amaze us, and we’re in the industry.  For example, if you walk up Second Avenue or Third Avenue or Lexington, these avenues are covered—every other storefront is a restaurant, and this goes on for a hundred blocks.  I mean, it’s really absolutely amazing, the sheer number of restaurants.  I think New York is a restaurant city because in places like New York or Chicago or any of the big restaurant cities, people don’t cook at home all that much.  In New York City, I think—well, the young people basically spend their money in restaurants.  I think New York Magazine did a study and found there were young people who said they spent up to 80% of their disposable income on restaurants, and they were able to do this because they would live in apartments sort of six in a two-bedroom apartment, or four at the very least in a two-bedroom apartment.  Well, of course they were on top of each other.  Their escape would be to go to a restaurant.\n\nQ:  That must have been really very different from the role that restaurants played in life when you were growing up.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Everybody cooked at home or somebody was cooking for them.  You see, there have been a lot of changes that lead to more restaurant-going.  Number one, when I was a child, it’s still a remnant of the era when there was a lot of help, and families, especially with several children, would have a cook.  That was true of a large swath of the middle class.  I’m not just talking about the very wealthy.  I think that came to an end with the Second World War or within ten years after that, and a whole generation of people who would work as cooks were not replaced by another generation doing that.  Some were black, but many were also immigrants from abroad, Russians, Irish, Polish.  There were people of all color and races who came to this country, especially women who didn’t have a lot of training in other things, who’d become cooks.  Well, that ceased to happen because of women’s education and a whole lot of other social situations.  So the domestic cooks sort of disappeared, I guess in the fifties.  So young women had to do more cooking for themselves.\n\tThere was a period—I like to think of it as the Julia Child period—when women who had a college education had very few opportunities, as I had very few opportunities, who would get married and then they’d be cooking, but they were very serious about trying to be accomplished at cooking.  They were, I would say, affluent enough to go out and buy really good products and really concentrate and take enough time to cook a good meal.  I would say it was the period of my own generation, as I wasn’t typical, as we graduated from college but found very few opportunities in the business world, as during the sixties and seventies the opportunities in the business world were multiplying and it was possible—for example, briefly I went to law school.  I was the only girl in my class.  I was at Columbia Law.  There were two girls.  I wasn’t the only one; there was one other in a class of three hundred.  Well, during the period from 1960 to 1980, that was completely flipped, and by the nineties, there were more girls than there were boys.  So you can just see how that would affect the whole thing of cooking at home.  That sort of thing, that kind of business opportunity suddenly appeared.\n\nQ:  Of course, I never really thought about this, but as women made more money, they could afford to go to restaurants without being on dates.\n\nBatterberry:  Exactly.  That’s just it.  Suddenly you had two-income families or you had women who were on their own, earning a good living, who wanted to go home and cook for themselves—it was just too lonely—who would go out with other girls, in a way, Sex and the City.  But it’s emblematic in the fact, what do they do, this group of girls?  They’re always meeting in restaurants.  You see what I mean?  They weren’t married but they weren’t sitting at home.  Well, that began, as I say, as possibilities for women expanded in the sixties and seventies.\n\nQ:  That’s what I was thinking.  Your book went up to ’76, so since then, that’s been a major, major change.\n\nBatterberry:  And we’d have to write a whole other book about everything that’s happened since then.  In fact, Michael wrote the chapter that brought it more up to date for the more recent publication, but he said to really bring it up to date, you’d have to write a whole other book because there’s been such a vast, vast expansion.  But I think what led to it was really the role of women.  So, as I said, there was just a window between the disappearance of the domestic help and the era in which women had more and more opportunity.  And that window, I think, was the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\tDon’t forget, something I’m very aware of, that a lot of people have forgotten, is that feminism, women’s rights came in in the seventies, not in the sixties.  In the sixties, women were having more and more business opportunities, but not enough for them to really have a movement.  It wasn’t until the seventies there was that movement.  So I think this is what happened.  Looking at the bigger picture, in the sixties you had a development of the feeling that working with your hands and creating something like good food was an honorable, interesting, exciting thing to do, and that affected both men and women.  But women were still in the kitchen, but they were just beginning to come out.\nBut because of this attention to good food, more and more restaurants were opening that produced good food, because there was just a general interest.  It had a lot to do with people like Julia Child and Jim.  That’s where they were important, right there in the sixties and early seventies, this whole movement to good food.  But don’t forget the whole movement to good food wasn’t necessarily a movement to restaurants, because women were still in the kitchen.  But you had this great growth and an interest in good food and the possibility of men becoming chefs, and the idea that if you were a woman in the kitchen, you’re not supposed to be a drudge; you’re supposed to be producing something really great.  All that was the sixties, the sum of attention to excellence in food.\n\tThen what happened in the seventies, like the—how could I say?  The other bookend was suddenly in the seventies, women began to really be making money and having interesting jobs outside of the home.  You began to really have the two-income family, and that really gave a big spurt to restaurants.\nSo it was those two movements, the sixties, general freedom and interest in making food, as it were, and the seventies, where the interest became of major, major importance because women were moving out of the kitchen.\nAnd I’ll tell you something that’s really interesting that I’m sure maybe Michael told you this.  We started Food and Wine in ’78, and we did one of our first demographic studies, but we’d been out for about a year, so we’re talking ’79 or even ’80.  We found that half our readers were men, to begin with.\n\nQ:  Of Food and Wine.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  So that was a big revolution right there.  Everybody said you could never have a magazine for men as well as women for the kitchen, and we did.  Half our readers were men.  The average age of our female reader was forty-two, which was exactly the same as Gourmet, and the average age of our men was something like twenty-eight.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nBatterberry:  Which meant we had an eighteen-year-old for every thirty-eight-year-old.\n\nQ:  That’s really fascinating.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  But that shows you the whole thing.\n\nQ:  New York has obviously been through some tough economic times before right now, and that’s affected restaurants in terms of the kinds of food they were serve and if they would survive.\n\nBatterberry:  Well, you know, the restaurant industry is not doing badly.  I’m sure Michael told you that.  There have been as many openings as ever.  I’m just as behind in going to the new restaurants as I usually am this time of year.  There aren’t that many closings.  There has been a big difference in people ordering less expensive wine.  The check average has gone down, but the seats are just as full.  There have been a lot of—I’m sure Michael mentioned this—a lot of—\n\nQ:  We actually didn’t get into this.\n\nBatterberry:  Well, a lot of prix fixe menus, especially for lunch, under $30 all over the place.  But the restaurants have not gone through a lot of that kind of thing, really.  It’s been a steady growth.  What I was speaking of before, the great influences were always much more important than whether this year the stock market was up or it was down.  In the seventies, it was still growing, even though the city was in trouble.\nThe one big, big thing that affected restaurants that was political and financial was Prohibition.  That was a restaurant killer, and there’s never been anything remotely like that.  I mean, that just closed everything, because they couldn’t make enough money.  So that just killed off a whole generation of restaurants, and nothing vaguely like that has happened since.  Nothing.\n\nQ:  So how do you see this situation developing?\n\nBatterberry:  I think things are fine.\n\nQ:  You think they really are fine.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, and they’re getting better.  I mean, just up in a little restaurant in Rhinebeck, New York, but it’s the hangout, and the owner said he had a bad January, February, and March, and a bad December, January, and early February, but then after Valentine’s Day it all picked up and now it’s great.\n\nQ:  That’s phenomenal.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.\n\nQ:  You will obviously have to write another book that takes us from ’77 on to now.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBatterberry - 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n","description":"Michael and Ariane Batterberry worked together in publishing from the late 1960s until 2010.

This is Judith Weinraub, and I’m sitting with Michael Batterberry, the editor-in-chief and co-publisher of Food Arts magazine, in his office on Park Avenue South in Manhattan.\nGood afternoon.\n\nBatterberry:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  Nice to be with you.  Could we start by your telling me a little something about when and where you were born, and your early experiences of childhood and your parents.\n\nBatterberry:  Right.  Well, I was born in England, of American parents, in 1932, in the north of England, where we spent most of the time, sometimes in London, but as a child, before the war the north of England was mainly my beat, and Scotland.  My parents, as I say, were American.  My father’s business was abroad.  Both of my parents were deeply interested, had a great love of food.\nMy father was from the north Midwest and my mother was from the north South, so they had different outlooks, but they were very copasetic.  Part of this was expressed in forays to find the best of something, kind of foraging trips, which, as a small child, I would sometimes be included in, for example, going to the North Sea with my father to his favorite fisherman on this very slippery wharf, and of course it gets dark very early, and it had a great mystery, with these twinkling ladders and the bobbing boats.  I remember my father bending over and smiling and picking up some boxes of kippers, because this one particular fisherman, he kippered herring better than anybody else, according to my father.  So it was that kind of interest in food that was a sense of love of food.\n\nQ:  Your father was a representative of a company?\n\nBatterberry:  Proctor & Gamble.  Yes, he did various things as a young man with Proctor & Gamble.  They were sort of setting up.  It was an American company taking over something called Thomas Headley, which had been an established similar company, an English equivalent.  But because there was no commercial radio at that time, he had been one of the baby co-founders of soap opera back in the States as an advertising vehicle, so he would go—\n\nQ:  The soap part.  [laughs]\n\nBatterberry:  The soap part.  That was it, because Proctor & Gamble was the first sponsor, so that’s what stuck.  But he realized that if he went to Luxembourg, there was Radio Luxembourg, which was national radio, and you could broadcast commercials.  So you could also beam to England, so, in fact, he got around this by, oh, he hired people like the Ink Spots and Hildegarde, and Morton Downey was a good friend of his.  So my parents sent time on the continent as well, both for pleasure and for business, and I would go along from time to time.\nSo from the time I was really very small, I was going to Belgium and France, etc., and food was always a part of it, whatever children liked, waffles of Belgium or whatever.  But I loved French food, and then, because we were Americans, we went back at least once a year on the ships, on the ocean liners, so you were exposed to—in those days it took, oh, I guess about seven or eight days to cross, particularly in the winter, the North Atlantic.  So depending on the nationality of the ship, you were exposed to even more different kinds of food.  Then my different sets of grandparents in the States represented other kinds of food.  So all different kinds of food, I thought that’s what food was about.  I never thought it was just one way of eating.\n\nQ:  So on these ocean liners, you actually ate in proper liner style?\n\nBatterberry:  Oh, absolutely.  I was always allowed to order whatever I wanted, whether we were on ships or on trains, whatever.  Well, when you’re very small, you know, sometimes I’d have supper in the stateroom, but I always had the full lunch with my parents in the dining saloon, salons.  So that was, again, another exposure, and I loved it.  I never thought of it as being adventurous.  I just liked trying different things because my parents did.  It was an adventure.  There were certain things I didn’t like, like pistachio ice cream, I remember vividly, which they would always try to press on you.  The ships thought the children loved ice cream molds, and it was always vanilla with raspberry and pistachios, which you would eat carefully around.\n\tBut I loved things like the—and I still do, I have this emotional feeling about really good bouillon, and the idea of sitting out on deck and hear the tinkling of the cart with the hot urns of bouillon at eleven o’clock in the morning in these thick mugs.  You’d be wrapped up with a plaid blanket on a deck chair. That was just grand.\n\nQ:  Sounds terrific.\n\nBatterberry:  If you were lucky, you saw a whale from time to time.\n\nQ:  It’s a perfect childhood.  That’s pretty good.  When you were at home, did you eat out?  Did somebody cook?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, these were the days when many people had their cooks, domestic cooks.  We always had a cook until I was about sixteen, I guess, and that was during the Depression, and so—I’m just adding up.  In England there were at least five or six in-staff, in-house.  So I loved being in the kitchen.  Most English families did not let their children go into the kitchen, but that was okay.  So Sarah, the cook, who was a Geordi, as they call people from North Umberland, would invite me into the kitchen, and I would have tea with the cook and our nanny and the maids.  It all sounds very grand, but it was just very cozy.  It was very nice.\n\tThe wonderful thing about an English childhood is that social life begins very young.  You’re expected to behave yourself.  I mean, if you behave yourself, then you’re part of the scene, and say “Good evening” to the guests and so forth and then beat it.  My parents had friends nearby with children my age, and we would go back and forth to each other’s houses for tea, and it was proper tea.  We would sit down and Mrs. Fenwick—there was a family that owned the Fenwick’s department stores—I remember she would officiate at these kiddie teas and it was so much fun.  You were expected to have conversation while the toast was being slathered with Lyles golden syrup and so forth.  We had very watery tea, but the food was good.  I think English food is much maligned, if you ate in people’s houses, which we did.  It was only when you go out to Scotland, which we sometimes did too, Scottish friends, that you had absolutely horrible food for children.  Ew.  I remember fish with bones poached in milk, so it sort of curled out like little atolls of horror.  You would see these lumps of fish sticking out.  The Scotch have their reputation for being thrifty for good reason.  I mean, if you didn’t finish it for supper, the children of the house would find it on their breakfast table the next day.\n\nQ:  Yikes.  So how old were you when you left England?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, we left England as the war was breaking out in ’39, so I was only seven and a half at that point, but, you know, those are your formative years.  I was English.  I had an English accent, which I had to lose, which was kind of knocked out of me by my contemporaries in America.\nSo I had two entirely different kinds of childhood, because when we returned to the States for good, we moved to Cincinnati, and my maternal grandmother was in Kentucky, and I loved staying—my sister and I—I have a sister four years younger.  We would stay with my widowed grandmother in Kentucky from time to time, and it was a time when—I can’t believe it, it was like three centuries before.  At the very back of her garden there was an alley that was like a country lane that was lined with—it was like an allée of poplars.  It was absolutely lovely.  But that’s where deliveries were made, and so the carts would come down, I mean, big, old-fashioned farmers’ carts either with ice for the ice chest or various food, and my grandmother would take me occasionally to the farmer’s market, which was very basic.  All the horses and carriages would be drawn up side by side, and you bought from the farmers’ wagons.  It was a peck of this or a half a peck of that.\n\nQ:  Was it all produce or were the meats and fishes?\n\nBatterberry:  There were meats and fishes, but I think my grandmother was leery of buying meat in an open market.  She was very hygiene-conscious.  I mean, everything was washed, washed afterwards, but it was mainly runner beans and tomatoes and southern things that are essentials.  But you would see this occasional street vendor selling salt-rising bread and some of the other old-fashioned things.  You had wonderful smells.  I don’t know why, the markets always smelled of celery.  Celery seemed to be the pervasive—\n\nQ:  Could be worse.\n\nBatterberry:  But that was the pervasive scent.\nI remember my grandmother saying with—she was very gentle, very soft-spoken, lovely southern lady.  However, her face would freeze if we were going out for lunch someplace, probably a restaurant or café in nature, and she would order chicken salad, and she would put her fork down and say, “There’s veal in this chicken salad.”\n\nQ:  Quite a palate.\n\nBatterberry:  Because in those days veal was a filler.  I mean, no, that was a deception.  It was so much cheaper.  There was something in Cincinnati that my friends who no longer live there, that we would always sort of laugh about, but, in fact, it was quite good, it was called city chicken, and the city chicken was sold generally by the German butchers, of which there were many in Cincinnati, really good ones.  It was a little skewer, a wooden skewer, with cubes, chunky cubes of pork and veal that was rolled lightly in cornmeal, I think, and then this would be sautéed.  So it was a southern kabob.  It was called city chicken.\nCincinnati had not so many things that were specifically Cincinnati, because if it was, it was usually German.  There were excellent German bakers, and sort of German cum southern, with wonderful rolls that you would order in advance for parties and so forth.  There was, of course, Cincinnati chili, which, to the horror of outlanders, was served as a spaghetti, Skyline chili.\n\nQ:  What were they, Cincinnati and Skyline chili?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, Skyline chili was American chili.  There were red beans and ground beef and cumin and chili powder, onions, garlic, etc.  But it always had to—it was like going into a taverna restaurant in Greece, where there’s always a slick of orange grease on top of the pot in the kitchen.  There was always this—it had to.  It was mandatory that there was this kind of floating residue of orange-colored slick—which was, in fact, was very good.  I mean, when you have the raging appetite of a twelve-year-old, you know, that was great.\n\tOysters, I mean even that far inland, were very common, fried oysters and claims and so forth in the restaurants.  Later, when I was about—this is skipping over, because we left Cincinnati when I was about eleven, and we came east to Greenwich, Connecticut, and to New York, and, of course, that did it for me, I mean, New York was it.  Again, my parents—this is during the war—my parents took us to the restaurants that were open then, whether it was French bistros or Chinese or whatever.  We did the works.  So we even expanded our adventures further.\n\nQ:  Your father was still working for Proctor & Gamble?\n\nBatterberry:  No.  My father then became—he was lured away by Madison Avenue.  My father had a reputation.  Numbers of people said that he was—he really was famous on Madison Avenue for being the greatest copy critic there was, and he also hired and fired the agencies for Proctor & Gamble.  Essentially, when he was in New York it was on the advertising side.  He was extremely sociable.  He was a lot of fun, very, very—sort of a volcanic figure and charismatic, which was one of the reasons, of course, that Madison Avenue had wooed him.  But then he discovered, to his dismay, how much borderline deceit [was involved], as he put it—well, he said, “They tell so many lies.”  So he had major jobs at two major agencies and then retreated, because Proctor & Gamble asked him to come back, which he did.\n\nQ:  Where did you live?\n\nBatterberry:  In New York?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBatterberry:  We lived on Park Avenue at 84th Street, so we were just two blocks from 86th Street in Yorkville, which was very dramatic in those days because during the war that’s where, as you know, it really happened, they broke up some Bundt meetings in some of the German restaurants on 86th Street.  It was—what are they called—the Sixth Column, the Fifth Column, Sixth Column, what have you.  But there again, there were all of these—it was a kind of hub of German food.  It was before the Hungarians moved—that was a bit later—moved in, but nevertheless, there were some dinky French restaurants, dinky Chinese, and so forth, but my parents didn’t go there.  We went there with my sister’s nanny, you know, when my parents were out.\nWe had a wonderful African American cook at that point, whose name was Bernice Frye, appropriately.  She was from Kentucky too, and she came with us when we moved to New York, and was a brilliant baker, wonderful meringue pies of all sorts and ethereal biscuits.  We had biscuits six times a week--that was just commonplace—a silver bread basket full of hot biscuits by Bernice.\n\nQ:  So your standards and expectations of food were really pretty high.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, because both of my parents were very critical to her.  They weren’t critical to the point that they spoiled the mood.  They did it evenly, but if it wasn’t what it was meant to be, one of my father’s most repeated expressions was, “You have to get it right.  It has to be right.”  Did they get it right?  No.  Did they get it right?  Yes.\n\tAnd being Madison Avenue, of course, he was a denizen, with his cronies, at places like 21.  I went to 21 the first time “as a man” at the age of, I think, fifteen or sixteen.  My father took me along with Milton Biow, who had the Biow Agency.  Actually, it turns out he was Matthew Broderick’s grandfather, and he was a good friend of my father’s.  We went by Milton’s very elegant offices, and as we stopped and he said, “Bill,” my father, “shake hands with Eddie Cantor,” and there was Eddie Cantor, who had just returned from Israel when Israel had just become Israel.  And the four of us walked over to 21.  I mean, to have your first time at 21, this was perfect, and there we were joined by Abel Green, who was the editor-in-chief of Variety.  So we were given the sort of table that was reserved for the Krindler’s cream, and I didn’t realize it at the time.  I just thought this was “We’re sitting in the dining room instead of the bar.  Why?”\n\tAgain, my father always knew what to order in each of these places.  I think probably his favorite restaurant in New York at that time was The Brussels, which was like being inside a cello.  It was just this beautiful golden wooden-paneled restaurant, with Belgian/French food.  It was the sort of place that had a special drawer for ripening pears for the cheese, and I think it was lined with velvet.  There were these half cups that the pears were turned in until they met perfection.  It was like the stories about the early shahs of Persia--all of them melon fanatics—that’s the national trade—who would be wakened by the melon sniffer in the middle of the night when the melon had reached its absolute perfect moment.  Well, The Brussels was that way about pears.\n\tL’Armorique, which was the first restaurant that I experienced where the chef came out and spoke to—but he kept his toke on, and he was, you know, a big, rough—I mean, not rough, robust, red-faced French chef, and did wonderful lobster à l’Americaine, and that, too, was one of my father’s favorites. \n\tThe first time I ever saw a display kitchen was the Café Chambord, which was on Third Avenue underneath the EL.  The elevated train was still up then.  It was the quintessential bistro with fine bentwood chairs, stereotypical but really good.  The only thing that wasn’t stereotypical was that there was plate glass in one of the walls, through which you saw these immaculate chefs, starched, and these gleaming copper pans, this great batterie de cuisine hanging over their heads, and that was a treat because it was deceptively simple-looking, when, in fact, I believe it was one of the two most expensive restaurants in New York, that and Le Pavillon at that time.\n\nQ:  You were going to school in New York, obviously.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  I went to school in New York at Browning, but I later I used to—how did this happen?  I was in school and I went to boarding school for a year in Newport at St. George’s, and I joined my father then and we—I keep telling you about my father.  My mother was often there, too, and I would do different kinds of things with my mother.  But I would go from prep school to meet him in New York from time to time, and restaurants were always in the mix.\n\tThe thing that was wonderful about my parents’ taste in restaurants was that it didn’t matter what level it was.  It could be the absolute simple, most funky, as long as the food was great.  If they got it right, if it was what it was and it had soul and it had some real distinction, even if it was—well, there weren’t barbecue shacks in New York at that time, there was barbecue out in the Midwest.  And then we’d go to Chinatown.  And I would go to Chinatown with a couple of contemporaries.\nBut then when we went back to Cincinnati—I’m leaping around here.  Well, I was in Cincinnati for about three years in my teens, and I have a circle of dear friends, girls and boys, some of whom I’d known when I was little, and most of them have gone on to—it was a very interesting group.  A couple of them stayed in Cincinnati, but most of them didn’t.  There weren’t that many of us, I think maybe seven or eight was our largest circle, but we started something called—because Gourmet magazine set the standard for good food magazines at that time, and each of our mothers subscribed to Gourmet magazine.  Yes, we started a Gourmet Club.\n\nQ:  And you were teenagers?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  We were about fourteen.  Well, you can imagine what the range in Cincinnati was [unclear] and so forth, there were some good restaurants, but it was mainly clubs that people went to in those days, as many people did in the Midwest and the South, rather than restaurants.  But we would go downtown Cincinnati and sometimes we’d go to the courthouse and watch trials for a while, and then have lunch, and we found a Peruvian little hole in the wall with a certain maté, and we went to Italian and German, of course.  Grammers, which was the great downtown, tiled wall, German restaurant that had Schmierkase on the table when you sat down, and fragrant rye bread that had just been baked hours before, that you’d fall upon.  If you really wanted to commit aesthetic assault, you’d order the limburger sandwich with onions, you know, and then nobody could get near you for the rest of the day.  We boys thought that that was some kind of test of fire.\n\nQ:  What prompted the move to Venezuela?\n\nBatterberry:  My father set up Proctor & Gamble in South America.\n\nQ:  You were about how old at that point?\n\nBatterberry:  I was twenty at that point.  I had started going to art school while I was going to school at the—by the time I was twelve I had been out at the Art Students League of New York, and I was very serious about painting and drawing, and I continued.  They had extremely good teachers at the Art Academy in Cincinnati.  Cincinnati was quite artistic.  They had a good symphony and good art museum and so forth.  I started with Louis Bouché and Albers there.\nWhile I was going to art school one year there, almost full-time, I went to the University of Cincinnati and took special courses.  As a special student, they allowed me to do that, to take literature and Greek drama, etc., play production, where my great friend, whom I just saw last night after a very long time, Douglas Cramer, who went on to be Aaron Spelling’s partner and produced Dynasty and so forth, anyway, we were in play production class together then, and still we always, even with Doug and that circle of friends, we were always checking out where the best beer on draft was, where the best fried shrimp in the basket and so forth.  You just didn’t go and have it; you made it an effort. \n\tSo we went to Venezuela.\n\nQ:  This is the whole family?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  They essentially went to live there fairly permanently, but they kept, obviously, the house in the States.  My father and mother said, “Do you want to come down and spend a couple of months painting?”  At that point I had gone to Carnegie Tech and I was finished with my college days, so I went to Caracas, which he chose as the headquarters, and there was so much to do.  I mean, you were brainwashed in the States.  At that point if you were young and in your teens looking to, “What am I going to do with my life?”  My father would also say that he was supportive of my painting but, “What are you going do to make a living doing this?”\n\tSuddenly, I found in Caracas that if you could do something well, there was a market for you, because there was just so much money.  It was a boom town.  Perez Jimenez was the dictator, and the city was growing, just yeastily.\nMy father, again, as he loved characters and fun and food, he found this Italian restaurant and restaurateur named Tony Grandi, who had had Tony’s Caprice in New York and for various reasons had moved on through—he’d been invited by Trujillo’s daughter to run a club for them in the Dominican Republic that was a disaster.  Then he went to Haiti, and one my favorite restaurant horror stories, Tony Grandi and his soi disant wife, who was a woman older than he, very glamorous, very intelligent, who was sort of selling the last of her emeralds to propel them around the world, they went to something called The Pechoir, which was in Haiti.  It was over above Petionville, and it was the place of choice for the Haitians, for the rich Haitians, to go for this Sunday brunch that looked like the cliché cruise line pictures of those days with these piles of food, tropical this and that, and salads and lobsters and what have you, and the whole thing overseen by a French chef.\nWell, Tony was hired to be the general manager and sort of beef things up, and Giulianna, his consort, had two young Haitian houseboys sort of looking after their bungalow.  The boys were maybe thirteen or fourteen years old.  This French chef was mean, notoriously mean to the staff, and one Sunday all of these dressed-up, dressy Haitians arrived in their cars with their chauffeurs and so forth, and they stood in line in their stiff organdies, and were going down to the buffet table, this mile-long buffet table, and suddenly people were screaming and retching and rushing out.  “God, what is going on here?”  Tony went rushing in, and in between the piles of shrimp and pineapples and so forth was the head of the chef, with his toke on, that had been removed from the rest of him and put, with deep irony, in the middle this display of food.  So the police arrived.\n\nQ:  Haiti was in turmoil.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  So the police arrived and questioned everybody, and it was agreed that the people to whom he’d been the meanest were these two young boys.  So they said, “All right, you come in here.”\nAnd Giulianna, being very Italian and maternal, said, “No, no, no.  These poor garçons.”\n\tAnd they said, “All right, sit down and put your hands on your head and raise your feet from the floor.”\n\tAnd she said, “No, no, La torture, la torture.  No, no.  What are you doing to them?”\nWell, in fact, in Haiti if you put your hands on your head and you raise your feet from the floor, and you tell a lie, you become a sort of quasi zombie.  Your spirit is trapped in there in this maligned falsehood.  So they had to announce that, yes, they had indeed removed the head of the chef.  It was sort of like a Berlitz lesson.  “Did you cut the head of the chef and put it on the table?”  “Yes.”\n\nQ:  Let me back you up.  You were visiting then in Haiti?\n\nBatterberry:  No, no.  I went to Haiti later with Katherine Dunham.\n\nQ:  I see.  This story then—\n\nBatterberry:  This was my introduction to what could happen in the Tropics.\n\nQ:  I see.\n\nBatterberry:  So, needless to say, they left rather abruptly, Tony and Giulianna, and went to Caracas, where he found restaurant space in a building in a kind of—it wasn’t downtown and it wasn’t in the suburbs.  It was half in between, in a hotel owned by an Italian called the Hotel Quasimodo, and Tony immediately set about with Giulianna.  Giulianna was a great designer.  They transformed this place and they made it practically overnight the number one restaurant in Caracas.  Well, Tony needed some money, so my father and some of his friends loaned him some money to sort of keep the cash flow going until he was on his feet.\n\tI got along extremely well.  I had my twenty-first birthday at Tony’s restaurant.  Some friends from the States gave a nice party for me there, and the food was like the crêpes colony.  It was seafood crêpes and excellent Italian food and Italian wine, and fun, so much fun.  The musicians were in a little bandstand in a trio always playing, and everybody loved it.\nBut Tony decided he would expand.  So one night I was invited to join in, being then twenty-one, to hammer through the walls, and we did this in an improvisatory way, to the degree that we found ourselves standing in the back alley.  Anyhow, he went upstairs and expanded the restaurant there, and I did the murals.  This was my first professional brush with a restaurant.\nAnd on the strength of my doing the murals in the new rooms, Giulianna asked me to start a design agency with her, which was an enormously educational experience.  We designed the Alfa Romeo show room and I did the murals there, and we designed furniture, and then I designed jewelry for Cartier because there were all these semi-precious stones flying around for nothing, and then I designed floats for the carnival parades.  So I just found a lot of work, and I made more money than I ever dreamed of making at the age.\nSo that by the time I was twenty-three, one night in my parents’ garden, they were giving a big party and Tony was doing the catering, and he sort of sidled over to me and he said, “I’m going to Europe.  I’m going to Spain and Italy to buy things for the new restaurant.  Why don’t you come with me and stay there.” \tI said, “Why should I do that?”\n\tHe said, “Because you’ve been here two years now, and if you stay here longer, you’re going to end up marrying a Venezuelan and then you’ll never leave here.”\nWell, I thought that was sort of insulting to Venezuela, but nevertheless, I was very tempted because there were so many Italians in Caracas at that time.\nI had a lot of Italian friends and some introductions, so I went, and that was it, and then I moved to Rome.  In Rome I painted and exhibited and wrote.  At one point I was ghostwriting Gloria Swanson’s column for her, because we had become friends.\n\nQ:  Where was her column?\n\nBatterberry:  It was syndicated.  She had it for a couple of years at that point.  She was making a movie called My Son Nero, Il Mio Figlio Neroni, with Alberto Sordi and Vittorio De Sica and Brigitte Bardot.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nBatterberry:  A movie that we don’t see often repeated.  In any case, my education was—I mean, had I not lived in Rome, because in Rome—and I could speak enough Italian because I had spoken Spanish pretty well—you met everybody.  In the winter it turned into a small village.  I always went to Bricktop’s nightclub because Bricktop’s was the best on Via Veneto, and we became friends.  Bricktop had been in Paris in the 1920s.  She was a great friend of the Fitzgeralds, and she taught the Prince of Wales the Charleston and so forth, and “Miss Otis Regrets” was written for her by Cole Porter.  I think I’ve heard “Miss Otis Regrets” more than any human.\n\tAnyway, she had this little nightclub on the Via Veneto that was very twinkly, and everybody went.  The movie stars, the Italians, everybody went, and there was a cabaret.  One night she invited me to a party at her house, her apartment, and she had discovered black-eyed peas were available in Italy, to her joy, and there was ribs and black-eyed peas and salad, and huge glass tumblers full of Jack Daniels, and the piano, and people were playing and singing.  So I was singing, and she said, “Oh, baby, you’ve got to come and sing at Bricktops.”\n\tI said, “No, no, no.”  I’d been in the theater department at Carnegie Tech, but majoring in playwriting and design, but you had to take acting as part of the curriculum.  So I had performed a bit, and I said, “All right.  I’ll come and sing for a weekend.”\n\tShe said, “No, if you don’t sing for two weeks, you’ll never know whether you can do it or not.”\nSo I did it for two weeks, and I was there for fourteen months, and eventually I signed with Leonard Stillman for New Faces.  He came there.\n\nQ:  That’s amazing.  You did sets or—\n\nBatterberry:  I did sets for amateur productions.\n\nQ:  No.  I mean in the nightclub.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  I did.  And “Mack the Knife” was my theme song, and I say with humility that Bobby Darren’s manager stole, not my arrangement, but the tempo.  He heard it.  I sang it in a kind of savage way, in the first person, as if I were “Mack the Knife.”  But then I sang in Spanish and French, and I had a friend who’s a composer who set some Thomas Hardy poems to English folksongs.  It was very, very strange, and I had an Arabic song that was very dramatic with drums and so forth.  Rather than a singer, I’d be called today, you know, a performance artist.\n\nQ:  Oh, how incredible.  Now, you were cooking for yourself or going out to eat?\n\nBatterberry:  Wherever I went, I cooked.  I loved cooking from the time—you know, I loved watching Sarah when I was really little in England, and Bernice used to let me into the kitchen to watch her, and then whatever I did, she would say, “Ain’t that pitiful.”  [laughter]  But I had some rudimentary lessons with her, but I picked it up as we went, and then in Caracas, Giulianna used to come over to my parents’ house, and she was a wonderful hostess and she taught me how to make—she made the best risotto of all time.  The secret was a little bit of brandy at the last.\n\tOh, and what I did with Tony—I forgot this—was Tony was commissioned by the local Taste de Vin Society in Caracas, of the certain Venezuelan grandees, to stage a special meal, a wine pairing dinner with all indigenous foods.  So Tony didn’t have a car.  I did.  So I drove Tony off, and we went into the hinterland and we found trout streams, and we even found a place that sold a tapir, which ended up being cooked, and we found wild fennel and various things.  So that was a real foraging safari, and that dinner was a triumph for Tony.  He was enormously funny, witty, great company.\nI was given the commission, at the age of twenty-two, to remodel a Hotel Waldorf, which was a twenty-four bedroom hotel that had fallen into a state of disrepair.\n\nQ:  In Caracas?\n\nBatterberry:  In Caracas, that had been taken over by the American Club.  They wanted to move into larger quarters.  So I did the out front and designed the bar, including an iron chandelier which I had been unduly influenced by at the St. Regis at the King Cole Bar.  So I thought, “Aha!  I will amaze Caracas by having this created.”  I knew an iron monger, a blacksmith, a Spanish blacksmith, with the leather apron and the bellows and the so forth.  He was one of these figures straight out of Velasquez, and I went to him and said, “Maestro, I really want this,” and I sketched the chandelier, and he made it in iron.  I drew it in feet and he made it in meters, so that caused something of a commotion in the bar, and it was a great feat of engineering to keep it up there over the bar at the American Club.  But Tony did the food, and I did, as I said, the out front and designed the furniture, and that was one my last experiences with Tony in restaurants.\n\nQ:  Did he stay in Rome?\n\nBatterberry:  No, no.  Well, as a matter of fact, he never made it to Rome, because we went to Madrid, where we immediately met all kinds of friends.  It was during the week of San Isidro and we had a great time, and then we went to El Chicote, the great bar in Madrid, and then we went to this wonderful restaurant with friends, the Groghans, and friends of my parents’.  It was the damndest restaurant.  Nobody in Madrid now remembers it, I guess.  I’m of that age.  I was twenty-two.  You ate dinner, and between courses there was a door through which you went, and you found yourself in a balcony over a jai lai court, and “pop, pop, pop,” and you placed your bets and you drank.\n\nQ:  Oh my.\n\nBatterberry:  Vino tinto, vino tinto, and then you went back in for the next course to the relative peace of the restaurant.\nSo we went on to Rome, and we had found in our forays, when he was buying stuff for the new restaurant in Caracas, which was really huge, there was some very inexpensive terrific pigskin luggage, and everything in Spain was cheap in those days.  We each, we said, “Can you believe these prices?”  So we each bought this sort of matched set—it was absurd—for very little.  So we arrived at the Rome airport and Giulianna’s son, who was a doctor, had come to greet us, his soi disant son-in-law, and suddenly some plain-clothed policeman came and took Tony into a side chamber, and I heard these yells and shouts in Italian.\n\nQ:  Oh dear.\n\nBatterberry:  In Capri, where he had met Giulianna, he had owned a nightclub restaurant, which was very well known, called Numero Due, and one night someone had come in drunk and Tony asked him to leave, and he took a swing at Tony, and Tony knocked him down, and it turned out he was a policeman.  So Tony’s name had been on the books all this time.  So he was escorted out of the country and he had to go to Switzerland.  Then I went up to Switzerland to see what on earth was going on, and met him with his parents.  He was originally from Lake Como.  And that was the last time I really ever saw him.\n\nQ:  And you went back to Rome at that point?\n\nBatterberry:  I went back to Rome.  Well, I had just arrived in Rome, because I went with his son-in-law into Rome and proceeded to have a different life there.  At first I lived alone.  They had wonderful pensiones, and this was during the height of the Dolce Vita, and then I made friends, and I shared an apartment with two Italian friends, right over between Trevi Fountain and the Quirinale, and on the top floor of the palazzo, which was absolutely great.  There was a Neapolitan pizzeria, and you could let down a basket, because it was on the fourth floor, and they’d put the pizza in and we’d put the money in.\n\tThen I shared an apartment with a friend who became one of my closest friends in life.  We were each other’s best men at our weddings, Francesco Ghedini, who was a journalist from Bologna, who knew an—well, if your Bolognese, you know about food, and he knew an enormous amount about food.  I had dear friends my own age, mainly Italian, and the Italian habit was of the men and women, young women, would get together, oh, at least four or five times a week.  So, okay, “Dove andiamo sta stasera?”  “Where are we going tonight, which trattoria?”  And then started arguing about which trattoria.  “No, no, no.  This one is the best because the tortellini there.”  “No, no, no.”  So you have another drink, and then you have this absurd conversation.  It was always the same, and quite frequently you’d be going on so long, you got there, they would have put the chairs on top of the table.\nIn those days it was kind of topsy turvy.  Chicken was the most expensive thing on the menu, and pollo a diavolo was one of the specials, and pigeon, grilled pigeon and so forth.  I had another wonderful experience, a meal that I’ve written about, in that I met Eugene Walter, who was a wonderful character, who was a poet and later a great food writer.  He wrote the Time Life book on southern food, and he was the editor of Botteghe Oscure, the literary review.  He was from Mobile, Alabama, and he was one of the founders of Paris Review, one of the founding editors, and he was going to interview Baroness Blixen, Isak Dinesen, who was coming to Rome.  I had done a series of paintings that were rather eerie in a way, sort of sinister, in the mood of the Seven Gothic tales, and he said, “You’ve got to show these to Baroness Blixen.”\n\tI said, “I can’t believe this.”\n\tAnd he said, “Why don’t you do her portrait for my interview for the Paris Review, for the Art of Fiction series.”  So we went to meet Baroness Blixen, who was a formidable figure [wearing a deep cloche, so] you could barely see her in profile, and she wheeled at me, and she said, “Are you going to do my portrait?”\n\tAnd I said, “I’d like to very much.”\n\tAnd she said, “Then you better sit over there where you can see me.”\nSo she invited me to lunch the next day, and there was a French woman who was a lion hunter, a literary lion hunter, who thought that she had Baroness Blixen all to herself, ha, ha.  Well, she had a little Fiat, and I will never forget this poor woman’s face when Baroness Blixen introduced me and said, “This is my new friend, Michael Batterberry, and I have invited him to join us for lunch,” knowing full well that this poor French woman was going to pay for it, and so the three of us bounced off in a car to the Via Appia Antica, where the Baroness Blixen had heard about a restaurant where they did this spectacular—she didn’t talk about food that much because she was anorectic, but she knew food absolutely, if you read her various letters and diaries as well as her stories.\n\tThere was this place.  It was called La Cisterna, I think.  In any case, it was so beautiful.  It was overlooking a field of ruins out at the Old Appian Way, and we sat on this terrace under roses the size of baby’s heads, bobbing above us.  It was in May. The waiters came rushing forward like centurions, because she was one of those presences you didn’t have to know who she was, you knew she was, and she said, “We would like the chicken.”  And the chicken was—well, essentially three or four of these waiters in their brilliantined black hair and those snappy white jackets came with these branches of freshly torn laurel, bay leaves, big branches of them, and they crossed them like swords.  And another one took cheap brandy, Italian brandy, poured it all over the leaves and set it on fire so there was this great gust of smoke and perfume, and they held seven, eight cooked chickens on long prongs over this smoke of the burning laurel leaves.  And so she sat in the middle of it like the oracle of Delphi, you know, with the smoke curling around the end of her cigarettes, and that was probably of all the wonderful meals I had in Rome the most memorable.\n\nQ:  I can see why.  How long did you stay there?\n\nBatterberry:  Where?\n\nQ:  In Rome.\n\nBatterberry:  In Rome?  I was there for several years.  I don’t know, there was a kind of dribbling exodus of different friends.  You know, you sort of sensed that an era was coming to an end.  My parents, particularly my mother, said she found it extremely irritating when her good English friends would say, “Well, darling, because you’re not like an American.”  Whatever that meant.  I found many of my Italians saying to me, “No si come un americano,” you’re not like them, precisely word for word, I mean, in a different language.  And I wondered, I thought, “You know, all right, what am I?”  I’m not English anymore.  I’m certainly an American more than anything, but I was losing that.\n\tSo I decided, when Leonard Stillman asked me to be in New Faces, I thought, “Okay.  This is it.  This is the call.”  I was never in it because he never got the money together in time, and by that time I saw what show business was like in this country.  It was quite different from Italy.  So I moved on.\n\nQ:  You mean from show business?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  Well, later on I—no, not completely.  I co-produced and directed a musical review off Broadway, in which the unknown, completely unknown, Linda Lavin was in, and Barry Dennen, and we were struck by equity, equity was striking everybody, this is just not meant to be.  Why am I even thinking about this?\n\nQ:  When you came to New York, how did you think you were going to make a living?\n\nBatterberry:  Painting.  Painting.  Writing.  I did numbers of things.  Actually, one of the things I did was I did a few illustrations for Gourmet.  I did special windows for Gene Moore at Bonwit Teller’s once a year they sealed off the windows to refurbish them, and behind, and so I would paint what was on the glass, different things.  I did this review, etc.  Then Ariane and I met, and—\n\nQ:  Tell me where you met.\n\nBatterberry:  We met at the St. Regis Roof at a party that had been organized by a Croatian friend of ours, who was the baby chief designer for Cassini.  She was a fashion designer, and she had this club that she called the Renaissance Club, and the idea was she would get young people who were creative, and—well, what we were meant to do, I’m not quite sure, but nevertheless, having a black-tie dinner dance was one of them.  Dance actually, with a little bit of food.  Ariane and I met, but we were each with another date at that point, and then we were brought together by another mutual friend and we became friends first.\n\tAriane had gone to Cambridge, she’s from New York, but Ariane had gone—after Barnard she went to Cambridge, and had loved England and stayed there for a while.  One of her friends was Hugh Johnson, and his first book, his first wine book had come out, and we went to a party for Hugh at Jim Beard’s house.\n\nQ:  Now, at that point were you married?\n\nBatterberry:  No.  No, no, no, we were just friends.  Again, in a circle of friends, my sister included—\n\nQ:  And the party was for Hugh Johnson?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, the one at Jim Beard’s was.  Yes, it was for his book.  It was for Simon & Schuster.  It was for the book launch of wine, his first book on wine, and that’s when we first met Jim Beard.  Obviously, I knew all about him.  Again, my parents had a couple of his books and so forth.  I think my father had even tried at some point, toyed with the idea of trying to get him to—my father had done something with Duncan Hines that got Duncan Hines involved & Proctor and Gamble, and he thought maybe James Beard would—but that didn’t pan out.\n\tSo we met Jim, and then Ariane and Hugh Johnson and I decided that we would write a book together on the history of restaurants.  We were that young.  It was preposterous, you know, what an undertaking.  So Ariane and I would do it in the States, and Hugh would go back to England and do his part there, in theory.  Then we began looking around, and we found an extraordinary collection that nobody had ever gone through in the New York Historical Society.  We thought, “Well, nobody has really done a social history of eating and drinking in New York, the history of New York seen through eating and drinking.  Why don’t we do that.” \nAriane had already published two books with Pantheon at that point.  One was a history of art for school ages that she did with her friend Carter Brown before he became the director.  He was low man on the totem pole with Mr. Walker, and he supplied her with the plates from the National Gallery, which made it affordable for schools, and then she wrote a biography of Beaumarche, which was also published by Pantheon.  So they loved her at Pantheon, and they said, “Fine.  Sure.  Do a book,” to the two of us.\n\nQ:  So she was an established writer?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  And I had never written a book.  I had written numbers of articles for various things, but it was on the strength of her relationship with Pantheon that we got a contract with Fabio Cohen, who was a very good editor there.  By the time we finished the book, New York was in the basement, and the sales department said, “Well, nobody is going to buy a book about New York,” that was it.\n\nQ:  What year was this?\n\nBatterberry:  We married in ’68, so we must have started it in late ’65.  We worked a couple years on it, and then we were sort of dashed, to put it mildly.  They said, “It’s a nice manuscript, but the sales department won’t do anything about it.”  So we figured, look, we’d written a book together, and realized we loved each other, so we got married.\n\nQ:  Reasonable.\n\nBatterberry:  Reasonable.  And we were offered a contract by McGraw Hill.  The initial one was to edit with summary writing, a ten-volume history of art, and once we got into it, we realized it was so full of errors that we had to write from scratch.  So that was something that occupied us for several years.\n\nQ:  And these were big books or medium-sized or what?\n\nBatterberry:  Again, sort of junior college level, kind of survey books.  I’m trying to think how many words they were, each one.\n\nQ:  Because you did a lot of them.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  I can show you one next time.  And then we did ten, and then four of them came out in paperback.\n\nQ:  Yes.  What I’m looking at here it says, Roman Art, Greek and Roman Art, High Renaissance, Chinese and Oriental, Children’s Homage to Picasso.\n\nBatterberry:  That was another thing, that was for Harry Abrams.\n\nQ:  I see.  What happened to On the Town in New York?\n\nBatterberry:  On the Town in New York, it took us another couple of years to find a publisher after that, and Burroughs Mitchell, who was the editor-in-chief of Scribner’s, was a New York buff, and he took it on.  So that’s how it finally came to light in 1973.\n\nQ:  Now, meanwhile had you kept up with Jim Beard at all?  Or how did that work?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.\n\nQ:  You met him first at that party, you taught a class for him later on, so you must have in some way or other—\n\nBatterberry:  We met again socially, and he invited us for a meal at his house and we had such a good time, because, you know, Jim was interested in so many different things.  He was interested in Ariane and me in different ways, because Ariane for her knowledge of—Ariane has her master’s in classics.  And he liked artists.  He liked the idea that I was a painter as well as a writer at that point, because he had several painter friends, and one of them was a woman by the name of Antoinette Schulte, who painted the portrait of him that’s over the mantelpiece in the Beard House, who was an American expatriate in Paris, and she had finally moved.  She was Jim’s age.  She moved back to New York.  They were close.\n\tIn any case, so we invited him, you know, we reciprocated, and suddenly this friendship started, and he liked the way I cooked to the degree that—I think he may have done it intentionally just to infuriate Jane Montant at Gourmet—he said that I was the best cook outside of a professional kitchen in the country.\n\nQ:  That’s pretty good.  To whom did he say that?\n\nBatterberry:  He said it to several people, and he said it to Jane Montant; she was the editor of Gourmet.\n\nQ:  So you were cooking rather than Ariane?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  Ariane doesn’t cook.  It works out very well.  Ariane knows food very well and appreciates food, so I cook for Ariane.\n\nQ:  It’s pretty good.\n\nBatterberry:  And cook for friends.  Not so much anymore, unfortunately.\n\nQ:  Tell me what he liked about your cooking.\n\nBatterberry:  A couple of things.  The fact that, I mean, now it’s so commonplace, but that I mixed cuisines without confusion.  For example, if I did a bollito misto I might even have a Chinese black bean sauce with it as well, some things that really worked.  Actually, I have something that they sent me from the Beard House, which was an interview—do you have those—in which he speaks about people—he hated when people said, “Oh, I could never cook for you.”\n\nQ:  No, I don’t know that.\n\nBatterberry:  I can give you a copy of that.  He cited us as an example of the sort of dinner that he liked, because it wasn’t too fussy and there weren’t too many things and it was interesting and so forth.  And he said, “My good friends, the Batterberrys,” and this was a long time ago.  It was an interview, I don’t know, they found on tape or whatever, but they transcribed it.  Because I know we were good friends by 1973, because that’s when On the Town in New York finally came out.\nWe had met an extremely bright young, young woman, who was PR and marketing for Bloomingdale’s, and we met her at some charity event, and we fell to talking about—she asked what we were doing, and we said, “Well, we have this book that’s coming out.”\n\tAnd she said, “Oh, Bloomingdale’s has got to give the launch party.”\n\tSo we said, “Fine.”\n\nQ:  Nice big space.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, indeed.  And Bloomingdale’s was sort of the place to have a party.  It was, looking back, rather bizarre, but it was on, I guess, the top floor, the floor with the bookshop in it as well.  It was the first party to have food stations with a lot of different restaurants.  Jim Beard came; Mayor Lindsay came; Bricktop was in town; Geoffrey Holder; [unclear].  Geoffrey is another old, dear friend of mine; we’re cooking friends.  And the Four Seasons—you can imagine what the economy was like in those days.  Laura Maioglio from Barbetta brought not only a string quartet in eighteenth century costume, but fonduta and white truffles for four hundred people.\n\nQ:  My goodness.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  Not today would this happen.  And, oh, the smell of white truffles by the escalator was really something.\n\nQ:  So the party was for about four hundred people?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, and a terrific New York mix, and we got a lot of press because of this restaurant element. It was crazy. The Persian Room. Luchow’s came and they brought their oompah band, and had sausages and sauerkraut.\n\nQ:  Who asked these different restaurants to come?\n\nBatterberry:  Bloomingdale’s did.  I don’t know if they sent a sheet out on the book.  I’m sure they did, and, of course, we knew some of them because they were in the book.  We’d interviewed Andy Anspach of the Algonquin and so forth, and certainly the Four Seasons.  We knew them.  But people were turned on by the idea of doing something like that at Bloomingdale’s.  So we were extremely fortunate.  And on the strength of that, the party was such a success that Bloomingdale’s asked us to write the Bloomingdale’s Book of Entertaining for our sins—not a totally happy experience—that we did with Random House, and we packaged the book.\n\nQ:  It was like a coffee table book?\n\nBatterberry:  No.  It was a useful book.  They had recipes in it as well, and the photographs—Peggy Healy was the name of this very bright young woman, and now is a very bright somewhat older woman, who’s come back into our lives recently after many, many years.  She said, “You pick the people, people who have some character.”  And so Jim Beard was one of them, and Geoffrey Holder, our pals, Gael Greene, and then other friends of ours, more sort of social friends—lower case S—and so we did it.\n\nQ:  This was for the party for the Bloomingdale’s book?\n\nBatterberry:  They gave another party at Bloomingdale’s for the launch of it when it finally came out, and Jim Beard was there, and they set up each of the hosts in the book, there was a chapter, very short chapter on each one of them.  They were asked to design a big tabletop in their taste using themes from the store and themes of their own.\n\nQ:  And had you established Batterberry Associates at that point?\n\nBatterberry:  No.  That’s ’73.  Then we continued writing.  To go back, the thing about On the Town in New York was when it came out, overnight it put us in the food mafia, which was very small at that time.\n\nQ:  So who would it have been, more or less?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, there were two, but Jim Beard, he was our big daddy.  His circle was Helen McCully, Sam Aaron.  Let me see who else specifically.  And then Craig Claiborne gave us a review saying it was the best book ever written on the subject.  But we didn’t become friends with Craig for many years, because we felt out of loyalty to Jim, because there was a kind of unspoken antagonism between the two, and people said, “Well, you’re in one camp or the other.”\n\nQ:  Do you have any idea what that was about?\n\nBatterberry:  It was competitiveness, I think.  Territorial and “I was here first.”\n\nQ:  So after the book, then, what was your next project?  Then you did the Bloomingdale's book, and then what?\n\nBatterberry:  The Bloomingdale's book came out in ’76, and then also in ’76 we did a book with the Whitney Museum for the Bicentennial, on the history of American art for young people, and that was Pantheon, again, Ariane’s original publisher.\nThen our friend Massimo Vignelli called us and said, “Do you want to do a book on the history of fashion with me?  I’ll design it.  There’s a book packager called Chanticleer, Paul Steiner, and he liked your New York book.”\n\tOh, I forgot to mention, yes, we were the arts editors of Harper’s Bazaar, contributing, and when the New York book came out, it really changed our lives a lot.  That’s really what put us in the food trajectory in terms of publishing, because over at Hearst, at Harper’s Bazaar, they said, “Oh, we didn’t know you did food.  We just thought you did art.”  So they asked to do some food pieces for them, you know, about restaurants, who went where, and, you know—\n\nQ:  For some of their magazines?\n\nBatterberry:  For Harper’s Bazaar.\n\nQ:  For Harper’s Bazaar itself.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  We later wrote for Connoisseur and Travel and Leisure and a number of magazines, New York Magazine.\n\nQ:  And then when was the Good Living series that you did the pilot for?\n\nBatterberry:  That was not until after American Express went through the first phase of buying Food and Wine.  So that would have been in the early eighties.\n\nQ:  Later, then.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.\n\nQ:  What about the teletext project for Time Inc?\n\nBatterberry:  That was also the early eighties.\n\nQ:  That was in the early eighties.  So, I guess now then we need to get to Food and Wine.  How did that—\n\nBatterberry:  We met a couple named Robert and Caroline Kenyon, who were the reps for The Economist.  They were publisher’s reps.  They were very, very skilled, very high-styled ad representatives.  He was English.  She was American.  Their son is Sandy Kenyon, who’s on television now.  Charming young man.  And we were told by a mutual friend that they thought it was time for a modern food magazine, and we had been expressing the same idea.\n\nQ:  This was when?\n\nBatterberry:  Early seventies.  Because it took us together six years at least, almost seven years, to raise the money for Food and Wine.  So we came together, and having discussed, I expressed what I thought a food magazine should be.  I say I because I’m more the food person than Ariane.  Ariane had more the cultural view of it.  Together they said, “Oh, that sounds right on.”\n\nQ:  Now, what was that idea?\n\nBatterberry:  The idea, number one, was there was evidence that a lot of gender taboos were being shattered in terms of a woman is in the kitchen, a man is at the grill outdoors, etc., etc., and at that point a lot of numbers of young men were going off to college with woks.  You know, stir-fry was coming in at that point and so forth, just as girls were slamming the door like Nora in Doll’s House on the kitchen, because of the stigma of its being almost like a slavery.\n\tIn any case, we thought there should be a magazine.  We did not use the word, ever, unisex, but it should appeal equally to women and men, that it should appeal to younger people as well as older people, that you didn’t have to wait to become interested and express your interest in food.\n\nQ:  And young meant—\n\nBatterberry:  In their twenties.  This was all theoretic, that every good writer, no matter what, has a good food story in him or her, and that we would get writers of a certain stature involved, and a quirky art approach, something distinctive and modern without being trendoid.  So we had this idea, and a number of people got it, but never enough to put up the money.  We took it around, and we really had a dog-and-pony show for various potential investors, including the Swiss, who finally said, “Oh, but Americans, in the long run, they only like hamburgers.”  We heard that more than once.\nSo that took a long while, but at a certain point we said, “All right.  Now, we have to have some evidence before go to more potential investors, that there is an audience.”  So we raised another $100,000 to do a test mailing.  We rented lists that we felt were appropriate, and we went to Bill Jamey, who was a man who created mailing pieces, promotional mailing pieces for Time, Inc. and Time Life and so forth, and he was the sort of the one of choice.  There was another man, whose name I can find out—I’ve forgotten it now—who had what was the forerunner of a computerized printout of the potential of the magazine.  You fed the numbers into it.  He was much sought after because he owned it outright.  Anyway, the rule of thumb then in publishing, magazine publishing, was that if you had a 2 to a 2 and a half percent return, you really had something solid.\n\nQ:  From the initial mailing?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  You could move ahead with that.  So we got together with Bill Jamey and we said just the sort of things I’ve been saying, and the kind of stories that we envisioned.  You know, there would be a gardening column as well as a vegetable garden with Thalassa Crusoe, who had a TV program at that point.  Jim Beard, of course, was in the mix.  He said, “Fine.  Use my name,” etc.  He was all behind us.\n\nQ:  What kind of stories did you envision that were food-related?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, along with Jim Beard was tapas, if you can imagine.  There was one on soufflés, and we had pictures of Jacques Pépin.  That was in the dummy.  We used our art background, too, to get plates from the folk art museum and so forth.  We wanted to do history, design, gifts, techniques.  What we had done for the Bloomingdale's Book of Entertaining was we had broken things down into a scale of three, being the simplest and cheapest, the mid range, and go for broke.  You know, those complex recipes—\n\nQ:  Your vision of this magazine?\n\nBatterberry:  We did this for the Bloomingdale's Book of Entertaining so this is the most essential equipment that you had to have and tabletop.  And then mid range, and then the fantasy stuff.  So we took that same approach to techniques.  So if it was pâtés and tureens, you had the simplest pâté possible, and then through the most complex hobbyist tureen for the weekend, you know, you could spend a day and a half making it.  And we applied that to other areas, such as tabletop and gifts.  Of course we had drinks.  You had to have drinks because of the liquor advertisers.\nAnyway, we tested it, and we got over 5 percent back.  People were just dumbfounded.  They still didn’t give us the money.  “Well, yes,” they said, “I can see how this—yes,” blah, blah.  It was draining at that point.\nThen we met someone who was connected to Working Woman magazine, which was a new magazine then.  He had other connections, and one of them was with Playboy and Hefner, and Hugh Hefner had initiated a new program at Playboy, a new magazine division in which he would put up match dollars for new publications that he thought could make it, and that there would be a buy-out clause at a certain point down the line, six or seven years, whatever, then it would become the Playboy property.  So we said, “Why not?”  Well, he got the idea that young men would be interested in this.  He’s very smart and very nice, a very nice guy.\nSo we flew out to California and spent a day at the mansion with—oh, no, more than a day.  We were in the Playboy guest house, and Christie, his daughter, had just graduated from college, so bright, and so—I hate to say it, meant for better things, but she was teaching Shakespeare to kids in ghettos and so forth.  She was really a remarkable young woman.\nAnyway, we got together, and he said yes.  And the thing about Hugh Hefner is, my take is he’s truly only interested in editorial.  He’s a real editor.  And so he enjoyed very much being taken through the dummy and discussing that, and so part of the deal, as we had never run a magazine, he gave us a sort of guru, a resident guru by the name of Mort Persky, who was a seasoned newspaper and magazine veteran, delightful guy.  Delightful.  From South Carolina.  I remember one of the great lessons he taught me, and I spent weeks with him, day after day, but he said—\n\nQ:  Where?\n\nBatterberry:  In New York.  First we met in California, but then in New York in the Playboy offices, just going over, talking out, talking out, talking out, and they said, “Well, you can’t have two editors-in-chief.  Nobody ever does that.”  So I was made the editor-in-chief and Ariane was executive editor.\nSo we spent a lot of time with Mort, and we were talking about typography and typography design.  He said in this warm southern accent, he said, “Just remember,” he said, “I remember there was an article about fire, and the designer spelled out the word ‘fire in logs.’”  He said, “Don’t ever spell ‘fire in logs.’”  [laughter]  It spoke volumes, I must say, but he was full of—it was like having a tutor, a resident tutor.  He kind of shepherded us through the Playboy politics, which was an enormous help, and we actually planned the first issues in the Playboy offices, because we didn’t have our permanent offices at that point, and it was such a wonderful period.\nThen when it was signed, we could go out and say to people, “Okay, now we’re doing it right,” or do whatever.  In the first issue, Wilfred Sheed did a story, and then we got George.  I went over to George’s, to Plimpton’s, and George agreed to do a series called Memorable Meals, which would be historically oriented stories.  His assistant did most of the research and then he would do the writing.  For example, the first one was the meal that was found on the ghost ship Marie Celeste, and then he did an absolutely marvelous one about if the pilgrims invited the Indians for Thanksgiving to New York City in 1978, how much would it cost?  So they found out how much it would cost to dig a barbecue pit in Central Park and do the clambake, and then there were 126 tickets to Ain’t Misbehavin’ and whatever.  [laughter]  It was great.\n\nQ:  When did the magazine actually start?\n\nBatterberry:  The first issue was April 1978, but there were other stories, in that part of the deal was that there would be an insert in Playboy—this was Playboy’s deal—to “introduce the magazine,” in quotes, and Jim was in that, Jim Beard.\n\nQ:  How so?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, there was a story about him.  We had photographed him.  Dan went and photographed him, and it was about tapas.\nIn that same issue there was a major feature on sex toys.  It was not appropriate to have Food and Wine introduced with these sex gadgets.  And I must say, my mother was rather surprised.  [laughter]  She was not passing them out heatedly to friends.\n\nQ:  It would be noticeable.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, but what was really noticeable to us was they said, “Oh, of course you’ll have this insert.” They charged us.  They deducted from their investment full-page rate, ad page rate, for the twenty-odd pages of this insert, hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Anyway, so there went our bottom line.\n\nQ:  Spending money.\n\nBatterberry:  Spending money.  Anyway, but we had a launch.  The Kenyons organized a launch for potential advertisers at the Four Seasons restaurant, and the bell sounded for the party to begin, and there were no magazines.  There were dummies of Food and Wine that would be passed out.  Well, it turned out there had been a heist, because there are magazine thieves and they thought they were raiding a Playboy truck and they were getting Playboys, when, in fact, they were getting dummies of Food and Wine, and at the last minute they were found abandoned in some warehouse, I think, a garage in Brooklyn, so some of them were brought back to us in the nick of time.\nBut there was one episode after the other.  [laughs]  The investor episode is to tell you.  Schroeder Bank, a private bank, took us on, and said, “Oh, yes, we’ll find clients.”  And they called, and they said, “There’s a Mr. Ianello,” I think his name was, “who’s interested in restaurants and might be interested in investing.”\nAnd the Kenyons were in bed over the weekend, and she was reading the paper, and she turned to Robert and she said, “Robert, the name Ianello, is that familiar to you?”  It was Matty “The Horse” Iannello, who was the one who owned Umberto’s Clamhouse, and when there was this gang rub-out, he was found pleading for his life underneath the clam counter.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nBatterberry:  So this was another scrape, anyhow, close call.  Not that we would have ever gone the way—but it was proposed to us that could be indeed a viable investor in a modern food magazine.\n\nQ:  How different was your idea from whatever Gourmet was at that time?  I can’t remember.\n\nBatterberry:  It was quite different in that there was something pleasantly staid about Gourmet at that point.  It was a very good travel magazine, but the tablecloths tended to be lacey and the recipes were set out in a way that they weren’t for people who really cooked.  It was maybe something you handed your cook or so forth.  It had a kind of archness, not always, though, because Jim Beard wrote for Gourmet, Hugh Johnson did, Gerri Trotta was an excellent writer, but the sum of its parts was suddenly, we thought, a bit old-fashioned.\nWhen Food and Wine first came out, within one year we overtook Gourmet in subscription, two- and three-year subscription renewals.  We didn’t overtake them in subscription numbers, but in terms of the response.  And what we found out, which was the final evidence that we had the right idea in the first place about who would be reading this, the average age of the Food and Wine reader was only a few years lower than the average age of the Gourmet.  I think Gourmet was something like forty-three, forty-four, and ours was forty, whatever.  But the average age of the male reader of Food and Wine was somewhere in the twenties, which meant that very young people were reading it as well, to bring the average down that low.  It essentially was 50-50.  It was actually 51 percent women, 49 percent male.\n\nQ:  That must have been astonishing.\n\nBatterberry:  It was.  People had difficulty believing it, and they had such difficulty believing it, that’s why we had such difficulty with advertising for the first couple of years, and why we needed to refinance.  And then another aspect of the magazine was it was the first magazine that raised money—we raised money as a legal tax shelter for the investors for the match dollars for Hefner.  So there were lots of doctors and dentists and so forth in these groups that were represented by lawyers, and that, of course, in a number of years became no longer a viable way of doing it nor a legal way.  It wasn’t that we became illegal, but there was this period of grace when you could do that.\n\nQ:  With regard to recipes, how would you describe the degree of sophistication?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, you had your choice.  The really sophisticated, complex ones were presented, as I said, in the more complex of the three divisions of complexity, from the most simple to the most complex, but we had good international coverage.  We had diet versions in the back of the book.  Sylvia Sher did a diet version of low calorie—I can’t remember all of them now.  I think low carbohydrate.  So that at least there was one or two recipes you could find in the book if you were on a diet, you would find a version for yourself.\n\tRichard Sax was very young and very good, and we hired him as the head of our test kitchen, and then later he was joined by Chris Styler, Christopher Styler, who is now editor-at-large for Food Arts, and Jim Fobel, who was wonderful at food presentation, but the person who was key was our dear old friend Peter Prestcott, who is a man of many talents and he cooks beautifully, he can make paper sculptures, he could do anything.  He’s a great stylist and he’s very worldly.  He’s lived in many places, and he really helped us in the initial phase.  Peter and I would go out propping together, or one night he spent the night on the kitchen floor to be sure that something was going to be ready for the shoot the next day.  I mean, he was just wonderful.  So we kept Peter as an editor, and he did all sorts of things, and American Express just did not know how to use him properly.\n\nQ:  When did American Express get involved?\n\nBatterberry:  In the early eighties.  We only had the magazine for a few years.\n\nQ:  So when American Express took it over, you were not there?\n\nBatterberry:  Oh no.  Well, they took it over from us.  I mean, we arranged the sale, because Hefner wanted to take his money out and put it into the casino in Atlantic City, where, of course, he never got his liquor license and that was lost.  Our other investors wanted to get their money out and put it into oil, just before the oil crashed in Houston the following year.  So that was a tense period.\n\nQ:  And that was when?\n\nBatterberry:  Eighty-two, I think.  No, no.  Eighty-one.\n\nQ:  That must have been very disappointing.\n\nBatterberry:  Well, it certainly was, but at the same time our feeling was, we comforted ourselves by saying that it was like having a very popular young daughter who marries a billionaire, and you just hope that he was going to take care of her properly.  It was out of the question that we would stay on, because—I’m not going to name names—it was brutally clear that they were going to dumb it down.  I must say, in Dana Cowen, they finally got a very good editor later on.\n\nQ:  I guess what I’m confused about is the people took their money out, then how did you keep going?\n\nBatterberry:  We had to find a new investor, and there were several people interested, but they were dallying, as they always do when they know that you need something done quickly, and also that was getting into another recessionary period.  So when it appeared in Phil Dougherty’s advertising column in the Times, Ariane had spoken with him. On the strength of that, American Express contacted us.  They had had such a success with Travel and Leisure at that point, that they were looking for a food magazine, particularly one that would appeal to and recruit more restaurant clients.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBatterberry - 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Michael Batterberry\t\t\t\t\t\t    Session #2\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t        New York City\n\nDate:  May 27, 2009\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is May 27, and I’m with Michael Batterberry in his offices at Food Arts in Manhattan.\n\tGood afternoon.\n\nBatterberry:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  We were talking about Food and Wine the other day, and I think you wanted to tell me some more about the three-tier system.\n\nBatterberry:  The three-tier approach, which could apply either to costs, so if we presented, let’s say, things for the tabletop, china, silver, so forth, flatware, and there was a kind of theme, we would present the cheapest possible, the cheapest and most imaginative, and then mid range, and then the sky’s the limit for people who liked to splurge from time to time or who liked to collect things for the table.  That would be one example of three range costs, expenses.\nBut it also applied—and I think it worked very well—for the complexity of difficulty of the dish.  So if, for example, we were doing pâtés, we would start with a very simple chopped liver, a very good recipe for a simple traditional chopped liver.  The next tier of complexity might be a pâté campagne, French country pâté, quite simple, and with suggestions obviously about serving it with cornichons, whatever.  The third would be for people who have garnered that sad classification of “food hobbyist.” Awful expression.  Anyway, for people who really love food, no amount of time is too much for them.  They just love it.  They like the challenge.  They love the results.  They take pride in it and so forth.  So we would do from the down and dirty fastest; good; middle range; and then, “Okay.  You want to spend the whole weekend doing this?  If you like, you can do this in steps,” and so forth and so on.  And that spoke to different people, and sometimes it spoke to the same people who just didn’t have the time, but might some other time.\n\nQ:  You started it in 1978?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.\n\nQ:  And so how did that relate to what was happening at that time?  I mean, you must have sensed that there was a wide range of—\n\nBatterberry:  Well, what we had sensed and what we were telling the putative investors when we were raising money for the magazine for those years was that—I always use this as an example, is that so many young men, young guys were going off to college with woks.  Gender taboos were being shattered, and it was no longer considered woman’s work to be in the kitchen, necessarily.  If men felt like doing it, well, go right ahead, rather than just standing around [over a barbecue pit] with an apron saying “Genius at work.” \nAt the same time, rather like Nora in Doll’s House, young women were slamming the kitchen door behind them because it was emblematic of their being indentured to domesticity, and so it was rather like bra burning at the time, you know, to say “No, I don’t cook.  I’m not interested in cooking.”\n\tSo this was reflected—and I know that I did tell you this before, about the initial makeup of the subscribers—in that there were so many young men in their twenties who were subscribing to Food and Wine, which was what we had foreseen with hope and were proven right, even if it always remained a stumbling block for the potential investors, because they said, “Well, maybe you’re right,” but indeed we were.\n\nQ:  How did that relate to what was happening in restaurants at that time?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, various things were happening in restaurants.  Young people were traveling in much greater numbers because they could go coach on jet, and they were seeing much more of the world than their ancestors had, and that entailed eating.  They were tasting the world.  Each successive generation has become much more open to flavors of the world.  There used to be—I find it difficult to grasp from this point in history, but, you know, that “foreign food,” in quotes, was shunned by a lot of mid Americans, because it’s why people changed their names if their names were too foreign, or they ate the dishes of their ancestors at home but they didn’t when they were out because it was immigrant food, and that had a certain stigma attached to it, which was ridiculous.  And smelly food.  People would go, you know, “Oh, garlic.”  They backed away from it.  Well, that, of course, has totally changed, and what a relief.  This was part of the transitionary period.\n\tYou also had such large numbers of young people who were more aware of what it was they were putting into themselves, and that was the reflection of the so-called greening of America at the time.  It was the young people who taught their parents to read labels on the back of things, to be more nutrition-conscious.  That was the very first wave of what now is pandemic, and it was the young people who did it.\nI remember we used to go to New Hampshire for sometimes months on end, in the north of New Hampshire, and an old family house when we were writing books, to finish books, and we remember the first so-called—the locals all called it a health food store, disparagingly, when, in fact, it was natural foods store, and it had countless old herbs and spices, you know, in large glass jars.\n\nQ:  Very old.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, very old, but very numerous which was very sweet.  Sometimes had no animal protein, except for cheese, only no flesh, no animal flesh protein, and they were in touch with the local farmers as well.  I mean, there was no concerted movement to champion the local farmer.  It was just they wanted the freshest and local, and also in those days it was cheaper.\n\nQ:  Whose family house was this?\n\nBatterberry:  Ariane’s father was a doctor and scientist, and he had gone to many scientific conferences, small conferences in Europe, particularly in Austria and Switzerland and so forth, and he loved these little conferences in mountain houses.  So this led him to buy a house that had to be built from the ground up, practically, by Dan Kiley was the architect who later became a very famous landscape architect.  His name was Dr. Simon Ruskin, and that was Dr. Ruskin’s reason for—and also he wanted a country place for his children.  So Ariane saw the 1960s there, and I too, because I first went to New Hampshire, before we were married in the 1960s and saw it was an extension of New England sort of Bostonian conservatism, and that was reflected in the food supplies.  But then you saw—bang—this was the first ray of the future in this very large, very large store, because it was very cheap—it was like a big barn—with the sort of food that people demand today.\n\nQ:  You mean in terms of produce?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, fresh produce and variety of herbs and spices, even if they were, as I say, a bit elderly.  You know, interesting breads, local butter, so forth.\n\nQ:  Did you get to know any of the farmers at that point?\n\nBatterberry:  Oh, we did.  There was an architect who had, I think, several wives and girlfriends and therefore numerous children, and they all worked on a very large farm that he had, and it was more than a farm stand.  You could drive to the farms particularly on certain days, and these attractive kids who were out in the fields all summer would sell you a wide variety of stuff.  But in terms of, let’s say lamb—and I love to cook—we’d have to order it ten days in advance, and then they’d pick it up in Boston, because nobody [else wanted it]—I mean, they raised lamb up there, but they turned lamb into sweaters instead of into dishes.  I guess the great luxury food product was S.S. Peirce in a can because it had this coat of arms on it.  But that’s all changed.  It’s wonderful.  In any case, that was an early transition.\nFor the first anniversary of Food and Wine, there were two elements to it which I think are really significant, in looking back.  Well, first of all, let me explain.  We saved this drowning promotion, a gastronomic promotion that had been half organized, as it turned out, between New Orleans, Louisiana, and France, and it was the old and the new France meeting.  And Paul Prudhomme, who was known but not so widely known in those days and was an impressive figure, was the host chef in New Orleans, and they had signed on some rather young what would be called rising star chefs today, but nobody used that term then, to bring them to New Orleans.  I think the great-grandson of Victor Hugo was involved in this, Pierre Hugo, and he was a silversmith and silver designer, and therefore he designed all these extravagant brochures for this thing and spent all their budget.  So they were in terrible financial straits, and they thought that the whole thing was going to cave.\nWe heard about this, and about Melvin Masters, who later had Jam’s restaurant—Melvin and Janie Masters, an English couple, he was a wine importer and a budding restaurant impresario, as was she, and were a really wonderful couple, and Melvin was involved in this and we got together with him.  It was through Melvin and through Peter Meltzer, who was then our wine editor, who was still in his twenties, that we took it over for them so that they wouldn’t have total loss of face.  It was called La Jeune Gastronomie-- young gastronomy.  So we said, “Great.  Let’s stage it in New York.”\nSo we went to Werner Leroy, who had the Tavern on the Green, and we didn’t know Werner very well then, but he was extremely open to this idea of staging a kind of food festival there in honor of Food and Wine’s first birthday.  And what we said was, “All right, we’ll expand the American chef list to include a woman.”  We had been told about Alice Waters by both Jim Beard and Mary Frances Fisher.  So we contacted Alice, and she said, yes, she would like to do that, the idea being that each one of the featured chefs would do either lunch or dinner over a period of three days, alternating with the French.\nThen we said, well, as Italian food was suddenly receiving the kind of recognition and respect that it hadn’t before, it was getting out of the red sauce ghetto of restaurants—Northern Italian, of course, was the phrase of the moment—we said, “We should have a great young Italian chef.” So Tony May, who was one of the principle founders of Gruppo Ristoratori Italiani, the Italian restaurateur group here to promote the image, to raise the image of Italian food in this country, which they did with enormous success over the years, particularly Tony. He recommended that we get Pierangelo Cornaru from Bergamo, who had just won the Cuocco D’Oro Prize that year, the Golden Chef Award in Italy, as the best young chef in all of Italy, and so he came.\nIt was great.  It was just wonderful.  And so this was the first time that American chefs, meaning Paul and Alice, now who, of course, are icons both, but weren’t then, that they were cooking on an equal footing with the French chefs, with the Charvet brothers from Aix-en-Provence and Alain Dutournier from Paris and Pierangelo from Italy.  And the American press assumed, along with everybody else, even the food press did, that of course because they were Europeans that they were going to be better.  They came from a longer tradition and so forth.  How could Americans really take the stage with them?  Well, the Americans just blew them away, and the Europeans were absolutely shocked.  Shocked.  Shock and awe, when they saw what Paul and Alice did.\n\nQ:  What was so special about what they were doing?\n\nBatterberry:  Well, it was simply so good.  It was so personal.  It was so fully formed.  One was Creole Cajun, much elevated through the prism of Paul’s cooking, and I remember what some of the things were to this day.  I mean, he did a seafood sausage, a kind of andouille, with a buerre blanc sauce and that was the first course, and then he did beef with what he calls a debris sauce, which is made from the sort of semi-charred bits in the pan and so forth, wonderful [savory bitter] taste, not bittersweet. And then there were some cheeses, and then the [dessert] Cajun Cottages, which the pastry chef had made of chocolate.  They looked like Li’l Abner shacks, and the roof was--you could lift the roof, and they were filled with small Creole strawberries that had been picked the day before.  And then a waiter passed about with a warm liqueur sauce, and ladled over [the roofs] so that they melted, and the strawberries [peeked] through the chocolate.\nI was seated next to the young Italian Pierangelo Cornaru at that particular—these were black-tie dinners.  We went all the way, and Werner had wonderful flowers on the tables, and we had a mixed group.  People like Andy Warhol were there and so forth.  It was a great New Yorker group.  And he turned to me and he said, “Oh, like Vietnam,” when he saw this house melting under the napalm sauce.\nAnyway, I said, “Let’s not repeat that, please, at the table.  Thank you.”\nAnyhow, the other element was that there was a reception for a thousand to kick this off, as a cocktail party with wines and spirits and all American hors d’oeuvres, which is to say 90 percent of them were American cheeses.  [We’d met] a young man named Howard Solganik  from Dayton, Ohio, who was in his early twenties and was a pioneer in terms of American food retailing. He had started a shop in Washington called the Georgetown Wine and Food Company, that was ahead of its time.  It only lasted a couple of years.  He had got into a used car and bounced around the country, all over the back roads, finding things that he thought that people who were stationed in Washington, who were from those different parts of the country, would be happy to find in D.C.  So he had a wonderful catalog of places that he’d discovered.  So all the cheeses were American.\nThe press that we got was amazing.  The Washington Post began—this was sheer luck—began its Sunday food section that weekend, and Bill Rice, who was the food editor then, came up to one of these meals and—I’ve forgotten, it had a very snappy headline he gave it, and they gave us the whole first page plus jump, reviewing this idea of American chefs [cooking on the same footing] with European chefs.\n\nQ:  Who were the American chefs at that point?\n\nBatterberry:  Aside from Paul and Alice?\n\nQ:  I mean not necessarily here, but in general.\n\nBatterberry:  Well, this is what we were able to introduce to the American public [in the magazine], really.  We sort of pinpointed the ones in different parts of the country who were doing what was essentially the same thing.  They were taking regional food and reinterpreting it by applying chef standards and techniques to what essentially was probably “mom’s cooking” in different parts of the country. [Or you could possibly call it]  “tribal cooking.”\nThe most numerous group was the Southwest one, and that was Mark Miller, Steven Piles, and Robert del Grande, and I guess Dean Fearing came a little later, John Sedler and Vincent Guerithault, who had Vincent on camelback, and Jean Louis Palladin had started it in Virginia by weaving his own network of suppliers in Amish country, Jamison lamb and so forth.\nVincent told me that he was egged on by Jean Louis, who was everybody’s favorite.  Jean Louis said to him, “You should do American Southwest!”\n\tAnd he said, “But I’m French.  I don’t know what to do.”  He said, “What should I do?”\n\tAnd [Vincent ] said, “Oh, allez, allez put foie gras in a chili.”  [laughter]\nHe said, “So I put foie gras in a chili.  Everyone loved it.”  But then he did his own things.\nThen in New England there was a group—I think the most prominent really is Jasper White.  There was a group of them that worked at a hotel, Lydia Shire among them, and Jasper did the same thing with New England food.  He made chowders sublime.  I remember one of his first courses at his restaurant was Boston brown bread that was baked in a coffee tin and sliced. It was served to support essentially gravlox made out of Atlantic salmon, with heavy sour cream from a New England dairy, that kind of thing.  It was Jasper who really championed the [New England] corn-fed hams and the corncob smoked hams.  That was it.\n\nQ:  This was 1979.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So these were not people who had gone to culinary school primarily.  These were people who had entered food in different ways.\n\nBatterberry:  Some of them went to culinary school.  Some of them were the very first CIA grads.  But numbers of them—I mean, Alice was an anthropologist.  Mark Miller was an anthropologist.  Robert del Grande has his doctorate in biochemistry, etc., etc.  Anne Rosensweig, similarly was an anthropologist.\nYes, because among the taboos that were being shattered along with gender taboos was the social taboo of becoming a chef, because I can’t tell you how many people thirty years ago would call me and say, “Oh, my son has just graduated from Brown, and now he says he wants to be a chef.  Will you please talk to him?”  Meaning would I please tell them not to be a chef.\n\tAnd I’d say, “If that’s what you expect me to say, don’t send him to me, because there’s a whole new world out there.”  That was a huge change.  You had educated people and, not to put too fine a point on it, people who came from comfortable backgrounds that [supported] them—they [may have] seen a lot of the world with their backpacks, but nevertheless, they had the wherewithal to travel.  It was a very heady time.\n\nQ:  All this was happening at a time when actually you couldn’t hold onto [Food and Wine] all that long, so that must have been somewhat disappointing.\n\nBatterberry:  Oh, it was very disappointing in that respect.  It certainly was.  However, I’m still naïve enough to think all things happen for a reason.  [laughs]  And generally it’s true.  Having to sell Food and Wine because our investors wanted their money back was, in a way, a long-term blessing in a way, because otherwise there would be no Food Arts, and essentially what Food Arts is, is a consumer magazine for professionals.  It is a trade magazine, but it’s unlike anybody’s idea of what a trade magazine is meant to be.  It’s not clangy.  It’s just on a different level for professionals, people who have foreknowledge, which is a great blessing if you’re an editor or writer.  You can assume that they already know a certain amount of things; you don’t have to start from scratch.  That is the greatest challenge in food publishing for the general public: how do you reach the person who has been cooking all his or her life and those who have just come to it in the last months or years, without talking above or below heads.\n\nQ:  Before we get to Food Arts, why don’t we talk about what happened in the in-between period after Food and Wine closed, and how you set up Batterberry Associates.\n\nBatterberry:  Well, we had consulted.  Sometimes I can’t even remember some of the people who received our infinite wisdom.  I can, but, you know, I’d to think hard about it.  It was a curious period because we had been contributors to different magazines.  We had been on the masthead of Harper’s Bazaar, as I told you, as the contributing arts editors.  Those roles gave us a sounder or a steadier footing as consultants in a curious way.  We had a lot of colleagues in the publishing world, both in books and in magazines.  We stayed abreast of what was going on in the industry in a way that we don’t anymore.  Now we just focus on the magazine.\n\tWe knew Charles Rollo, who was the senior editor at Time, Inc., and a very, very distinguished European Egyptian, and we used to see him socially.  He called us and said there is this new project going on; it was Teletext.  I believe that was Charles, because we did several things with Time, Inc. and Time Life, and that is how we came to meet Sean McCarthy, who has remained a very close friend—one of the great gifts to that was a very deep friendship—who was the director of the Teletext experiment.  There was another man named Peter Gross, but Sean was really sort of the creative genius.\n\nQ:  And what was this Teletext magazine intended to be?\n\nBatterberry:  What it was, it was downloaded.  There were sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen so-called magazines that were weeklies.  By today’s Internet standards, they were extremely rudimentary, I mean, if not outright crude, but they were very good for the time.  The colors were very limited.  The palette was—I think there were only something like twenty-two hues that you could use.  And it was downloaded from satellite.\n\nQ:  Onto a television set?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, and they had identified a gizmo that the Japanese had developed, that could adapt any television set to make it a receptor.  You had a little keypad, and once you were plugged into the system, whatever your TV set was functioned as your computer screen.  So Time, Inc. thought, obviously as they were Time, Inc., that people would be using this new medium for news headlines and updates and finance, sports, weather, etc., all the obvious things.\n\nQ:  This was when?\n\nBatterberry:  This was in the early eighties, the early to mid eighties, started it.  It was enormously expensive for them.  I mean, it was a huge budget.  This was at a time when there [turned out to be] a famous internecine war between print and new media.  They had put aside a budget, I think of almost 200 million dollars, for a cable magazine, and then it turned out that not enough cable had been laid.  It was jumping the gun.\n\tIn any case, to get back, they had a twenty-three-hour newsroom with twenty-three hours a day updates, and on the twenty-fourth they slept, I guess, and all these different magazines for different interests.  At the last minute, they said, “Ooh, we don’t have anything for the little lady.  We don’t have any food, cooking for—,” so they in-house devised a publication.  It was called Dining In.  They weren’t happy.  They knew that it needed help.  So we were called in and we were shown what they had done, and indeed they needed help.  They needed so much help that we looked at one another as if to say, “We can’t tell them all in one fell swoop what needs to be done here.  We’ll simply call every couple of days, ‘Oh, and by the way, if you’re going to make those changes, you could do this.’”\n\tSo after about ten days, they said, “Would you just come in and just do this?”  And they gave us a budget, a nice budget to hire—we got Maurice Moore-Betty, who had a very good cooking school here, to develop the recipes, to test the recipes in his kitchen.  Peter Meltzer did the wine pairings.  It was subdivided into little features, if you would.  One was Global Gourmet, food from around the world, a kind of international menu with some recipes.  One was Health.  One was Dining Alone, recipes for one, etc., etc.  And so there were a number of these kind of subcategories.\n\nQ:  What was the idea, that people might subscribe to the whole series?\n\nBatterberry:  They were putting this in a test market in Orlando and San Diego for two years.  The idea was then to roll it out nationwide.\n\nQ:  And people would pay for it?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  What made it possible was the Japanese brought in the gizmo at an affordable price so they could supply you, if you were a subscriber to the service, with the adapter for your set.\n\nQ:  It took an adapter to your own television set.\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.  You had to have this thing.  It was almost like a cable box, only smaller, but in principle, it was a parallel to a cable box.  Anyway, the Japanese swore that they could bring it in for a certain price.  Well, as this progressed, the Japanese said, “No.  As a matter of fact, it’s going to cost more and more and more.”\nThen there was a confluence of factors.  They tested it for well over a year, spent millions of dollars on this, and to their dismay, in a way, they found that of all these different magazines they had up, there were only three that the people who were using the services wanted to see more of and used frequently, and the top one. Because this was at the time when electronic games were at their first fever pitch-- they had devised electronic games for different attention spans and so forth, so electronic games, I believe, was number one.  Number two was food, and three was—makes no difference.  The top three were games, food, and what was lumped together as entertainment.  There was everything from movie and television listings, to movie reviews and book reviews and celebrity gossip and so forth.  All the other stuff was way down in the middle, but, you know, people said, “Fine,” but they weren’t really using it.  They weren’t using the news in the way that Time, Inc. believed was their strength.\n\tSo this, combined with the cable magazine burning through half of their initial budget in one year, a lot of these different things conspired.  They said, “Okay, we have to shelve it.”\nBut it certainly reassured us about the public interest in food, and we also got name chefs on board.  At this time, Ariane and I had an idea, “Okay.  Let’s do something called The Living Cookbook, and we will collect recipes.”\nIs this taking too long?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nBatterberry:  Essentially I was able to do something that they hadn’t done before at Time. [We were curious as to] why people would be looking at this on a screen if they could look at a newspaper or a magazine.  Something had to happen that couldn’t happen on a piece of paper of an interactive nature.  So I said, “Let’s break recipes into little bites,” if you will.  I always use the example of the lattice-top rhubarb pie.  Now, a lot of people know how to make a lattice top; a lot of people don’t.  So if you didn’t know, you pressed a certain number and you got a simulated animation which was done by an animation artist, of how you made the strips and criss-crossed them and so forth.  Similarly, if it said “trim rhubarb” and you didn’t know what that meant, you pressed a corresponding number and you saw the leaves and the poisonous parts being eliminated.  And some of them were fun.  I mean, peeling garlic, it went “Bam!” [when slammed by a knife blade ] and so on.   People loved watching these things.  They watched them just to watch them, even if they weren’t going to cook, and kids loved watching [these little animated demos].\n\tI said, “We have to do this and we have to not start scrolling from the top again.”  Everything was still sort of rudimentary.  You have to be able to get right back where you left off, or otherwise people are going to get mad.\n\t[None of Time’s] young space cadets wanted to develop new things [with the equipment at hand], they just wanted new toys, and said, “No, we can’t do that.”\n\tI said, “Do it.  Please, just do it.”  They were able to do it.  Well, of course it had applications across the boards for all the other magazines for getting in and out and back again.  But it was the most entertaining and practical for the food one.\n\tSo having learned that, and that people really responded, I mean, they did multi-million-dollar tests for us.  We went to Craig Claiborne and James Beard, and essentially they were willing to give us their life work for electronic reproduction if we could get this together.  But it was too soon.  They were too old.  You know, it wasn’t going to happen in their lifetime, really.  But nevertheless, they agreed to that, and we spoke to Milton Glaser to see if he would entertain the idea of possibly designing it.  Well, I don’t think he was that interested, but he was interested in what we were doing and in hearing about it.\nThis slowly evolved.  I cannot remember the details of this.  There was a young man who was with one of the—oh, what do you call them?  Sort of the news service, the syndicators, column syndicators, who was a whiz kid in this brand-new computer field.  Mark Burns was his name.  We got together and he told us about what the possibilities were in computerized media, and we told him about our idea for this Living Cookbook, because we thought, you know, if you had all the techniques in the world accumulated in one service, you could simply adapt any recipe of anyone’s collected wherever to that kind of system.\n\tSo this grew into—then we have a Chinese friend, a brilliant younger friend named Kimball Chen, whose father was in petroleum transport and he was very, very secure and had good financial connections.  Kimball was very interested in electronic media of all sorts and electronic businesses, computerized businesses.  And so we came up with another thing, but it grew from that.\nOh, in the meantime, I’ve completely forgot, Mort Persky, whom I told you about, who had been my guru over at Playboy, was involved in a company—I can’t even remember the name of it.  It was Sears and CBS and somebody else, and they were up in White Plains, I think, and they were getting into computerized media and there was a food element to it.  So we were brought in as consultants to that, contributing consultants.\nThen we got to this next thing, and what do we call it?  Teletext.  That was Teletext.  The other one was—Ariane I have to ask.  This is awful, because we spent two years on it.  The idea was to install in supermarkets an electronic food magazine that would give recipes every week, and some of them would be tied into coupons, and you’d be able to touch-screen the recipes you wanted, and out would come the coupons that would help you save money on reproducing that recipe.\n\nQ:  That’s amazing.\n\nBatterberry:  And we went to [financier] Jimmy Goldsmith, who then was the Grand Union’s tycoon, among others.  He thought it was very interesting.  We were out there doing this, but at the same time Food Arts was—I have to work backwards, because Food Arts came out in’88, but it took us three and a half years to get the money, so it was in the middle of 1984 that we started, really.  I put together the editorial plan.  Ariane put together the business plan.\n\nQ:  Before we get there, you mentioned James Beard and Craig Claiborne being willing to work with you on this.  Beard was a friend of yours, but you had also worked with him on your Good Living project.  What was that and when was that?\n\nBatterberry:  Good Living was—all these kind of things washed on the same shore.  That was about 1982 or ’83.  It was immediately after Food and Wine, and, yes, we interviewed Jim in his house.  That was filmed by the Maysles brothers.\n\nQ:  What were you filming him doing?\n\nBatterberry:  Oh, demos, chatting.  I have a lot of stuff that never made into that edited half hour, because it was all so—there was Jim, there was Paul Prudhomme and Martha Stewart.  He did a demo of a flank steak, as I recall, marinating and cutting it.  He did a couple of simple demos in his kitchen, and we talked about food and things that he liked, and what would be his favorite simple meal, that old chestnut of a question.  But it was a large can of caviar and a bottle of frozen vodka and fresh blini and drawn butter, that kind of thing, and it was charming.  And then you got a little bit of a look at his house.\n\nQ:  And what was the idea for the Good Living films?\n\nBatterberry:  Good Living was about living well, with the emphasis on food and drink, and people who lived well, who cooked well.  Martha showed how she stenciled the floors as well as she did a cooking demo.  She carved a red cabbage into a container for a dip for crudité and that sort of thing, and she made a fresh sweet mustard sauce, that kind of thing.\n\nQ:  But you were working exclusively with Beard or with all three of them?\n\nBatterberry:  All three.  They were all three in it [each on location, in Greenwich Village, Louisiana, and Connecticut].\n\nQ:  And the idea for this Good Living series was as films that would be distributed?\n\nBatterberry:  [Yes, this was the pilot for a series]. We were taken on by Public Television  at the behest of a man named Jerry Toobin, who was head of Channel 13 here.  Channel 13 took it for thirteen months, appropriately.  It was handled by a couple of different outlets.  Charleston took it on, and they kept saying, “Oh, don’t worry about this.  It took us three years to get the money for our series on China.”  We never flagged.  We were determined to do it because we had to raise over $100,000 to do the pilot, and most of that money came from Marline, who had been one of our investors in Food and Wine, and they were loyal to us.\n\nQ:  And your role in this pilot was as producers?\n\nBatterberry:  Producers, and we were on screen, interviewing.\n\nQ:  Was the film shown as the pilot?\n\nBatterberry:  It was tested.  It was tested by Vic Media, and it was tested in New Orleans and Boston and several places, and it got very, very good ratings, very good ratings, but the problem was that it was film, not video, all on location, and very expensive.  And we didn’t want to do just one interview per segment.  The idea was to do three.  It probably would have been best with just two, but it went on and on and on, and Public Television kept saying, “Oh yes.  Don’t lose heart.”  Well, at a certain point we were really tired of raising money.  We said if we were raising money, let’s raise money for something that’s definitely going to happen, and so we were pursuing Food Arts at the same time.\n\nQ:  Tell me how that came about, Food Arts, or what your idea was for it.\n\nBatterberry:  Well, to go back to what you asked me about, were we disappointed, some of the other magazines began to do a few more things about chefs, but nobody was doing something for the food world itself, as a publication, that had the style that you associate with the restaurant world.  We had a lot of professional readers of Food and Wine, who said to us—now mind you, I really like what Dana Cowan does with Food and Wine now.  I think she’s done a terrific job.  But it really tottered along for a while because they dumbed it down after we went our way.\n\nQ:  So your idea for Food Arts was?\n\nBatterberry:  Food Arts…We knew there were trade publications.  We had never really investigated them.  We’d never been in the trade field.  We simply assumed that someone had to be doing a magazine that answered the interests of this broad sweep of people who were now in the food, hospitality, whatever, worlds, where what they had in common was they all fail or succeed on the quality and popularity of their food.  Well, there wasn’t one.  We looked at them, and they tried to be all things.  They would pay lip service to what is called, in the trade jargon, you know, table service—but didn’t, not really.  Who cared how many chicken nuggets had sold last month?  There were charts and that sort of thing.  It certainly wasn’t of interest to the readers that we knew were there, because we knew them.  We knew many of them.  So we made a magazine for them.\n\nQ: And this was the late eighties?\n\nBatterberry:  It was the late eighties when it finally came out, but we started it— I drew up the editorial.  Ariane and I had the dummy done a couple years before.  So it was mid eighties.\n\nQ:  And the state of restaurants in general at that time was healthy?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, you could see it was growing.  It was nothing like it became, but more and more young intelligent people were going into the field who wouldn’t have one generation before, and this was true of the hotel world as well as the restaurant world.\n\nQ:  So when you drew up the plan for the magazine, it was generally what?\n\nBatterberry:  In what sense?\n\nQ:  It was for the people in the food world, people in the hospitality business?\n\nBatterberry:  It was for chefs, restaurateurs, high-volume caterers, which is to say hotel dining, banquet departments, cruise lines, resorts.  The first whiff of good food was coming out of casinos, etc.  There is quite a little universe.\n\nQ:  It was a very new idea, though, wasn’t it, to take essentially what could have been a trade magazine and present it as a real magazine?\n\nBatterberry:  Totally.  Oh, and the competition.  The people who were already in it. The other magazines had all started as various fast-food magazines, with the exception maybe of one, and they tried to push us out immediately by painting us as elitist, as if, you know, our only readers were, you know, Sirio at Le Cirque.  Well, no.  Our readers serve between 13 to 14 billion meals a year.\n\nQ:  Currently?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, and that’s been for quite a while.  For us, what defines trade, what defines our readership, is that they all have table service and wine and spirits.\n\nQ:  And what other kinds of features were you envisioning?\n\nBatterberry:  What we do now.  I mean, if you look at the dummy now, it’s amazingly like—it really is an outline for Food Arts today.  All the things that we know, that we talk about when we’re with our friends in the business.  Where have you been traveling?  What was going on?  Who’s the hot new chef in Malaga?  What’s the latest equipment that really has ramifications for the future?  What are the design trends?  Let’s talk about food history, tabletop, drink.  And above all, though, we like scoops, pointing to the new things as they happen and being the first there to tell them.  On the strength of that, for a while Ariane and I did a quarterly column for USA Today based on what was in Food Arts in terms of trends.\n\nQ:  This was really a long time ago, in a way, and it’s lasted consistently and grown since then.\n\nBatterberry:  Oh yes.  But I’ll tell you some of the things that weren’t initially there.  Certainly health and nutrition was not, because everybody thought a nutritionist was  somebody with a hairnet, you know.  We just didn’t think that was for us; that was more for an institutional magazine.  Well, no.  And agriculture.  A number of people said to us, “Aren’t you committing publishing suicide by talking about things that might be at odds with food manufacturers?  Are you going to alienate advertisers?”\nThat was just a risk we had to take.  We said, “Look.  We’re not slamming them.  We’re simply saying this is a movement.”  It wasn’t called sustainability then.  Organics had been around since the late sixties, and we didn’t stress that so much, but whenever somebody bought a farm on the outskirts of town, whether it was [a restaurateur like] Gordon Sinclair in Chicago or whoever, yes, that was of interest.  And endangered seafood, etc.  And so we began cover that in a way and skirting the politics of food.  And certainly the person who gave me the courage to do that more was Gus Schumacher.  Having him, number one, as an advisor and his having been the Under Secretary of Agriculture under Clinton’s administration, having his knowledge, plus his knowledge of the world through the World Bank and agricultural policy around the world and needs. He’s on our masthead as our agriculture contributing editor.  Who else has that?  No one.\n\nQ:  How did you meet Gus?\n\nBatterberry:  We met Gus back in the eighties through Tiziana and Hugh Hardy, the architect.  They have a country place in Massachusetts.  Gus was then the Commissioner of Agriculture of the State of Massachusetts, and Tiziana Hardy raises exotic poultry and is very interested in proper farming, etc.\nThe Hardys had met Gus a number of times, and we met at a Sunday lunch there and struck up an acquaintanceship, and then this is something that grew.  To me it was so interesting.  I had never been in contact with someone of his sort of august office, if you will, in federal government.  He wasn’t federal government.  What am I saying?  But, you know, the Commissioner of Agriculture, that was just out of my circle.  Mine was more culinary and literary.  So I was delighted.\n\nQ:  And, of course, he had come from a farm background.\n\nBatterberry:  He came from a farm background, and he knows the world and he’s very wise and has this burning need to help farmers, to help to keep the small farm system going, whether it’s by helping new waves of immigrants find farmland and integrate them into the local communities, etc., or what.\nSo what eventually happened was, what really turned me on about Gus was that he had started this program.  He freely admitted he didn’t know anything about restaurants and chefs, except that he liked them.  There were a lot of small farms that were failing in Massachusetts in the eighties, and as the Commissioner of Ag, he felt, well, why not try and get the two together and see if we can weave some sort of mutual support system.  Apparently it was very awkward at first, the first couple of meetings, but then it took.  It was such a paradigm, a sort of template, and so easy to copy if you have the stamina and the will to see it through.\n\tThen we didn’t see each other for a number of years, until I heard he was in Washington with Clinton, and we had lunch.  I won’t go through the whole thing, but it was clear that we were still very much on the same wavelength.  I said, “Gus, why not—”  He had an organization then that was federally funded, called the Immigrant Farmers Initiative, which was, as I just said, to place immigrants or help immigrants find farm positions or land.  With Food Arts we could broadcast this to a whole country of chefs, encouraging them to support the local farm systems and sort of follow his lead, and would he be interested in doing this through Food Arts.  So this is how we came together, and we decided to drop “immigrant” from it and call it the New American Farmer Initiative, so as to include women.\nThen I got Michel Nischan, who was the chef at the W [hotel] at Heartbeat, cooking healthy food that didn’t have little asterisks all over it, he became the host chef for that and we started a project, the three of us together, in New York bringing the food of immigrant farmers from Massachusetts to New York restaurateurs—chefs, rather, which was very, very hard.\n\nQ:  It was hard, as I recall, because the distribution was one of the major problems.\n\nBatterberry:  Absolutely.  Even things like parking a van outside for too long if you were delivering something.  But nevertheless, it was successful enough to keep the ball rolling and the organization rolling ahead, and Gus was able to get some Endowment funding for it.  Then it’s changed its name and it now has evolved into Wholesome Wave.\n\nQ:  The initiative?\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Wholesome Wave being the foundation?\n\nBatterberry:  I believe Gus’ title is chairman now, and Michel is the President—I don’t know how it goes, the titles exactly.  I can find out.\n\nQ:  But the idea behind the foundation is what?\n\nBatterberry:  It is to make local farm food available to people who would not be able to afford it otherwise.  It is to integrate into local school systems, colleges, etc.  The latest development, which is really so promising, even in this difficult economic era, period, they are getting some solid funding for it.  I’m on the board.  I think we’re having a board meeting soon to see how this latest development is faring, which essentially it is doubling the value of food stamps when used in farmers’ markets.  This idea has resonated with a lot of philanthropic groups whom I see supporting Wholesome Wave into its next stage.\n\nQ:  How much of this kind of activity were you able to have written about in the magazine?\n\nBatterberry:  Oh, we did drip, drip, drip, drip, you know, like drip coffee.  I think a major story every once in a while is needed on whatever subject you think is deserving.  However, I do believe in repetition, just showing different facets of a subject that people don’t know enough about and should know more.  Rather than slamming them over the head with something preachy, is to give them—all right, and then give them some serious, such as the article that you wrote.\n\nQ:  This is unusual material, nevertheless, to put in a magazine.  The magazine essentially was supported by your advertisers, yes?\n\nBatterberry:  Right.\n\nQ:  And the advertisers obviously were not small farmers.  Did you have any difficulty with that?\n\nBatterberry:  Far fewer incidents than I ever would have dreamed, because what it is now, now it’s an issue of sustainability.  It’s all part of the bigger picture.  Everybody wants to get on board.  Last year when we did that special issue, the special report on the state of food and sustainability, we had a special advertising section in which advertisers could describe their positive efforts and activities in response to sustainability.\n\nQ:  This is a pretty big shift in thinking from when you first started certainly Food and Wine.  I don’t know if it shifted your thinking, but in terms of advertisers and readers.\n\nBatterberry:  Well, the huge change, and this is what we’ve also drip, drip, drip, dripped over the years, is that the chefs now make the decisions.  Chefs didn’t make decisions in earlier generations of policy nature or what equipment they were buying.  This was in the hands of the owners or whoever else, and they really were not treated with enough respect.  That’s totally changed, and advertisers, rightfully, want to know the chefs and the restaurateurs because they understand that those are the people who make the purchasing decisions.  It’s a completely leveled playing field.\n\nQ:  So to the point of view of money, in terms of getting out the magazine, do you have any difficulty getting enough from advertisers?\n\nBatterberry:  Oh, advertising is always a challenge, that famous euphemism.  The last few weeks, as an example, serves as an example.  We have the goodwill of the advertising community because Food Arts as a magazine, as a publication, generates goodwill.  We talk about the positive.  I believe firmly in showing what works rather than sniping at what doesn’t, because it’s more useful information, not candy-coating anything.  We have a conference that we do now every year with the Culinary Institute of America out at Graystone in California, which is for F and B directors of major hotel chains, cruise lines, and so forth, with wonderful speakers and involves a bit of culinary in terms of tastings, but it has to do with subjects of common concern and interest to all of them.  Some advertisers sponsor this because they want to meet these people.  So everybody benefits from it.\nAnd similarly at the restaurant show in Chicago, we just had our eleventh annual fundraising barbecue with S.O.S., Share Our Strength, fighting hunger, and we, at this point, have in the past ten years raised well over a million dollars for them by bringing sponsors.  Sponsors can have stands at this barbecue, which is billed as a competition.  It’s a very friendly competition.  It’s fun.  People love this party, and it’s only open to chefs and restaurateurs and hotel operators.\n\tSo, again, advertisers love to be sponsors for this, and to be sponsors they’re advised also to give.  Usually it’s $10,000 to S.O.S., as well as setting up a booth with chefs and so forth, as a contribution to the party itself.  Food Arts is a player, and our readers know—this sounds fatuous, but it’s true—our readers know we love them, that we really respect and like them, that it’s almost like a club journal.\n\nQ:  When it started, though, would you have envisioned that sustainability, hunger, issues like that would have been part of your mix?\n\nBatterberry:  No, I did not.  We did not.\n\nQ:  So that’s been one of the really big changes.\n\nBatterberry:  Huge. Huge. Certainly we didn’t foresee speaking about health issues so openly either, gender issues, social issues, diversity.  Ten years ago we had a [racially] diversity cover shot in Washington, and I’m so gratified, enormously gratified by that that things had developed in such a way that maybe we can part of that and promote the proper things.\n\nQ:  There’s something else that’s changed somewhat over the years is the James Beard Foundation.  I’m not quite sure to what extent you’ve been involved in that.\n\nBatterberry:  Well, this is a very difficult subject for me in a way.  I’m all for the Beard Foundation.  I declined to be on the board twice, under two different regimes, for a very simple reason, that I think some people find difficult to grasp or even believe, and that is the people who aspire to Beard Awards feel that you have some magical inside track if you’re officially connected to the Foundation itself.  And when we were judges, I was very uncomfortable with the number of times I was approached by people--that really surprised me, who some of them were—asking didn’t I know the way to get a nomination or so forth and so on, and I would say, “Look.  No.  This is all above board.  This is how it’s done.”  Numbers of people don’t believe that.  This is a challenge to the Beard Foundation.\nAnd, of course, it didn’t help having the scandal.  Ariane and I feel very strongly that in a way that Len Pickell took a fall for a number of people in that he wasn’t alone in sort of grandiose travel program and so forth, you know, finding people for the Beard House, but I don’t want to go there.  It’s over with.  Dorothy Hamilton did a very good job of scooping it up with Thomas Keller and a few others, and that’s when they asked me to be part of that, and I said, “No.  Please understand that we’ll do whatever we can at Food Arts to say positive things about [and support] the Beard Foundation, report who won the significant awards and so forth.”\n\nQ:  The Foundation was originally set up to keep James Beard’s name alive, but it’s come to represent different things now of a larger empire.\n\nBatterberry:  Well, Julia Child—yes.  Barbara Kafka was in on it, was very close to Jim.  Barbara didn’t stay there very long.  I don’t speak ill of the dead, but Peter Kump, he did many positive things for the industry, but Jim would spin in his grave, because the one thing he loathed was being exploited.  And there were a number of people—you should hear Jeremiah Tower on the subject—you know, who suddenly were Jim’s best friends.  Afterwards Jeremiah said, “Well, it’s amazing I never saw them there at dinner.”  Exaggerated intimacy and discernable personal gain.\n\nQ:  Nevertheless the Beard Awards do represent certain stature in the industry.\n\nBatterberry:  They do [most certainly].\n\nQ:  And I wonder how you feel about having them in the name of James Beard, how appropriate is that?\n\nBatterberry:  Oh, I think that he would love it, really, truth to be told.  Sure he would.  He loved good restaurants.  He loved being part of the scene, and he was good at it.  I mean, he was a sought-after consultant I mean, the Four Seasons [et al].\n\nQ:  And in the overall, if you had to pick one person to be representative of this, the good things of this industry, does it make sense to have him—\n\nBatterberry:  Yes.\n\nQ:  —I mean, the energy and—\n\nBatterberry:  Yes, it makes—you know, he was a shaman.  He’s from Oregon.  He’s a man of the world.  Oh, how he would have loved to have been part of the Obama age.  I mean, absolutely.  He was such a staunch Democrat.  He and Ariane would go on for hours about Democratic policy to what was happening, Democratic Party gossip.  He loved a lot of different things.  He loved the arts.  I can’t think of anybody better, certainly.  I do think that Craig Claiborne is tragically underestimated and forgotten now, because I think he contributed hugely to the progress of food in this country, too.\n\nQ: Through the cookbooks?\n\nBatterberry:  Through the cookbooks and I think it was Craig who established modern food journalism.\n\nQ:  And that’s a subject for another time.

It’s September 22, 2009, and I’m with Hillary Baum at her home in Riverdale, New York.\n\tGood morning.\n\nBaum:  Hi, Judith.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we start this with your telling me where and when you were born and something about your early life, where it took place, what your parents were like.\n\nBaum:  I was born in New York City in a hospital that doesn’t exist anymore on the West Side, and the first couple of years of my life I lived on the East Side of New York City, and then we started our moving around, which we did over several years when I was young, and moved up to New Rochelle, New York, and then the next thing I remember is we moved to Florida, where we lived till I was about five or six years old, and then we came back up to New Jersey for a few years, ultimately coming back into New York City when I was about eleven or twelve years old.  Then I became very aware that the reason we kept moving around so much was because of my father’s career.\n\nQ:  How did your father’s career necessitate those moves?\n\nBaum:  Because he was going to work for different people in different places.  And I realized, I guess, around that age how really important my dad’s work life was.  Even though I don’t have specific memories of his being away from home a lot, I do remember as an elementary school kid that my dad was never home for dinner.  [laughs]  Then I understood, well, that had everything to do with the kind of work he did in the restaurant business.  So for those first few years and actually for many years, my mom was the mainstay, the base, really, for all home life and a very attentive and very reliable kind of mother.\n\tI have two younger brothers.  One brother is just a couple years younger, and then there’s a bit of a gap.  So my brothers are Ed and Charles, with Charles being the older one of the two of them.\nWe lived in Summit, New Jersey, and then we moved to South Orange, New Jersey, and it was around that time that my dad opened his first giant restaurant, which was the Newarker restaurant at the Newark Airport, and it’s then I understood that my father was very prominent and also that we could have incredible birthday parties as kids by going to some of these restaurants and having a sense of tremendous celebration and so forth in our lives that were very often associated with going to these places.\n\nQ:  Before he opened the Newarker and started his own business, did he have jobs working for people?\n\nBaum:  Oh yes.  The Newarker was not his own business.  He did not have his own business until very much later.\n\nQ:  So what kind of jobs in the restaurant business did he have before that?\n\nBaum:  I’m sure that somebody will correct me on this, but I think he started off being like the food and beverage director.  He was basically doing a lot of the accounting work for, I want to say, Zeckendorf.  One of his assignments was to take on a nightclub to make sure—I think they wanted this business to fail or something.  I guess my dad must have worked for an accounting company first, and I think one of his clients must have been the person who owned the nightclub, and so he got involved in the nightclub business to begin with.\nThen when we moved down to Florida, he worked for Shine, and they had the Roney Plaza and the really famous hotel area just north of Miami, whose name is escaping me right now.  Boca Raton.  So I guess my dad must have run all the food and beverage operations in those places.\n\tThen he came up to New York and worked for Abe Wechsler.  It’s a chain that doesn’t exist anymore that turned into Restaurant Associates, and so then Joe was at Restaurant Associates for many years until I guess I was graduating from college, so until 1969, 1970.  It was during that time, between the mid to late fifties, in that time that the whole American restaurant industry really blossomed very much under his influence.\n\tBut here I was, still a kid, and spent a good portion of time being very aware of the development of these restaurants and being in the restaurants, though my father had a very firm policy that his kids were never to go into any of the restaurants unaccompanied by one of the parents.  There were other kids that were allowed to go in, and my father felt it was really bad for the morale of the staff and that we were never ever to do that when we were young.\n\tBut one of my fondest memories is when they opened the Four Seasons, I remember that my mother—especially the grand opening of the Four Seasons was such a huge deal, but for every new season like it would have been, I guess, tonight, since today’s the autumn equinox, was a huge special event, which was a change of the seasons at the Four Seasons.  It was a huge press event.  It was a huge culinary event.  Everything changed in the restaurant, the uniforms, I guess some of the plantings.  I mean, everybody talks about how the color on the ribbon on the typewriters and the menu colors changed, and certainly the menus themselves changed to reflect the change in the seasons.  But part of my memory is of my mother getting really dressed up to go for this big opening.  It was a very big event, and it would happen on a seasonable basis.  My mom spent a lot of time in my dad’s restaurants.\nSo as I was turning into a slightly older kid and we had moved into Manhattan by then, and that was primarily because of my dad’s hours and his crazy professional life.  My mother went back to college.  She was developing as an artist.  She was a sculptor, but she was also extremely involved in the North Side Center for Child Development.  I guess she started there as a volunteer and then eventually got very involved there with young kids from disadvantaged social as well as emotional situations, actually.  That’s what North Side Center was about.\n\nQ:  Let me ask you about the Four Seasons.  Did you understand what it was about?\n\nBaum:  Oh yes, I did, as I described.  I understood and it really had a huge impression on me.\n\nQ:  Tell me about that.\n\nBaum:  Well, that this concept of seasonality, it was so much a part of the concept of the restaurant, and so it definitely had a lot to teach a kid like me.  I was very interested.  I also was aware pretty early on, I don’t how early, but pretty early, that a lot of what was going on there was also this development of relationships with farmers.  I remember my dad used to talk about these trips they would make to Pennsylvania and going to these greenhouses and how they had special things that were produced for the restaurant.  I remember that, to me, that seemed like something very, very new and exciting.  I don’t think I understood the significance of it at that moment, how innovative it really was at that time.\n\nQ:  Was it his idea?\n\nBaum:  Well, he was very much the creative force behind the restaurant, but he had a team of people that he worked with as well.  I certainly wasn’t privy to those magic brainstorming moments, but there were a lot of people involved in the development of that, including Jim Beard was very involved at the Four Seasons, as was Mimi Sheraton.  Maybe Barbara Kafka was involved, and I know she worked with Joe later for sure.\n\nQ:  Did you meet those people?\n\nBaum:  Yes, I met a lot of those people, and I got to know them more as I grew older, but I was a teenager.  I was in junior high school and high school during those times.  One of the things that is so funny to me is that there’s a bunch of people who I know who are my colleagues and my really good friends, and we would swear we were sitting back to back, you know, whether it was at the Four Seasons or at La Fonda del Sol or some place like that, because a lot of people who are really involved in food also grew up in those restaurants at the same time as I did, only, obviously, my relationship was a little bit different.\n\nQ:  I worked in the Time and Life Building for a little while, so we were very aware of the La Fonda del Sol, but to us it was a place where people went for two-, three-martini lunches and not for the likes of us.\n\nBaum:  Well, that’s where I had my Sweet Sixteen.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nBaum:  That had a gigantic influence.\n\nQ:  How so?\n\nBaum:  Well, because the food was outrageous and so appealing and so different, the décor was like nothing anybody had ever seen, and all those little Alexander Girard scenes, all that incredible folk art that was in there was something of tremendous interest visually and also culturally.  But also it was then, and really before, but it was then that I realized how significant my dad’s work was in terms of the artists and the architects and the graphics people and the advertising people, including, of course, the chefs who I haven’t really mentioned yet, but that he put together these incredible teams of professionals that all would come together under his direction, really, to create these places that I think he had very much envisioned, but I think was very much the product of this tremendous creativity that he brought together in one place where there was always a lot of give-and-take amongst the people who were part of this team.\n\nQ:  What was the attitude toward food like in your home?\n\nBaum:  Well, it took me a while to figure out that my father was not a chef, that that was not what he did.  My mother was a wonderful home cook.  I think certainly a lot of it was self-taught, but also she was able to take classes with Jim Beard and went to some of these early tastings, and she took classes with Paula Peck, Albert Stockli and others.\n\nQ:  You mean for the restaurants?\n\nBaum:  Yes.  She participated in that.  I have found like notes from that had to do with Albert Stockli’s recipes for the Four Seasons and other places, and so I know my mom was involved.  But as kids, we always had home-cooked dinner on the table every night, and dinner was a very important time and everybody had to be at the table.\n\tWhen my dad was around, it was a big family joke, but the only time we would see my dad when we were young was on Sunday mornings he didn’t go anywhere.  That was time when he was home, and the big joke was that he always liked to tease my mom about how long certain things were in the refrigerator.  So he’d go into the refrigerator and he’d start pulling things out, and the big thing that Joe would do was he would make an omelet of whatever he could find, and we had to eat it.  [laughs]\n\tBut then, actually, my dad got much more involved in cooking and the pleasures of outdoor cooking and grilling and so forth.  They had a country home in northern Westchester in North Salem, and that’s when my dad was in the kitchen and at the grill and got really involved, and we used to do these incredibly delicious, fabulously fresh meals but as a family.  They had a giant kitchen.  We were all in there all the time, all cooking together, and it was quite, quite wonderful.\n\nQ:  Jim Beard’s grilling book was one of his very earliest books.  Do you think that that had any impact on your father’s grilling?\n\nBaum:  I don’t know.  [laughs]  I can’t really say, you know.  My father was certainly a wonderful instinctive cook, but he didn’t always have time to do that, and a lot of the way we saw food at home very often reflected his personal likes, but a lot of that time what that meant was a big spread of various things, you know, always vast platters of tomato and onion salads and stuff like that that was always next to the seventeen different kinds of herring that would be on the table or something like that.\n\tBut a lot of the tremendous generosity about food that was expressed through the restaurants was very often expressed in our home, especially around special events or Bar Mitzvahs, weddings, all those kinds of things.  They were always things we’ve always done in our own home and they’ve always been extremely influenced by my dad.  So I have socked away menus, insane shopping lists from when we went on family trips and we took coolers of stuff with us.  Like my son’s Bar Mitzvah, it was like insane.  It was all over the outside here.  There was a whole tent that was all from Russ & Daughters.  [laughs]  Still close friends, even though my parents are gone for many years.  Anyway, it was crazy.  And even for my own wedding, it was somewhat of a potluck.  My father’s friends brought dishes.\n\nQ:  That’s wonderful.  Now, what kind of friends were these?\n\nBaum:  These were people like Jim Beard and Alfredo Viazzi and a bunch of other restaurateurs who actually came and brought the dishes for my wedding.  I have to admit I couldn’t taste anything.  I was too excited, but I hear it was great.  It looked great.  [laughs]\n\tAnyway, the influences at home were on many different levels around food and interest in food, but also the interest in presentation, the interest in sourcing.  When Joe opened one of the restaurants at the [World] Trade Center, downstairs next to the Big Kitchen was one of my favorite restaurants, The Market Bar and Dining Rooms. On the menu they listed not the producers, but the purveyors.\n\nQ:  And that was early.\n\nBaum:  This was like in the mid-seventies, ’76, when they opened everything in the Trade Center, and so I don’t know.  I assume that Jim Beard had worked with him on all the places, but in particular I know he did Windows on the World.  So did Michael Whiteman, [Barbara] Kafka. Zraley and others. There was the Big Kitchen down there, which probably was one of the first what we now call food courts, but a lot of that preparation that they did for that, I know I have the pictures, they went to Europe, they went to the great marketplaces in Europe, and that was the kind of thing that they used for influence in terms of how they put together the Big Kitchen.\n\tIt was very interested because I worked for my dad at various times.  As influential as he was in terms of my career development, actually my mother had a huge amount to do with one of the biggest steps I ever took in terms of how my work has evolved, and that is, I went into the food business not with my father, but with my mother.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Tell me about that.\n\nBaum:  In the early eighties, my mom had started a business with her very, very close friend Florence Aaron, and they had started to make—they had a mustard.  They were starting to make condiments.  My mother got real serious about this business, and I got really interested in it and I really wanted to do something with her at that time.  So I joined her, and then my brother came in on the business for a while.  So for about three and a half years we had a business called Life Spice.\n\nQ:  At what point in your education was this?\n\nBaum:  Oh, I was an old person by then.  I was a mother.  I was way out of school.\n\nQ:  Where, in fact, did you go to school?\n\nBaum:  Cornell, as my dad did, as one of my brothers went.  My daughter went (not my son).  There’s just a whole family line.  My husband went.  We all went to Cornell.\n\nQ:  But in the ordinary arts and sciences or in the cultural—\n\nBaum:  This was a very big point of contention in the family.  I wanted to go to the hotel school.  My father did not want me to go to the hotel school.  He wanted me to have a liberal arts education.  He felt very, very strongly about that.  And I was really interested, so I went into arts and sciences.\n\tThen after that, I was really interested in back of the house—what I neglected to tell you is that, I mean, amongst other things, about my grandparents.  My grandparents, my father’s parents, were in the hotel business.  So they had a big hotel until the early sixties in Saratoga Springs.  They owned it for fifty years.  That’s where my dad and his siblings really grew up.  Especially during the summer season, they were in Saratoga.\n\nQ:  What was the name of it?\n\nBaum:  The Hotel Gross & Baum.  It was a kosher hotel, and there was a big dining room.  My grandfather was like the front of the house, and my grandmother was the back of the house, and she ran the kitchen, she ran the dining room, she ran the housekeeping.  My grandfather took care of the guests and my grandmother—and there was another brother that was involved, too, I guess, in the business office there, another brother of my grandmother’s.\n\tBut I was so influenced.  I mean, some of my fondest memories, strongest memories, are from crazy things at the hotel in the summers when we used to go up there, because my dad would stick us all in the car, and we had to go several times.  Then I guess it would finish at a Jewish holidays when they would be closing, and then they would leave.  My grandparents would go to Florida by that time in the winter.\n\tBut not only did they have like this giant kitchen in the hotel, but one of the houses on the property was the corner house, and that’s where the family lived, and there was another kitchen there.  But in the hotel there was the walk-in, and I spent a lot of time as a kid, I remember so clearly, being in the walk-in, and the smells and the barrels coleslaw and pickles.  So that’s like totally in my blood.\n\nQ:  For the purposes of this project, why don’t you explain what a walk-in is.\n\nBaum:  The walk-in, it’s a big commercial refrigerator that you literally walk into, and then hopefully the light goes on when the door closes behind you, because it’s very frightening that you think you’ll never get out.  I used to follow my grandmother in and out, and also my father, because then he’d come for visits.\nI don’t think I had any particular interest that was different from another kid; it’s just that I grew up in it.  It was very much part of me, and then when I went through college, there was something in the back of my mind.  I actually went to Europe and went to Paris, and I thought, you know, I think I’d really like to get involved in the back of the house, but it was a pretty tough time.\n\nQ:  As a what?  As a cook?\n\nBaum:  Yes.  It was a pretty tough time for women in the restaurant business then, and I felt that I wasn’t getting the support and encouragement I really needed at that time from my own family.  In retrospect, it’s so strange because I really consider myself quite outspoken, but it really influenced me.  I really felt at that time that my father did not support that.  I couldn’t get past that.\n\nQ:  Did you know why?\n\nBaum:  I think it’s because of what I’m talking about, is because of kitchen politics, and my father, as I was growing up, had definite boundaries about what was his business and what was not appropriate for us to be part of.\nSo in 1964, for the World’s Fair, for example, I wanted to work at the World’s Fair.  My dad got me a job interview with some other company.  It was like that was so strange to me, but it was all about Joe having boundaries that eventually were broken down, but at that time he didn’t—I don’t know.  Maybe it was just me, but my brother Charles broke through earlier than I did.  He worked for the company as a teenager.\n\nQ:  Were there different boundaries for you as a girl, do you think?\n\nBaum:  Maybe.  [laughs]  I hate to say that, but it may be true.  I actually see that that had a huge influence on me and that the way I finally cobbled my way through to build my own career in food had a lot to do with doors not opening when I thought they should have.  It’s true of anybody, though, these turns in the path.  My whole relationship to the food business and the restaurant business and the food industry is something really different that I really carved out, because I felt that there wasn’t a space for me there in a way that, at least in my own thinking, my own constructs, wanted it to be.\n\nQ:  Tell me about Life Spice and what you did with your mother and Florence Aaron.\n\nBaum:  With Life Spice, I fell in love with food production and I was in charge of production.  So what that meant was I was in charge of helping develop the recipes, which were turned into formula, real formulations.  We worked with the consultant to help us scale up.  I was responsible for finding the factory lines.  We had to produce in a food factory.\n\nQ:  And these were spices?\n\nBaum:  These were a line of condiments, sauces and dressings, and we had, I guess, six products.  I would have to go negotiate with the factories.  They wanted to co-pack, you know, where they would take your recipe and then bring you the finished product at the door, but I didn’t want that.  I wanted to be on the line.  I wanted to be working with the people who were making the food, and I wanted to oversee it.  So I just fell in love with food production.  I really liked it.  I thought I could never cook the same thing twice, you know, the way I cook them, but with something like that, you had to cook the same thing twice.  You had to cook it the same time thousands of time for consistency’s sake, and then that became the whole craft to me, was trying to continue to go for the same tastes.  My mother was doing the marketing and the PR and stuff like that, and we did a book.\n\nQ:  What was that called?\n\nBaum:  It was the Life Spice Cookbook.  It was a breakthrough product in the sense that it was made without salt and without sugar, and so part of its marketing was based on that, that it was really salt-free, and that was just at the moment when there was this interest in and awareness about all the sodium in processed foods.  So my mother and her friend Florence got very interested in showing that you could do it and it could still be really flavorful, and they wanted to meet that challenge.  So then I came in and helped my mother really fulfill her vision of what she wanted to do.\nIt was a crossover product in that we marketed it to the brand-new kinds of supermarkets that were coming in there, which were like this combination of fancy food store and supermarket that they had in Washington as well as in New York and Boston and all the big cities, but we were also selling to the specialty food stores and the natural food stores.  So we were breaking through in a couple of areas.  That’s where I learned all about food marketing and the supermarket industry and how unfriendly it is to the small producer.  So that had enormous influence on me.\n\tEventually, without coming up with a whole lot of reinvestment into the company, we decided to discontinue for a variety of reasons.  My mother and I had different visions of how to do the business.  I wanted to have one of these tiny little white trucks that said Life Spice on the outside, where I could take it from my own little factory and drop it off at my little store route like in New York City.  I really wanted that, and that was not my mother’s vision at all of the kind of company she wanted to run.  So that was one of the reasons that we kind of discontinued it.\n\tBut then I understood that that was a value of the authentic farmers’ market, because it gave the producer an opportunity to sell directly to the consumer without having to pay twenty gazillion middlemen, and you could tell your own story to your consumer, because our story was a complicated story, and it wasn’t something that was going to sell itself on the shelves, which is another reason we had to really discontinue it.\n\nQ:  At the New School panel, you spoke about going with Jim Beard in Paris, I think, to markets.  You were younger, so you must have been going to France with your family.\n\nBaum:  Well, yes, and I was also there on my own, but I did go on this one trip with my family where we went to rendezvous with him at Les Halles.\n\nQ:  At the market.\n\nBaum:  At the market, and at the crazy famous bistro where some of the people eat the tripe soup and some of the people eat the onion soup, which is another story.  But anyway, yes.\n\nQ:  But did you know him at that point before?\n\nBaum:  Well, sure, because I had known about him and he had been to my home.\n\nQ:  Noticeably.  [laughs]\n\nBaum:  Yes.  I knew all about him and I knew to be incredibly thrilled to be there with that person at that place at that moment in history with my father.  It was very, very significant.\n\nQ:  Even then you were aware of that?\n\nBaum:  Yes, I was aware of that, because I knew the market, I think, was ripped down shortly after that.  I must have been reading at the same time, because one of the books that really influenced me a lot was Delights & Prejudices, and I was just realizing that the copyright, I think, is ’64.  So that’s my coming of age of all of this, really, because I was just at the end of high school.\n\nQ:  Is this copy that you have now the original copy of it?\n\nBaum:  Yes.  So this really influenced me a lot, and there’s a whole discussion in here about markets.  I don’t know literally if I read it before I was there with him or what, but it was just around this time when there was this expanding consciousness about food and where it was coming from, and I knew that my dad played a huge role in this, but I knew that Beard did too.  So ’64, ’65, well, that’s when they did the crazy Gas Pavilion Restaurant at the World’s Fair.  That was one of the first presentations of American regional menus, and also that’s when they must have been working on the project in the Midwest with Bradley Ogden of the American Festival Restaurant, and I was actually there in Kansas City recently.\n\nQ:  Let’s just go back to Les Halles for a minute.  You actually walked around the marketplace wit him?\n\nBaum:  Yes.\n\nQ:  What was that like?\n\nBaum:  Well, it was a really long time ago, but I remember being in these areas where all the cured meats were.  Somehow that really stuck in my mind, you know, like these vast displays of cured meats and certainly cheeses, and there would have been produce too.  But I do remember the enormity of it and understanding that that was there to supply restaurants, you know, that market happened in the middle of the night because it was there to supply restaurants and retail and all of that.  So I got it.  I understood about how food came to the city and how food came to the table and the different steps along the way, but I remember also being completely awestruck by the scale of it.  I’d never been in anything like that before.  After that, and even in my career, believe me, I’ve been in plenty of wholesale markets.  In fact, there’s a whole opening happening tomorrow in a project that I’ve been really involved with here in New York City.\n\nQ:  What is that?\n\nBaum:  Well, now they’re calling it Greenmarket Wholesale, or the Wholesale Greenmarket, I think it’s called.  But it’s at Hunts Point, and it’s really the first major step in the revitalization of the New York City Wholesale Farmers’ Market.\n\nQ:  How have you been involved in it?\n\nBaum:  I was on the advisory committee.  What we haven’t gotten to yet is the fact that I’ve worked with Bob.  I worked with Bob a long time ago.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you explain who he is again.\n\nBaum:  Bob Lewis, who is now special assistant to the Commissioner of the Department of Ag and Markets for New York State was the co-founder of the Greenmarket program, and after, I guess, a year or so of founding or co-founding Greenmarket, then he moved to the state agency and developed a whole direct marketing area for New York State.\n\tSo after my mother and I decided to close the business, I wrote Bob a letter and said, “Bob, I’ve lived upstate New York.  I understand what’s going on with agriculture.  I know how important the markets are for the farmers, but also markets are really important for small-scale producers like I just was.  I know that if I could have sold my product in Greenmarket, I would have had a completely different kind of business.  I know what it’s about, and I really want to support it, and I want to get involved.”  I told him about my food background and what could I do.\nI think he was very excited that I had actually been in the food production business for like three years and I knew about marketing and sourcing and all of that stuff, so he immediately was able to make a connection, because there was somebody else in New York City who needed somebody to come and work and help them get a market development project off the ground.\n\nQ:  This was when?\n\nBaum:  This was in 1985.  It actually was right around the time when Jim Beard died.  It must have been right after he died, because shortly before he died—I might have spoken about this, but one of the things that I did, which was so meaningful to me, was I took my parents’ car and I went and I picked him up at his brownstone and I took him.  We were going to go to the market together.  I took him to the Union Square farmers’ market.\n\nQ:  How spectacular.\n\nBaum:  Right before he died.  So I took him over there and we were walking around together, and it was like unbelievable.  Everybody was coming to greet him, including the manager of the market, so that was like a huge deal and it was so meaningful to me.  We shopped together.  We walked the market together, shopped together, and then, of course, I brought him home.  I had this whole relationship with him through my dad and then also separately through my mother, and he helped us with our ideas about our business and about our cookbook and contributed some recipes.  So I had my own relationship with him, which was really special.\n\nQ:  Where would these contacts take place, on the phone, at his house?\n\nBaum:  Many times at his house, but also he used to come to my parents’ weekend home when I was in college, which would have been around the time we traveled in Europe together too.  He played a big role in starting this insane tradition in my family, was that he wound up with Black Forest cake in his face.  I think it must have been his birthday or something.  For the weekend, he was at my parents’ home, and he got a cake in the face, and the cakes were coming fast and furious.\n\tEvery weekend, Albert Stockli, you see, who was my dad’s chef for many, many years in the beginning of the RA empire, and he was the first chef at the Four Seasons, he had an inn in Connecticut and he would drive over.  It was a big joke because he kept bringing these Black Forest cakes.  It was a gag.  And my father and he and my dad, they were like big practical jokers.  So as part of an extension of this, it happened, and Beard got this cake in the face.  Well, after that, it became a family tradition whether Jim Beard was there or not, and it went on for many, many, many years.\n\nQ:  How did he react to that, the cake in the face?\n\nBaum:  He laughed.  Everybody laughed.  It was like so outrageous, and the fact that my dad would do it was, like, it was perfect.  It was really great.  So, yes, there was a lot of joking, a lot of gagging.  And my mother was very mischievous and she was in on a lot of it.\n\nQ:  Could you describe, so far as you knew it, the relationship between Beard and your father and Beard and your mother?\n\nBaum:  I knew that Joe and Jim, they conferred, but I didn’t realize until a bit later how long that relationship really lasted and all the different projects they worked on together.  So I think it was a relationship that spanned at least thirty years of colleagues and some kind of paid relationship as well.  So I think that Beard had a huge influence on Joe.\n\nQ:  In terms of what?\n\nBaum:  Well, in terms of his sensibilities about food and about all the menu development and also some of the conceptual stuff, I would assume also.  But my dad was running the three-ring circus.  He was the impresario.  He was pulling all the pieces together.  But Beard was pretty close in, I think, to the core, and there were a few other people who were too.  There was a time when there was just this incredible creative outburst of restaurant after restaurant after restaurant.  So now I look back and I understand a lot more about Beard’s development and the relationship there and the relationship around the food.\n\nQ:  Which had to do with fresh farm product or what?\n\nBaum:  Well, it had to do with a certain sensibility about freshness and about seasonality and about a certain kid of simplicity, I think, and that was very ingredient-driven, but also there was this concept of tradition, too, I think, in terms of American food and this whole idea about regionality that became also a very big theme for both of them and projects that they did together.  So it was a complex thing.  I’m not really an historian.  It’s only through a child’s eyes, believe me, but when I go back and read some Beard stuff, recipes and discussions, I can really see.\nJim loved to tease my father, because I think there were times when my father’s palate was—he was very adventurous, let’s put it that way.  He was really adventurous and could probably eat any kind of pickle, or something like that.  [laughs]  But Jim had his limits, you know.  But Joe was like pretty broad, let’s put it that way.  And he used to laugh at Joe sometimes about what my father would eat.  But, I mean, obviously there was a tremendous respect and a great deal of conviviality as well in the relationship.  He was a friend, too, so he’d been invited and accepted invitation to Passover Seder at my house.  I had the nerve to invite him to come to my Seder.\n\nQ:  When was this?\n\nBaum:  This would be in the mid-eighties.  But, unfortunately, that’s when his health was really very, very up and down.  I mean, I even had my dining room painted because he was coming.  But at the last minute, he actually couldn’t make it.  He was in the hospital.\n\nQ:  Let’s go back to Bob Lewis.\n\nBaum:  Bob directed me to meet with this guy, and the guy hired me.  So for a year I was really—\n\nQ:  This guy, what was his job?\n\nBaum:  I really don’t want to name him.\n\nQ:  No, but it’s the job that’s more important.\n\nBaum:  The job was he was the head of a downtown development group, let’s put it that way, in a part of the city.  I was like a consultant to them for a year, working on this market development concept and the restaurants for it and writing RFPs because I had done that.  I worked in Central Park for a while and worked with Betsy Barlow and was involved with the concessions in Central Park.  So I knew how to do those things, and so I worked with them for a year.\nThen at that time, I also was helping them with their—they had a farmers’ market.  So I got really involved in planning special events and working with those farmers and other people in the community, and that’s when I really learned how to operate a market, because I worked there for a year.  They opened their farmers’ market a year before Greenmarket started, actually, in Manhattan.  This was in Jamaica, Queens.\n\nQ:  Who was the director?\n\nBaum:  It was under the umbrella of this downtown development group.  So then the year ended, and I called Bob and said, “Hey, Bob, my contract’s over.  What am I going to do now?  Do you have any way for me to continue with this work?”\n\tAnd he said, “Oh, there’s been hiring a freeze.  The only thing I have is an intern line.  Do you want it?”\n\tAnd I said, “Yes.”  So I probably was the oldest intern they ever had.  [laughs]  So I worked in Bob’s office and we researched state support for farmers’ markets all over the country, and I did the first survey of farmers’ markets and their state support when I was working with Bob, so that was like in ’85 or something like that, ’86.  We were trying to get a handle on what was going on all over the country so we could also see what we were trying to do in New York from this overall perspective.\n\tI became an expert on farmers’ markets because I had done this survey, much of which was conducted, actually, by phone.  I had to find the right person in every single state to tell me how many markets they had and if they were wholesale markets or retail markets and if there was any legislation supporting what they were doing.  So we had to amass this incredible knowledge about this.\n\tThen after a while, I was asked to join Project for Public Spaces, and I was the founding director there of what’s still called the Public Market Collaborative.  So that’s when I started working on conferences, really.  I came in as the first public market conference was being planned, which was held at Pike Place Market in 1987.\n\nQ:  Who ran the Project for Public Spaces?\n\nBaum:  Fred Kent.  He still does.  In fact, Joe and Mike were on their board, but it had nothing to do with my being there, I have to say, as much as my father influenced me.  It was always do it for yourself, kind of, in terms of making my way in my work.\n\tAnyway, so Fred hired me, and it was like a huge step for me, because I had this program to direct, we were writing a big grant to HUD, and we then did consulting all over the country on public market halls as well as open-air farmers’ markets, got involved with wholesale markets and worked on the Dallas Farmers' Market, and we started to work on this book called Public Markets and Community Revitalization that I’m a co-author of, that was published in the mid-nineties.\n\tDuring that time, we did the Pike Place conference.  Then we did another conference in New Orleans in 1991, which was an international conference on public markets, and then right shortly after that, my colleague and I left Project for Public Spaces and we founded Public Market Partners in 1991, and we continued doing a lot of this work all over the country.\n\nQ:  What was the attitude toward public markets around that time?\n\nBaum:  Well, a lot of public markets had disappeared.\n\nQ:  You mean the really old ones?\n\nBaum:  Yes, the market halls.  Pike Place had come through this enormous decline and rebirth, and that’s why this conference was being held there, was to really celebrate Pike Place Market and learn from their experience.  Pike Place was the place where people would go to understand the potential of the public market that included a farmers’ market.  It wasn’t exclusively a farmers’ market.  It was this mix of farmers and purveyors and small food businesses and restaurants and wholesale and retail and a variety of related businesses, which really created a market district.\n\tSo, anyway, Ted and I—he was a former partner—he and I did a lot of the writing for this book, and we also did this book with Project for Public Spaces, and it’s still one of the authoritative books.  It’s really written for sponsors of markets and people interested in defending them.\n\nQ:  We take this kind of thing for granted now, but in the early nineties that must have been pretty groundbreaking.\n\nBaum:  It was.  It was very groundbreaking work.\n\nQ:  Did your friends connected to all of this not understand what you were doing, care about what you were doing?\n\nBaum:  Yes, I think they cared about what I was doing.  My kids could never understand what I did then or what I do now.  [laughs]  That was a big joke.  But what was happening at the same time, and it’s now documented by the USDA, is where there’s this explosion.  We were there in the really beginning.  We were doing this work and documenting this work as it was just taking off.  Bob was one of the key figures, with Barry Benepe, on the city and regional level and then on the state level and now on the national scene.  So his influence is just gigantic in terms of this.\n\tI was there at the beginning to really help us get our arms around what was going on, and so also we could talk about it, and we could promote it, and we could really, in a way, protect it and see its role in protecting local agriculture, which I was very dedicated to because of my experience living in the country and seeing the disappearance of farmland in Delaware County, what was going on with the dairy herds and the decline of the dairy industry.\nSo that really affected me, and when I came back to New York then, I could really see the role that markets could play in helping to stabilize that.  So I saw markets from a lot of different perspectives, but also as somebody who is totally and utterly mesmerized by the beauty of the product that’s coming in, as a cook and as somebody who has some knowledge about production both in terms of growing but also in terms of processing.  So then you know what happens in the finished plate in a restaurant and blah, blah, blah.  All of that stuff is stuff that I’ve been completely seeped in all my life, so my passion for markets comes from a really, really deep place, and it drives me today in the work that I continue to do, even though it has a different twist to what we’re doing now.\n\tIn the early and mid-nineties was when this thing started to really expand, and it’s still expanding today.  So every year there are more farmers’ markets in, let’s say, New York City and New York State.  I think there are like, I don’t know, you’d have to ask Bob, but there must be at least three-hundred-something markets in the state now and about a hundred markets in New York City, I guess a little bit more than half of which are sponsored and operated by the Greenmarket program.  But there are all these other sponsors who have begun programs because the markets have so many benefits and values to offer to both urban and rural.  So markets are really a win-win situation, but the market hall is a much more difficult beast than the periodic open-air market.  It’s much more difficult.  It’s much more expensive.  It’s harder for something like that to survive in a state that is how it was meant to be, if you know what I mean.\n\nQ:  When I first got involved in following this, I don’t know, maybe five or six years ago, I became aware that each of the individual states was also tracking the growth of the markets or the rebirth of the old market halls and how they were used either as market spaces or non-market spaces, but it was interesting me that by then things were online and that you could, in fact, follow the development.\n\nBaum:  Well, a lot of that is from the work that—I mean, honestly, it’s work that Bob and I started together and then was continued through the early nineties, which I was very involved with.  So I really think that I feel sort of like a grandma of a lot of this, even though, I mean, it was happening simultaneously.  It was like this thing happening all over.  It was this consciousness that really picked up really, really fast.  People were so ready for it.  But they weren’t ready for it in the beginning, but I think by the nineties it really started to really, really take off.\n\nQ:  What were your parents’ reactions to what you were doing?\n\nBaum:  Well, they were interested.  They were certainly interested in what I was doing.  I’m sure on a certain level, I know they were tremendously interested.  A running theme with me always was how involved I was going to try to be with my father’s business, but here I was, I had totally my own identity out in this crazy world of farming, food and farming.  Like what’s that about, you know?  So it was definitely a new place to be, but I was totally supported by my parents in that work, and they certainly understood the value of it to the community as well as on an individual level, and it was very fulfilling for me.  So I know that that was a good thing as far as my family was concerned.\n\nQ:  What was this thing your father formed for the forum on the future series?\n\nBaum:  Before I tell you that, I want to tell you one thing.  When they opened the World Trade Center and they started on the ground floor with the Market Bar & Grill and the big kitchen and this place called Eat & Drink, they had to get people to go there.  They had to do special events on the concourse.  So what was the first thing my dad did?  The second Greenmarket.  He invited Greenmarket to set up.  He had a farmers’ market inside, which, I guess, has since grown.  And moved outside the Trade Center.  So it’s just so interesting, because when they built the Trade Center, a lot of that whole area, they had to displace the markets from down there.\nSo part of his concept for the Market Bar & Grill was to hold some of that history in on the ground floor in that restaurant and in that place, and so that’s one of the reasons that the farmers’ market was there and why there was all this recognition, not for the producers on the menu, but the purveyors.  So they had a standard menu where they listed the purveyors, and they would write the specials that came from that purveyor.  Every day or every week, that would be brought to everybody, or on the big board was the purveyor and the name of the meat company and like that was completely new, completely new.\n\nQ:  How long did that last, the market?\n\nBaum:  That restaurant?\n\nQ:  No, the markets inside the building.\n\nBaum:  I don’t know.  I’m not really sure how long it lasted and when it moved outside.  I really don’t know the exact history of that, but I forgot that that was very significant, so that was so much a part of my dad’s consciousness in terms of what he was doing.  I don’t think I knew it then.  I didn’t know that till way after, the connection.\n\tAfter I had been in my own business for a while and I had been consulting all over the country and then started operating markets in New York City, I operated a market in the South Bronx and also in East Harlem for years.  Actually, before I moved on from that, I had started to work and I wanted to really work for my dad.  So we did an analysis for him, my partner and I, of the percentage of fresh produce that they were bringing in.  We tried to trace either how much they had that was local or how they could improve their sourcing so they could have more local food.\n\nQ:  “They” being the Trade Center restaurants?\n\nBaum:  Yes, but also the Rainbow Room.  So I got very involved in looking at these numbers and working with people in his controller’s office.  I was very fascinated by this.  So I thought it made more sense for me, instead of being out on the street trying to pull the customers to the farmers, because that’s what I thought I was doing by operating these markets, I really saw that, that I really wanted to do more work for farmers, but nobody could pay me.  I actually done some marketing jobs for the Watershed Ag Council and with the farmer, did an incredibly great campaign.  But to continue to do that work, I thought I was better off if I could convince my dad to hire me so that I could pull product into the restaurants instead of pulling people to the food out on the street.\nSo I went back to work for him part-time the last couple years of his life, just when he was opening—I was there when they opened Windows the second time.  It was during that time that he was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the CIA, and there was a lot of fundraising that was done in his honor to benefit the endowment funds at the CIA but also to start a program called—it was supposed to be like a think-tank program--the Joe Baum Forum on the Future.\n\nQ:  And what were they thinking about?\n\nBaum:  Well, they were going to decide what they were going to think about.  They created this shell.\n\tSo one of the special projects I worked on with my dad, because I still wasn’t going to ever wind up in the back of the house except as the produce police, as they called me, was to work on the Forum of the Future.  So I worked on it intensely with him, doing a lot of research about the topics and what it could look like, what the format could look like, would it be a one-day thing, would it be a series of small talks, bringing people together, things that would be of importance to the restaurant industry.\n\tI worked closely with Irena Chalmers at that time, who was a consultant to my father, and some other people.  We worked on it for about a year and a half when my dad got very, very ill.  This was in conjunction with the CIA.  I wanted this thing to take place at the CIA and he really wanted to have it at Windows.  He wanted to have it in the restaurant.  We used to have these gigantic arguments about all of this, and, unfortunately, he died before we could do the first one.\n\tHowever, I was so deeply into this and I so believed that this could happen and we could do something really significantly, that I went to the CIA myself and with my mother, actually.  So it wasn’t really totally myself, but we did it together, and said we’d like to continue this program in Joe’s name.\n\nQ:  How did you describe what the program was?\n\nBaum:  Well, they knew what it was.  They were all involved in these conversations about what it might be, but we hadn’t put the pin in it.  We hadn’t really formulated exactly if it was going to be on all different topics.  Irena was really hot on it should be about the water supply, and there were other things that I felt were really pressing, whether it was about what was going on with the fisheries or other things that really came to bear in the restaurant setting as well.\n\tBut by the time I could really follow up on the CIA with this and they had agreed to go forward, and we were going to do it up there, because I pushed hard, I wanted to do it there, because I really wanted it to be an academic atmosphere.  It wasn’t really academic, but I really wanted it to be in an educational setting.  I’m sure I would have lost if my father had still been alive, but, anyway.  So what they did was they said, “Okay, we’ll do it here, and this is the person you’re going to work with, this person.”  Who is this person?  It’s Ann Cooper.  So Ann and I planned the first Forum on the Future and then we right into planning.  We did two in a row, and they were successful, but they were very controversial, also, for the CIA.\n\nQ:\tBecause of the subject matter?\n\nBaum:  Yes.  There was a lot of debate going on, and there was also movements about what constituted healthier eating, what did that mean in terms of where things were being sourced and also how things were being presented and the percentage of meat to other things on the plate, and things of that nature.\nSo, anyway, to make a long story short, I decided to take my program away from the CIA and try to do it on my own.  So I brought the program to New York with the encouragement of both Michael Batterberry—primarily Michael Batterberry really convinced me to do this, and he said, “You know, you really should talk to my friend Dorothy Hamilton.”  So we did, I did, and got into a very good business relationship with her and was able to hold the first Baum Forum in New York City in 2002.  Thank God I had taken time off and I decided not to do it in 2001.  I didn’t have time, and it would have been in September 2001.\n\nQ:  So it was held—\n\nBaum:  It was held in September of 2002.\n\nQ:  At—\n\nBaum:  It was held in Lower Manhattan.  I held it in Lower Manhattan in particular because of what had happened, trying to bring business back to Lower Manhattan, and I had it in a variety of venues, and it was gigantic.\n\nQ:  Was this with Dorothy Hamilton?\n\nBaum:  Yes, she was basically a partner in the crazy, gigantic—this was a humongous conference.\n\nQ:  The first subject was what?\n\nBaum:  No, it’s multi subjects, like the other two had been.  It was everything.  But I had all the top names.  Those three conferences, you know, it was a who’s who of people in sustainability as it related to food and agriculture.\n\nQ:  That was the general overall theme?\n\nBaum:  Oh, yes, it’s always been the theme.  So I had Michael Pollan twice.  I had Gary Hirshberg.  I had Alice Waters twice.  I had Judy Wicks.  I mean, really, it’s a very, very long list of people who are very well known now, and they were just on the rise.  Some of them were quite well known then and others were on the rise.\n\tThen after that, after I did my third one, I was like exhausted, and so I decided to do smaller-scale programs, and I started doing programs, after a brief hiatus, at the CUNY Graduate Center with a very, very good friend and colleague who was the director then of public program and continuing education.  Then I did a whole series on ingredients and sustainability, and then I started cobbling together these classes on food systems planning, the first ones that were taught in that kind of a setting.  That was just when Pratt was just starting.  People were just starting to look at food systems planning, like at Pratt.\n\nQ:  So when would that have been?\n\nBaum:  Oh, gosh.  This was like 2003 and ‘04, something like that.\n\nQ:  I ask you that in part because I’m interested in how the conversation about all of this has changed, and when, to your knowledge, more of the general public started to be interested in, well, even knew what food systems were.\n\nBaum:  How did that happen?  Well, it was around the time we started the Food Systems Network, so a lot of the learning about that actually came from Bob and other people.  So there were people really, like me, who had very broad perspective about different parts of food production and food marketing, and other people who were involved in the sort of nutrition end of things.  There were a bunch of people who had actually been in the restaurant business who did these career changes, like Fern Estrow and other people who went into the more sort of community-health-oriented aspects of food, and then other people involved in the emergency food system.\n\nQ:  Again, why don’t you describe what the Food Systems Network was when you conceived it.\n\nBaum:  Well, I wasn’t actually an early conceptualizer of it specifically, but I went to like the first meeting or the second meeting, so I was in there in the very beginning.  But it was an idea that had grown up, that was sort of coming to the forefront through some other people, and it was also related to this brand-new movement called the Food Policy Council movement.  But what we wanted to do was to bring people together who were involved in different aspects of the food system.  It’s the same thing we always said, it’s to foster collaboration and to foster activism and to really develop a voice and to make sure that there was a relationship between all the food that the farmers had to sell and all the people who were in New York City who could partake of that food at any income level.  So from my perspective as having one foot really in that perspective from the region, from my experience living upstate and doing all that market work, but also then understanding the community aspects of it from down here, to me, Food Systems Network was a way to bring a lot of these things together. \n\tThen since then, of course, a lot of very interesting projects have evolved, and now one of the things that I’m so interested in, first of all, is introducing young people to food and farming and food systems, in terms of their understanding of the world, but also so they can effect positive change in terms of the food systems and the conventional food industry, but also that it’s a path for tremendous reward in terms of work.  So with my forums, what started to happen was, I got really interested in the School Food Revolution and decided to do a very small program, which was sold out.  Then I did a conference.\n\nQ:  When was that?\n\nBaum:  This was—oh, gosh, I’m going to have to look at my website.  But my first School Food Revolution Conference was when I was still at CUNY.\n\nQ:  Okay, I’ll check that date.\n\nBaum:  I have it right in here.  Then that sold out.  That was like three or four hundred people who wanted to talk about the School Food Revolution.\n\tBut then I had to change venues again, and I had to move from CUNY because there were changes at the Graduate Center, and I developed the next two conferences with my colleagues in the nutrition department at Teachers College.  They were collaborators for two years.  The first one, I just did it on my own, really, at CUNY, and then the next two were at Teachers College on the School Food Revolution, which included gardening and related projects and perspectives and so forth.\n\tWith the last two conferences there, we made a big point to get young people to come and do some presenting work and talk about also what it meant to them to be involved in this work.  So at the end of my second conference at Teachers College, I was listening to the final closing panel of these young people and their mentors, and I just said, “That’s it.  I’m not doing these conferences anymore unless I’m working with youth, and I want to teach youth how to do these conferences.  They can do their own conferences, but I’m not going to do any more talking heads.” \n\tI’m a grandmother and I have young grandchildren, and I thought, you know, this is for them.  This has to be about the future and about them.  So then I got this idea that I wanted to really work with youth, and then evolved into the Youth Forum we did last year in conjunction with the New York City Food and Fitness Partnership, where 90 percent of the people who attended the forum—and there about five hundred people—were under twenty-five years old.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nBaum:  So we so surpassed our goal.  We had youth doing the presentations.  It was peer-led workshops.  We had exhibitors who had opportunities to offer youth in food farming and active living, whether they were mentorships, internships, or actual jobs, and we had some really stirring performances at the end.  It was just enormous.  We worked with a group of youth, a changing group of youth.  Six weeks before the actual conference, we had kids involved in planning the actual conference and then they worked the day of the conference.  So we carried them along and worked with them on a creative level as well as an operational level.\n\nQ:  How did you find them?\n\nBaum:  We recruited them through the Food and Fitness Partnership, through Food Systems Network, and through some one-on-one contacts that we had.  I had two twenty-five-year-olds working for me on the project team, and one of them in particular was a specialist in youth development and had worked with a lot of these kids.  So it was a very, very specific ask for young people, but the response we got was overwhelming.  We never thought we’d get so many kids.  We’d have forty young people and their mentors at every single planning meeting.  It was unbelievable.  So it really hit a nerve, and it was of really great interest.\n\nQ:  Do you have any thoughts on why so many kids have responded generally to this movement, why they’re interested in it?\n\nBaum:  I think it’s like a whole lot of reasons.  Some of them are interested in it because it gives them some control in their own life, in terms of their own bodies and their own health, and they really understand the connections.  Other kids got into it because they could get internships, they could get jobs doing it, and then they got really interested in it.  I think there’s a great deal of respect that’s awarded these kids who get involved with it, so I think that there’s a lot of give-and-take in terms of this work, that it gave kids something really constructive to talk to their neighbors about.  There’s incredible conversations that go on across the farmers’ market table, and I think there’s great joy in growing food and cooking food, and the kids are enjoying it.  So I think it’s really a combination of things, but I really think that it’s such a positive and constructive thing, and it’s become really rewarding for a lot of kids on a lot of different levels.  But some kids have tremendous challenges because their home life does not value it in the same way or their—\n\nQ:  Or supportive.\n\nBaum:  Yes.  So a lot of times there are going to be kids teaching at home as well as in the community, which is pretty extraordinary, and these kids feel a lot of responsibility and a lot of accomplishment by doing it.  So as a component in youth development, it’s tremendously successful in addition to its other values.\n\nQ:  How have your own children responded to your work and your interests?\n\nBaum:  My grandchildren or my children?\n\nQ:  Your own children.\n\nBaum:  Well, both of my children are really involved in the food and restaurant business at the moment.  [laughs]  So our daughter and son-in-law just opened a local market or grocery and café in West Philly, which has a very established culture of local food and good food in West Philadelphia, but they’re doing tremendous work right now.  I mean, their local stuff is like flying off the shelves, their dairy, their meats, their local cheeses.  They’re doing really extremely well.  I’m extremely, really, really proud of them.  They took this giant leap by opening this business.  It’s only two weeks old, and it’s really filling a need not only in the residential community, but it’s filling a need in the community of producers.  They’re reordering from these tiny producers who have never seen orders the way they’ve been able to place them, so that’s really, really exciting.\n\nQ:  That’s very exciting.\n\nBaum:  And our son, well, of the two of them, he’s the one that actually has been trained as a sous chef.  He’s not cooking, but he works.  He’s a liaison between a company that owns a well-known brand of a high-end chain of restaurants, and he’s the liaison between the brand owner and all their new construction sites.  So our son is project manager, but he’s totally involved in developing restaurants.\nBoth my kids were close to my parents, but my son in particular was very, very influenced, I think, and very close to my dad, and actually did a big report on Joe and his restaurants for one of his college courses at Syracuse, but really takes to the world of restaurant development.  He has back-of-the house experience as well as this other work that he does, so it’s very, very interesting.  So both the kids right now are totally involved.\n\nQ:  What’s next for you now?\n\nBaum:  Well, that’s a good question.  I’m actually getting more and more involved on a more and more local level in my own community.  I was one of the founders of a CSA with Hawthorne Valley Farm here in Riverdale.  We are just finishing our fourteenth year.\n\nQ:  Of the CSA?\n\nBaum:  Of the CSA.  And we’re the first CSA in New York City to go year-round on local food, twelve months a year.  So we go six months of weekly deliveries in the summer and six months of monthly deliveries in the winter, and we’ve created a huge network of farms that we’re involved with here, but it’s also at Neighborhood House where we located our first youth market.  Working with Greenmarket, we opened a youth market at Neighborhood House.  So it’s the same location.  We have it on the same day as CSA.\n\nQ:  Neighborhood House is where?\n\nBaum:  It’s here in Riverdale.  Riverdale Neighborhood House.  It’s a settlement house.  This is a group of us in this community.  Then we convinced Greenmarket to open a second youth market down in Marble Hill, which is a very underserved neighborhood that’s immediately adjacent to Riverdale.\n\nQ:  Underserved in terms of access to fresh food?\n\nBaum:  Access to healthy local fresh food, and there’s all kinds of issues, health disparity issues, in Marble Hill.  What we did for both youth markets is employ kids from the community to staff them, and they’ve been just like tremendously, tremendously successful.  They’re also places of redemption for WIC coupons and EBT food stamps and all those things are coming to both of these markets, and these are places that didn’t have access to local food before.\n\tBut also in the community we’re looking to expand part of what we’re doing into possibly get involved with a project that would involve youth and seniors in creating healthy snacks for the after-school programs and the Senior Center.  So we’re going to probably start with some baked goods as a training, and hopefully we’ll get the funding to really become a supplier and distributor of healthy snacks that would include our becoming the buyers of local produce as well as other local products to qualify for the federal reimbursement for these programs.  So that’s a new project.\n\tSo it’s very interesting, because, in a sense, part of my focus right now is becoming more and more localized in terms of local food systems in my own community, and that was something that wasn’t really that—I mean, I was doing it, but not in a really focused way, so now I’m doing it in a more focused way.\n\tI’m very active in two organizations.  One is, of course, on the board of the Food Systems Network, NYC, but I’m also co-chair of an international committee for Les Dames d’Escoffier, which is called Green Tables.  So we’re trying to encourage and document similar kinds of projects that our members are involved with in twenty-seven chapters around the country and Canada.\n\nQ:  It sounds like you have a lot on your plate.\n\nBaum:  Yes, and the other thing that I’m trying to do very hard is, we donated my father’s papers and archive to the New York Public Library.\n\nQ:  What a great idea.\n\nBaum:  Yes.  So we’re hoping that’s going to become available to the public in a very short period of time.\n\nQ:  Thank you.  This has been so interesting and really informative.\n\nBaum:  I’m sure I skipped giant pieces, but I’m sure that’s plenty for you to go with.\n\nQ:  This is great.  This is really terrific.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBaum - 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n","description":"Hilary Baum is a pioneer in the movement to bring attention to problems and possibilities of the American food system, and New York in particular.

Fresh fruits and vegetables were limited to summertime roadside stands. To most urban dwellers, farmers were distant exotic creatures. It would be decades before words like local, seasonal, and organic became commonplace.\r\n\r\nBrought to life by Architect Barry Benepe and urban planner Robert Lewis, the Greemarket movement was a major development that helped to change that way of thinking. This movement initiated consumer appreciationâ€”and eventually demand forâ€”fresh food.\r\n\r\nAt the time, Benepe was the director of his own small firm and therefore not bound by traditional notions of architectural practice, allowing him to expand into unorthodox areas such as open space protection and farmland preservation. Lewis applied for a job at his firm. Together they saw the disconnect between the food to which New Yorkers had access in standard supermarkets, and the much fresher, higher quality food produced by area farmersâ€”and the possibility of bringing the two together. When they located an unused and vacant city lot behind Bloomingdales on Manhattan's Upper East Side, they jumpstarted the New York City Greenmarket movement.TTT\n\nInterviewee:  Barry Benepe\t\t\t\t\t\t                Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t        New York City\n\nDate:  June 25, 2009\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub, it’s the 25th of June 2009, and I am with Barry Benepe in his home in Greenwich Village.\n\tGood morning.\n\nBenepe:  Good morning.\n\nQ:  I’m hoping we can start, if you could tell me something about when and where you were born, and something about your parents and what your childhood was like.\n\nBenepe:  Well, I was born right here in New York City, and I lived on East Ninth Street off University Place.  In fact, Christopher Gray just wrote a piece about the building this past year, in which he looked up in the records and found out that my family lived there.  So he called me up to get some background on it.\nShortly after I was born, we moved to Gramercy Park, the family did.  I had an older brother, Bruce, who was then six and a half years older.  At the time my mother married my father in 1920, she was an illustrator, an artist, and he worked for a company called Leacock and Company, which was located at 230 Fifth Avenue, so he was able to walk to work.  The business centered around importing of linens, a lot of embroidered linens from places like India, France, Belgium and China.\nI went to school at Friends Seminary, and it was a short walk from Gramercy Park  to school on East 16th St.  In the fifth grade I was transferred to Browning School because my dad didn’t think I was paying enough attention in my subjects.  Too many girls in school, I guess.\n\nQ:  Where is Browning?\n\nBenepe:  Browning is still at 62nd in between Park and Madison Avenues.  I spent maybe three years there before moving on to St. Andrew’s School in Delaware, a boarding school.  And about that time, shortly before then, actually, in 1938, when I was ten, he purchased a farm in the Eastern Shore in Maryland.  In my family, my mother had been very devoted to food and cooking.  She spent a lot of time preparing interesting meals for guests, things like jellied aspics and things that didn’t interest me very much.  A lot of the cooking for me personally was done by a maid and butler, [Maria and Manuel], who lived in our house; they were both Portuguese, and prepared fairly simple meals, things like hamburgers and I’m not sure what else, but decent.  One of the things they prepared, [gnocchi]…., they would cook Cream of Wheat in milk and then let it harden and pan-fry it.  I don’t recall many highlights in those meals.  I think my mother was more the one to alert me to interesting foods.\n\tWhen we moved to Maryland….  We had our own vegetable garden in the back, as well as the farm itself, [produced vegetables]. Our food came from our back garden; though my mother did a lot with fresh vegetables, although she was mainly interested in flower gardening and did all her work in flowers.\n\nQ:  Did the family live half the time at the farm and half in New York?\n\nBenepe:  Yes.  Exactly.  My dad’s office was here in New York, so he came to the farm a good part of the summer.  Since he was president of the company, he could pretty much direct his own time.\n\nQ:  What made them buy the farm?\n\nBenepe:  That’s a very good question, and I don’t really know, and the reason he chose St. Andrew’s School was because it was halfway between New York and the farm.  He didn’t come from a farm background.  His family came from St. Paul, Minnesota, and he had a lot of brothers and sisters, I think about eight in all, and the brothers tended to gravitate into medicine.  I think he thought he would too, and he went to Columbia, but he said, the way he explained it to me, “I couldn’t memorize all the bones in the human skull, so I gave up on that as a future study.”\nHe entered the business as a result of World War I and being demobilized in England.  He went to the University of Dublin for a year.  It was something equivalent to a G.I. Bill, and it was while he was in England that he met Julian Leacock, who was looking for somebody to help him establish an office here in New York. The Leacock Brothers were divided into two families, [Julian was] doing the linens and  [Stephen producing wines] in Madeira.  \nWhy he bought the farm is an interesting question, and I don’t think I’ll ever know.  He was thinking maybe I would go to school in Maryland after he got the farm, if the schools there were really good enough.  I have a copy of a letter he wrote to his mother to ask if she would come and stay there on the farm while I went to school down there, but she turned him down.  She didn’t really want to leave Minnesota for that long a time.  So that’s one of the reasons why he picked St. Andrew’s, and so when they would be going to the farm, they’d pick me up on the way back to drive me.  Trains were still running.  I might have taken the train down there as well at times.\n\tSt. Andrew’s was a boys’ school then.  It was an Episcopal school that was founded by Felix du Pont with an endowment to keep it going to they could take a range of incomes, so that we had a really broad range of students.  But I would say that the exposure to farm food, plus my mother, did a lot to engrain me with the concept of where food comes from, more than any other experience.  As I grew older, I would begin to work more and more on the farm, and as I became a teenager and got my driver’s license, could drive loads of tomatoes to market and other foods to the auction market.\n\nQ:  Where would those markets have been?\n\nBenepe:  Princess Anne [county in Maryland] had an auction market, and I learned quite quickly that the auction market was not a true bidding process, but the two or three bidders who would sit there on the bench would collude with each other and take turns to suppress prices.\n\nQ:  Standard auction behavior.\n\nBenepe:  So farmers were very upset, and the canners weren’t much better.  To take a load of six hundred baskets of tomatoes to the cannery meant sitting in line for half a day, a long line of farmers waiting to unload, and meantime, these were in peek baskets which were stacked on top of each other in a staggered fashion, but the baskets were old and they’d begin to collapse under the weight, and there’d be juice all over the truck.  Canning tomatoes were generally very ripe tomatoes, the kind which were packed for eating were called Climax tomatoes, were picked earlier in the season while they were still partially green and put in these small quart baskets.  And they’d be shipped with a lid and much better protected.\n\tI tried to find out more about who was canning our tomatoes, and, in fact, I asked somebody [at the plant] what the label looked like so I could look for it in the store; it was some kind of innocuous name like Best Tomatoes, or something like that,  and later I would find  them [on the shelf] in the store so I could know what I was eating.  Campbell’s Soup eventually bought the cannery and they were more sophisticated.  They began to produce stewed tomatoes as well as canned tomatoes.  I went up above in the loft, where the women worked who were chopping peppers and onions and celery to make stewed tomatoes, and see how that process worked.  I was about sixteen at the time.  I had to be that old to be driving the truck.\n\nQ:  So the years were about when?\n\nBenepe:  This would have been—from 1938 through World War II to 1950 when I graduated from Williams College. \n\tIt was a pretty isolated life.  I had few friends.  When you’re on a two-hundred-acre farm, they’re not many people next door.  I had one friend who lived in the next farm.  He was [Joe Mamo] from Malta and actually he went to the same school.  He went to St. Andrew’s [with me] for a while as well.  I knew a few people on the other farm, on the opposite side, and would occasionally see them.  I bonded with people on the farm.  One of the farm hands’ sons, Leroy, I was kind of really good pals with.  He was younger than me.  I did a portrait of him in oil, one of my first oil portraits, and I won first prize in the student competition at Williams when I was there.\n\nQ:  Were you a fairly serious art student?\n\nBenepe:  I majored in it at Williams.  I switched from an economics major.  I had been majoring in economics at Williams, and that’s sort of jumping right ahead fast, but because I thought I was going to go into my dad’s [embroidered table linen] business like my brother [Bruce] did.  He studied aeronautical engineering…at M.I.T., and went into the Naval Air Corps and served out his service years in the Navy.  He was a pilot trainer.  He trained people to fly [bombers and fighters].  So when he came out [at the end of the war], he went to work at my dad’s office, and he felt my dad really needed him.  I guess my dad made him feel that way, because my dad said to me, he said, “Well, if I hadn’t hired him, I’m not sure what he would have done,” which is kind of a mean thing to say, but he said that only to me.  Bruce did very well in the firm for a long time.  He succumbed to prostate cancer, and he didn’t catch it early and they didn’t have ways of doing it then, and treatment wasn’t as good.  So he died at a fairly young age, in his sixties.\n\tSo the experience on the farm was very meaningful to me, and I became really attached to the soil in a basic way.  I used to spend days after a rain shower looking for arrowheads and found a lot, built up a good collection, and people would bring me things they found, like good-sized ax heads in the fields.  So I became really interested in the history of the land, the archeology, and I was a collector of things.  I had my own little room at the back of the house, and I’d collect roots and things that interested me.  I had a little geology collection.  So I moved with earth things.\nSo that when I majored in economics [and Spanish], I thought I was going to pursue my dad’s business, and I took Spanish because we had a lot of relationships—the war changed things for the company.  Submarine warfare and so forth meant they lost all their contact.  In a revolution in China they lost their supplies from China.  World War II cut off supplies from Belgium and France, and so that they moved toward the Caribbean to get things made of grass and cork, and he reached out to designers, Russell Wright to design pottery, which he sold and put on exhibit with the linens.  He had cork mats with imprinted paintings by Winslow Homer on it, the scenes he did in the Caribbean.\n\nQ:  So was your father in New York part of the time and at the farm part of the time?\n\nBenepe:  Yes, he was.  And he was an art collector.  He loved art himself, and both he being a lover of art and my mother being a [commercial illustrator]. I remember there was an apocryphal story which someone told me, I don’t know how true it was, but that during a cocktail party they were having after they were first married and living on Ninth Street, that if they were living there then that would have been eight years before I was born, but that my dad overheard someone saying, “How can they afford an apartment like this?”  Because it was a two-floor studio apartment in a new building.  He heard the response, “Don’t you know Marge has this great job designing for Lord & Taylor?”  Not designing, but doing illustrations.  And so he was upset about his manliness, I guess, his ability to support the family, and he persuaded her to quit her job.  I don’t know how true that is.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nBenepe:  Because obviously when I was born and a child, and this was almost twenty years or fifteen years after they were married, so I don’t know how these stories mesh, but she drew a portrait of me using a photograph and having me pose live, in charcoal and pencil, I think both, and she gave me her set of drawing pencils, sort of like passing them along to me.\n\nQ:  What were your parents’ names?\n\nBenepe:  He was Robert, and my mother was Marjorie.  Her maiden name was Tyler.  Her father was a doctor as well.  So she had lots of things mixing together.\n\tSo their backgrounds, I think, influenced me, their interests.  My dad was always supportive of my choices because I made this shift at Williams to go into an art major, and it happened because I took a trip to Europe in ’49, after my junior year, and it exposed me to the roots of our own western culture in a way that I never could here.  One of the things that stood out in my experience was going up into the Laon Cathedral Tower and seeing graffiti carved on the walls of the stairs, with the date 1597 on the walls, and I said, “Oh, somebody has been around here.”  [laughs]  So just the whole exposure to art history and Europe was amazing.\n\tSo I had taken the Art I, II course under Lane Faison at Williams, and fortunately we traveled by ship then, not by air, so I had five days to reflect on my experience, and it was a little bit like Saint Paul in Damascus; I got the message.  I had time to meditate on what I’d been doing, and thought I should shift my major to art.  I went to see Lane Faison, the head of the department, and said, “Would you accept me as a major?”  And he did, and it was pure bliss because I concentrated on nothing but art courses.\n\nQ:  This was art history and studio, or just plain art history? \n\nBenepe:  No, studio too.  I worked on engraving, lithograph, other media, and it was in that year that I entered two pieces into the student art show, mixed media, where I mixed some charcoal, watercolor, and a little ink.  I usually [relied on external reality to] paint, like the portrait of Leroy; and I did a painting of a swimming pool.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  That’s great.\n\nBenepe:  Because I liked all the blues in the pools, painted a pool.  And then actually when I painted Leroy, his brown skin and I painted him against a blue background, which was sort of invented.  I had him sit in the pump house because the light there was a cool light, and so his brown skin had a blue highlights on it too.  I liked that combination of the dark brown and that blue.\n\nQ:  And how old were you then?\n\nBenepe:  I was probably—well, let’s see.  If I was in Williams already, then I was nineteen.  The painting had been earlier than the art show.  I brought it to the art show, so I could have been eighteen or nineteen when I did it.  The art show was [in 1949] when I was—let me get my dates straight.  Yes, when I would have been twenty-one.\nThere was a painter there.  I loved his work, a guy named John Goodrich. I thought he was top rate, and I thought he would get the first prizes.  Well, he got two second prizes and I got the two firsts, and I didn’t expect to get any, wasn’t looking for prizes.  The mixed media piece was the first I did without having a subject in front me, and I had the subject in my mind, which was stimulated by an experience in the library where I saw students listening to music over on earphones, and they were so concentrating.  I don’t know how many were there, but I put three in the picture because I wanted this triangle, and the base of the triangle was some man leaning on his elbows, this formed the base, and the other triangle was a superimposed figure standing above him, and the third triangle was a light coming from a window which I invented, although there were high windows in the library.  So I entitled the piece Silent Music.\nOne of the judges was James Thrall Soby from the Museum of Modern Art, and I got this story from Lane.  He called me up and invited me to come to this party to announce the winners, which I just ignored, didn’t know anything about it.  So I came over and he told me that I had won first prize, and then he said when Soby came to my painting he said, “I don’t have to go any further.”  Like, “This is it.”  I was really pleased.  I didn’t think that much of myself.\n\tSo at that point, taking the art major was great.  They have a comprehensive exam where you’re exposed for a day to various works which you’ve never seen before and asked to write about them.  The professors, they had Faison, Pierson, Bill Pierson, who taught American art, and the third teacher was Whitney Stoppard who mainly concentrated in medieval art. He and I didn’t get along so well.  I thought there was something a little phony about him, and he didn’t think much of me, I don’t think, either, and they read the exams without knowing who wrote them. [Lane told me that] when they read some of what I had written about some of the paintings there, Faison said, “I think it’s Benepe,” and [Stoddard] said, “No, he could never write anything like that.”  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Had you known that Williams was known to be such a fine place for the study of art and artists?\n\nBenepe:  No.  No, I didn’t know that at all.  My dad picked it because his best friend, Col Brewer, who lived on Gramercy Park, had gone there and recommended it.  I thought I wanted to go to William & Mary.  [laughs]  It had a nicer sound.  I thought Virginia would be a nice place to be.  So I had no idea when I went there what I was going there for, and, in fact, I was really a terrible student the first year.  I was lazy.  I would cook hamburgers in my room and pass them out the window to other students.  When I would study, I’d put a blanket on the lawn, you know.  I was really badly disciplined and I’m wondering how I got through at all.  So it was really a struggle the first three years.  I took courses which were too advanced for me, in physics and chemistry.  They were like 1A course instead of 1, not true beginning courses.\nSo I was struggling to find myself in college, and I found myself best in things which were extracurricular.  I did advertising for the newspaper because I liked to illustrate, prepare the ad copy.  I organized events.  When we had a party weekend in the house, I would do the decorating and make a big Calder-type mobile of a skier coming down the stairs.  For one of the big spring weekends I planned the Field Day events.  I’d go out to Troy and interview bands, and I would hire an airplane to drop leaflets from the sky.  I was an events person.  [laughs]  I was wasting my tuition at college.\n\tSo in a way, that segues into Greenmarket, because Greenmarket is an event.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBenepe:  I would say for those four years in college, food was not very germane to my existence.  One interesting food story was that I was trying to sell tickets to a concert, and sitting around with some fellow students in the drugstore, and I couldn’t persuade them to buy tickets and I said, “Well, listen.  If you’ll buy these four tickets, I’ll make you a bet that I can eat ten strawberry sundaes in five minutes.”\nSo they said, “You’re on.”  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Oh, my lord.\n\nBenepe:  I sucked these strawberries, and my mouth and throat were totally numb with cold, frozen, but I did sell the tickets.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  That’s a great story.\n\nBenepe:  So that’s my experience with food, I don’t know how wholesome that is.  So then after I knew I was going to be moving to the art field, but not sure where I wanted to be, one of my teachers recommended Cooper Union, which was in a way stepping backwards because my fellow students at Cooper were coming out of high school and I was coming out of college, and Cooper didn’t give a degree then.  But the great thing about Cooper is it gave you a basic feel for art fields.  One was called fine arts, another was called three-dimensional arts, and the third was architecture and design.\n\nQ:  And it was free, yes?\n\nBenepe:  Exactly.  You took an exam to get in, and that was appealing.  So each time I’d consult my father, and he was supporting my living, my living style all this time.  I didn’t have any way of earning money.  I never really thanked him for what he did.  He was just very supportive, and I think he was supportive because of his interest in the arts.  He had a lot of really good paintings.  In fact, I’m told—he never told me this himself—but he once had a Blue Period Picasso, and he sold it.\n\nQ:  It’s too horrible to think about.  [laughs]\n\nBenepe:  I know it.  But I used to have a De Kooning, which I purchased for $200, and the last time it was sold, it was like 2.4 million.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  It was a full painting?\n\nBenepe:  Yes, it was a pastel.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nBenepe:  At that time, I’m sure it’s called Woman III, but when it was auctioned at the auction house a few years ago, it was called just Woman, but it was on the face of the catalog.  It was that important.\n\nQ:  How did you buy it?  How did you happen to—\n\nBenepe:  Well, one my teachers, a guy named Delavante at Cooper Union, he said, “You really should go see this painter.” \n\tAnd I said, “Good.  I think I will.”  So I did, and I was really enthralled with the work, and not only that, but he was like a near neighbor of mine.  I had a studio on Fourth Avenue and Tenth Street, and I could look out my window and see him painting in his studio.\n\nQ:  Oh, how extraordinary.\n\nBenepe:  But he was on Third Avenue, I was on Fourth, out the back window, but I didn’t know that, didn’t know much about him.\nThe other connection I made then was another artist Delavante referred me to was Seymour Lipton.  Lipton was a dentist then.  So I went to see Lipton to be my dentist so I could get to know him as a sculptor, and so we spent a lot of time, and he would show me his maquettes, and he would turn it upside down.  He said, “What do you think of it this way and this way?”  He loved to talk about his work while he was working.  I’m still in touch with his son [Michael] now, who has a lot of his collection in the basement up on 98th St.  [I had done some interior design in that house for Sy in exchange for dentistry. Michael wanted to place Lipton’s work in Central or Riverside Parks]. \n\nQ:  Get the individual pieces into the park system?\n\nBenepe:  It hasn’t worked so far.  I’ll keep trying.  So you can see I’m moving across history here a lot and not sticking much with Greenmarket yet.\n\nQ: That’s fine.\n\nBenepe:  So that Cooper then gave me the ability to find my way in the arts, and I didn’t feel I had a message to do through painting, for some reason.  I wanted to move more into useful three-dimensional arts that involve people and my surroundings.  In fact, I thought of the idea of store window design.  I want to Lord & Taylor’s to find who their designers were and how they worked, because they did nice work there.  The person I talked to, I think the designer, said, “It’s really not so much design as marketing.  You have to know marketing,” and that didn’t interest me too much.  But it’s interesting how it sort of relates to my mother’s activity, which was to push clothing in a different direction, also at Lord & Taylor’s.\nThen I thought of theater design, and, in fact, while I was at Williams I did the sets for a musical written by a classmate [Stephen Sondheim].\n\nQ:  This was a musical at Williams?\n\nBenepe:  Yes.  It was a class musical. It was really wonderful.  I didn’t build any sets.  What we did was I put them on glass plates and we projected them, because we had to move from scene to scene quickly.  So I’d work late at night in the back, painting on glass plates.\n\tSo at Cooper then I was moving to different fields, and I liked three-dimensional design the best of all.  My teacher there was George Kratina, and he said, “Well, you know, you should go on to M.I.T. because you really want to move into architecture.  I can see that.”  Then at M.I.T. my strongest influence was Kevin Lynch, who talked about urban form and wrote some excellent books, and another lecturer there came from Denmark, named Steen Eiler Rasmussen.  Lynch wrote [The Image of the City].  Rasmussen wrote [Towns and buildings].  \n\nQ:  How did you go to M.I.T.?  How did that happen?\n\nBenepe:  Well, George Kratina recommended it to me, and I applied and was accepted, and then told my father, the poor guy.  [laughs]  He said, “How could you do this to me? I’ll be paying tuition forever.”  [laughs]  He was very angry, really, and I didn’t understand why he was angry, but he didn’t pull out the rug from under me.  Then to make matters worse, I met a woman I was in love with, and I wanted to marry her and take her with me to M.I.T., and he said, “Over my dead body.  I’m not supporting her too.”  [laughter]\n\tSo those were good years.  They were difficult years, because I had to take a lot of scientific courses over again, strength and materials, acoustics, things not too interesting.  In fact, I got an F in one of the courses, which meant I had to take it over, and an E in math so I took the make-up exam.  But I lived in a co-op house, and one of my fellow residents was a math teacher, so he drilled me on how to pass the make-up exam.  The other lesson I learned about the strength and materials course—no, it was not that one, it was a different one—Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nBenepe:  Right.  And I realized when my professor asked me four reasons why radiant heating was an improved method of heating a building, I would just develop my own reasons rather than looking at my notes from his lectures.  So I realized the second year is to make sure to do two things.  One is make sure the answers on assignments are all correct.  The students always worked with each other.  Two, on exams to provide the answers you know he is looking for.\n\nQ:  A very important lesson.\n\nBenepe:  And a third [failure] was something I always failed to do in my subjects, to  keep up with the work.  I took math at M.I.T. from the guy who wrote the book, and I just couldn’t keep up with the course, and so I’d be a third of the way through the book when we were all the way through the course.  [laughs]  He was a wonderful teacher.\n\nQ:  But he really knew the material.  [laughs]\n\nBenepe:  Oh, I took a course in illumination with a wonderful teacher named—imagine this course in illumination, right?  It’s a course in architecture.  It was taught by a man named [Parry] Moon.\n\nQ:  Perfect.\n\nBenepe:  But I did okay, and I moved from almost failing out the first year, getting my methodology correct in the second year, and ended up on the Dean’s List.  I moved from architecture into city planning as my major sort of course, and that’s when Kevin Lynch was big.  The other person who was an artist there—trying to remember who it was—[Gyorgy  Kepes].  I worked in his house helping him paint his ceiling because I wanted to know him better as an artist, and he did work on enamels.  He did the work for the Pittsburgh Library…. \n\tSo I kept myself really engrained in the arts while I was there, and my major—well, I was moving into city planning, but I graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture.  The other people who were a big influence on me was—geodesic dome, Fuller.  Buckminster Fuller came to lecture and he was a marvelous person.  He would start a lecture at eight and still going strong at midnight.  [laughs] [I worked with him and fellow students building a geodesic dome in Woods Hole]….\n           I graduated from MIT in March, in the middle of the year [1955].  Again, with my dad’s help, I got a job in a large architect’s office.\n\nQ:  What year would that have been?\n\nBenepe:  That would have been ’55.\n\nQ:  An architect’s office in New York?\n\nBenepe:  In Manhattan, yes. Eggers & Higgins. It was kind of a run-of-the-mill office.  It did pretty standard buildings.  But there was one man there, an Israeli man who I really liked his work, and I tried to move under him, but I was hardly qualified to work in the firm, even though I’d had a degree from M.I.T.  They really stressed design and engineering, but I couldn’t do drafting.  I didn’t know how to letter.  We never were taught basics of drafting at M.I.T.  So that the head draftsman looked at my lettering and said, “You’ve got to go home and work on this,” and he’d give me letters to copy, and I worked on it and became proficient in drafting.\n\tThen I was asked to do some design work for the Syosset High Schools, working on some of the interiors.  I went out to see the school, and I was amazed that they actually built what I designed.  I thought they were just giving me work to do. But then I met [Wynaut Van Der Pool], an architect who had a one-man office, and he asked if I would work with him because he had more work than he could handle alone.  So I left Eggers & Higgins, this first firm was called.  [The Israeli architect] there I wanted to work with because he was doing really advanced work, they wouldn’t assign me to him.  Instead I worked on Georgian re-productions for the University of Virginia and things like that, and they would badly site the buildings.  They would take this formal Georgian building and stick it on the slope of one corner, exposed way at the bottom, you know, because there wasn’t room on the site to fit it properly. \n[However, I did admire a silver haired draftsman there who used a very soft but very sharp drafting pencil with such skill and elegance. He would create shadow lines when drawing the multi-paned Georgian windows, simply varying the pressure on his pencil.] \n\nQ:  But you recognized that it was sited badly?\n\nBenepe:  Well, I didn’t intellectually, but I felt it in my soul, yes, that it was just not good design, and they were trying too hard and they were doing the wrong kind of things for the wrong reason, but I didn’t rationalize this.  Of course, I was exposed to new work that was going on such as Lever House, and also the biggest things once, I think, was Corbusier’s Ronchamps chapel.\n\nQ:  Had you seen it?\n\nBenepe:  No, I hadn’t, but I did see it in ’59 [during a trip to Europe].\nWhen I was at M.I.T. [in 1954], I had designed a housing project.  It was on a hill.  And I thought to myself, “How do I want this project to look?”  And I said, “Well, I want to frame the views.”  It was on the side of the hill.  So I began sculpting the houses in curved forms so that they would be like trumpets facing the view, and then I would have [entered them through] the back.  So they became items of sculpture on the hill rather than houses.\nI married in ’55, the year I graduated from M.I.T.  My wife, [Jagna], was the daughter of a Polish U.N. official named Antoni Wojicki, who had worked for the Polish government in exile in London during the war.  But she, my wife, and her brother and mother were left in Warsaw.  They hadn’t left with him to England when the Germans attacked and leveled the city, and their apartment building was one of the few left intact.\n\nQ:  A miracle.\n\nBenepe:  They tried to escape the city, but they were taken prisoner and put on [an open freight] train, and they thought they were maybe on the train leaving for concentration camps in the east.  They weren’t Jewish, but that didn’t probably matter so much if you were Polish.  Her mother bribed a guard to turn his back by giving him a gold wedding ring she had, and they got off the train at night and lay down on the tracks while the train passed overhead.  Then they went across fields, and they were very hungry, of course, but it was summertime, so they found tomatoes and onions. [Jagna] said they’d never enjoyed vegetables so much in their life.  But they were soon captured again, and then they were taken to another prison camp, they called them, not prisons, I think, farther from the border so it would be harder to escape, I guess.  They finally were rescued at the end of the war, reunited with their father and then they came [to the U.S. where Antek worked with the U.N. secretariat in housing], and that’s when they came to this country.\nThey got Jagna involved with the American Friends Service Committee, and I was [ involved] as well when I was in [Cambridge at MIT].  So we met on a Friends retreat, Jagna and I did.  We married not long after.  This would, again, have been 1955.  Then, after graduation, I worked as an architect in New Rochelle.  It seems like I always lived in places with the word “New” in front of them, [but they were actually] old places.  New York, New Rochelle, Newburgh, and Newcastle on Tyne in England.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Funny.\n\nBenepe:  And they were all these old historic cities.\nSo here I am in New Rochelle and we were mainly involved in political things, Jagna and I.  We were very involved in the Peace Movement…[with] the American Friends Service Committee.  We went on retreats.  Bayard Rustin was a big influence.  Have you ever heard of him?\n\nQ:  Yes.  But you were working as?\n\nBenepe:  I was working as an architect, draftsman.  [After Eggers & Higgins] I went to work for [Wynant Vanderpool], and I loved working for him, and he would give me a house to work on and I would just capture that house.  It would be in my head.  I said, “You know, you need a model of this house,” and made a model of it.  At first he would present to me, he said, “My client has a budget,” and he had two designs.  One was obviously beyond the budget, and one was in it.\n\tAnd I said, “We’ve got to do the one within the budget.”  He already had his floor plan.  I said, “Let me draw it up and make a model.”  It was a lovely little house I made for him.\nThere were some other things I worked on with him, and in the meantime, he went to the Caribbean to meet with potential clients [from whom] he was hoping to get more work.  He came back from the Caribbean and he’d gotten no new work.  He said, “Listen.  I have really no work now in the office.  I have to let you go.”  And so for the next few days, I’d be riding in a bus and still designing this house in my head.  It hadn’t left me yet.  It was like an aborted child.  So I never knew if the house was ever built or not.  There was another house he designed.  He was influenced a little bit by Frank Lloyd Wright.  The house was in Morristown, New Jersey, and it was too long and angular and out of kilter, and it wasn’t well organized, whereas the house I designed for him was really simple and basic.\n\tThere was another guy [Jagna and I] was very much involved with [on the American] Friends Service Committee. It was a man named Sheldon Weeks, and Sheldon had a friend at Sands Point named Dana Backus…. He was a fairly wealthy guy, like an attorney, and Sheldon was living in his gardener’s cottage and he wanted to build an addition on the cottage.  So I designed [and helped build] the addition, and what I did was really kind of daring.  I made a bridge out to the room and it was on a slope, so it suspended over the ground.  And I built up these columns of solid concrete blocks, sort of laid vertically, not horizontally.  Then to make it really mannered, the two posts supported on those two block piers ended on finials of brass so there’d be a concentrated weight on the blocks.  A crazy thing to do, but I sort of liked that expression.  It came out of those [Dadaist traditions of the 20’s].  What did those artists do?  They hung [a big rock] on piano wires to show the strength of the piano wire--a big rock on a piano wire, that sort of statement.  This was a building for someone to live in and I hoped it held up okay.  I developed the structural system which I used later in another house. I’m not talking much about food or farming yet, of course, [but I will].\n\tWhat was interesting about the house, and maybe unique is it wasn’t supported on the outside, but more toward the center so that it would be basically four [internal] points of support.  These would go up to the mid points to the sides of the roof, and then they’d form [a cantilevered] A-structure to brace it, so that it left the corners free of supporting the roof.  As a consequence, I could take the windows at the corners and treat them like store windows and bevel the glass to meet glass, so there was no [visible] corner support.  Underneath this I used cement stucco, and because this was near the beach in [Sands Point], across Long Island Sound.  This, again, was in the early fifties.  While I was working jobs, I did my own work freelance and that was this was.  I would go to the beach and pick up sea-washed glass, the kind you find on the beach, and I’d embed these into the corners [so the light would pass through, both day and night].\n\nQ:  Oh, it sounds beautiful.\n\nBenepe:  So the light would come through from the inside, and then I would also embed other things like shells and so forth, to express the fact that it was near the shore.  And then also to relate to sailing, the bridge that led out to this building, the two walls were laid, as I recall, I did it in dark vertical beveled wood, tongue and groove planks behind which were closets, both sides.  They needed storage.  So you’d walk through the hallway and closets on both sides, and for the roof over this, I took thin slats and bent them in curves [squeezed] by these walls, so they were in compression rather than the weight of anything on them, and across them I across white nylon canvas, which I laced up and down the sides of the cedar boards so it had a ship feeling in the lacing.  So the house had a lot of interesting things like that, and I’ve always wanted to go back and see how it’s held up.\n\tThen I did a second house when I divorced my wife Jagna.  She moved with a guy up to New Hampshire and he asked me to design their house, which I did.  [laughter]  This second house embodied both the buildings [I’d designed with sculptured walls] at M.I.T. that were curved and also the structural concept of the house in Sands Point….  In other words, the house itself had the curved walls which faced the view; that was the living area.  It was two levels.  And then there was the wood sheathed service area, which was more boxlike, which contained the utilities, the heating, the kitchen and everything that was mechanical and electrical.  So one was sort of living and yet it was mechanical.  And then the roof was supported like the house in Sands Point.  It went across [internal] third points with [two] long [trussed] beams, and so they were supported independently at three points on this curved wall and the end wall, and so the space between the top of the wall and the underside of the roof was [enclosed by a thin curving] sheet of plastic, [to emphasize the roof floating over, not resting, on the curved masonry wall].\n\nQ:  It’s very daring, these things.  What gave you the sense of freedom to do that?\n\nBenepe:  I don’t know.  [laughs]  It was my right.  I mean, if I don’t, who does, you know.  It just seemed like the right thing to do.  I mean, I always appreciated Frank Lloyd Wright talking about organic, because it was a meaningful word to me, that it grows out of the sense of form and function, really.  The interesting thing about going to Ronchamps is I saw Ronchamps after I had designed the project at M.I.T., and it was the same forms, because Ronchamps had these curved forms.  I did the house up in New Hampshire far after I’d seen Ronchamps.  But I think Corbusier was important to me [as a sculptor]. I liked the Habitation in Marseille quite a bit.  I sort of agree with Jane Jacobs about his planning, that it was not [at] human scale, but then, fortunately, he didn’t build those.  I think the work that Corbusier did in India, in Chandigarh, was interesting, the planning, the roads curving.  He did better work than [Albert] Mayor did there, and I think Mayor took over and straightened the streets out.  I worked for Mayor’s office for a while, when it was Mayor, Whittlesey and Glass.  So, I mean, all of these people were influences.  Julian Whittlesey was a big influence. \nOne of the people there became—well, there were two guys who worked there later on, Jim Rossant and Bill Conklin, and they became partners.  In a way, Jim Rossant and I bonded, even after I left there in ’58.  We always kept in touch and I’m still in touch with him today. [Rossant died in Dec. 2009, after this interview was conducted].  He’s in France now, and he’s done a lot of good design work and he’s exhibited as an artist and he sold three pieces in his last show in France.  His wife was Colette Rossant.  You know her?\n\nQ:  Yes, I do.\n\nBenepe:  Of course.  So [we’ve] been close friends.\n\nQ:  They ate well.  [laughter]\n\nBenepe:  Yes.  She ate a little bit too well, I think.  They have wonderful children, and his son Tomas I brought on the board of the Fine Arts Federation, of which I’ve been a member of for over thirty years, [of New York], and he’s been chair of the organization for the last two to three years, and he will be resigning as chair this summer.  So it’s nice to keep the family together that way.  He works with Polshek.  He’s a partner of Polshek’s office just two blocks from here.  So it’s a small world.\n\tSo advancing through my architectural work, I’ve kept things pretty much in chronological context.  I worked in various architectural offices, some which were really not good placements, and I did work for a small firm I’d read about and liked [Perkins & Will].  It did good schoolwork, but I found myself going there as a draftsman.  This was in White Plains. I’m not sure.  You know, this again would have been the late fifties, and I would be doing ridiculous [but fun] things like picking out tile colors for the floors and stuff like that.  Somewhere I began to think I wasn’t made out to be an architect, at least not in that context.\nI worked for an architect in New Rochelle named Lee Perry, and he was a nice guy and I got some run-of-the-mill schoolwork to do, and I could walk to work through a park and that was wonderful, I didn’t have to commute anywhere, and that’s why I wanted to work there, so I could walk.\nThen when I found my New York planning job, when I first went back to New York, was to work in planning.  It was firm called Candeab and Fleissig, and their main office was in Newark.  I worked in their Newark office for a while, but then they opened up an office in New York City doing urban renewal work here, and that exposed me to urban renewal as a concept, but it was planning and it was working with communities, and at that time the City Planning Department had first prepared (under James Felt) [had initiated] their first comprehensive way of doing urban renewal.  They did what they call conservation, rehabilitation, and rebuilding.  So there are three phases or three ways of approaching one community.  We did the West Side urban renewal area, and I devoted myself to that and I did drawings of how to treat open spaces.  I did a lot of planning.  I planned the Morningside Urban Renewal area, in which I would close streets [to motor vehicles].  I would really develop the form of the city around different concepts to try to shape how things would happen.  In fact, what I was doing then really led to some of the things today’s transportation commissioner is doing today.  What’s her name?  I just met with her a few weeks ago.  Her name will come to me. [Janette Sadik-Kalin]  But she is beginning to reshape streets in that way.  I don’t know if you’ve seen Broadway below Times Square.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBenepe:  This was what I’d been trying to do back then in 1950s and sixties in work here.  One of the things I contributed to the city as more as a volunteer than anything else, because I worked for a group called Metropolitan Committee on Planning as a volunteer, and there was a proposal then to redesign the Civic Center down around City Hall, a proposal that would have eliminated the meeting of the archway through the municipal building, where there are two streets in the back which crossed, and they were going to use these two cross streets as their main access [thereby blocking the pedestrian passage], and I said, “No.  We should be crossing that x with the pedestrian [passage] through the archway, reaching beyond.”  And there actually is a citizen pressure group.  We got them to change that.  We worked with their planners, and that’s when they build their new Police Center and the mall that led to it, and all that design was done by a pretty well established firm uptown.  I think it was Gruzen Associates.\n\nQ:  I don’t know.\n\nBenepe:  Anyway, they adopted it and carried it through.  The only thing I had wanted to carry it further, to make sure the Al Smith housing all the way to the East River, and make the Al Smith housing an attractive place for people to go to do things rather than segregate the housing from the community.  There is an example where that was done successfully in London [near Russell Square].  You may be familiar with it.  I don’t remember the name of it, but it’s a U-shaped court feeling.  It’s not far from Russell Square, and the inside of the U tapers down with all the apartments stepping down to a simple courtyard, and then all the apartments have glazed porches. Then on the ground floor where the shops are, and then the inside of this—so it’s like this, the back being straight up and the front going on the courtyard, there’s this big A-frame.  So you’d have this enormous tall corridor, A-frame corridor, [through which] you can walk and look up.  It’s quite a brilliant design.  There’s a movie theater tucked into it on one side, and they always had the best movies were shown there.  It’s a very successful design.  Designs like this influenced my thinking about architecture and what could be done with streets, and, of course, London had a lot of closed streets.  So I wanted to bring that to New York.\n\tI got involved with another private client and got in a battle with Jane Jacobs in a way.  The client was—I worked with a guy named Roger Schaefer, who were developers to put in what he called housing for the poor.  He searched out federal programs which would subsidize housing for really low-income people, not middle-income.\n\nQ:  Where?\n\nBenepe:  Anywhere he could get sites, and that’s where I came in.  He said, “Can you find me a site in the West Village?”\n\tI said, “Well, I don’t work that way, but I will develop a plan which I think might work for the West Village,” because I worked as a planner, “in which housing might work.”  Then I would go around and talk to people.  What my planning approach was, I went in to businesses to see what was going on, how many people they employed, what the condition of the buildings were, and then I went to see Jane Jacobs, but I couldn’t tell her who my client was because I didn’t have permission to do this, but I said, “I’d like your thinking about approaching this.”\nAt the time I went in there, she was having a meeting with Stanley Isaacs, who was then a member of the City Council, and she was fighting urban renewal.  Stanley said, “Why don’t you come up with your own plan.”\n\tAnd she said, “No, because if I come up with my own plan, then they’ll shoot me down.”  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Right.\n\nBenepe:  So when I talked with Jane, I said I’d like her to participate in my planning, but I couldn’t tell her my client.  I said I was just doing this in my own project.  And then Jim Rossant later was talking to her and told her who my client was, and she asked me to come to a meeting at her house where all these people sitting around to attack me.  I came out literally in tears, you know.  They kind of escorted me out of the neighborhood, and one of the guys was walking with me and he said, “Why don’t you cross the street.”  A kid walked out, ran out to catch a ball and was almost hit by a car.\n\tAnd I said, “This is the kind of problem I want to deal with, to create streets which are safe for people to be on.”\nSo Jane and I never hardly talked to each other after that, and I found it very interesting that I should receive the Jane Jacobs Award this year.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Yes.  I was thinking that, yes.\n\nBenepe:  But the first time I got to know her was when I was working downtown in Lower Manhattan, and they were having these ridiculous exercises to prevent [death] from atomic bomb attacks.  We’d all get under the tables and desks when the sirens went off.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Right.\n\nBenepe:  And so I met her during one of the demonstrations against this sort of fake protection.  Before that, I wrote to her when she was writing for the Architectural Forum and she had done an analysis of, of all things, a shopping center in Texas, I think, and she praised it, this shopping center, because it reminded her of St. Mark’s [in Venice] and the piazza.\n\nQ:  That’s amazing.\n\nBenepe:  And I said, “I think you’re looking at it too much as a floor plan and not the scale of the thing.”\n\tAnd she replied, she said I was looking at it too much from the bird’s-eye point of view, and I don’t think I was looking at it from the ground’s-eye point of view, but at least we got a chance to meet over this, and she responded, and responded to other things.  So I liked the fact her interests were there, and I loved her book.  I mean, I thought her way of approaching Death and Life of American Cities, but on the other hand, I found her conclusions [flawed].  Her analysis was great, but she didn’t draw the right conclusions from the analysis.  She said public housing is bad per se, whereas I revert back to the public housing in Britain I was describing to you.\nAnd it was a very unusual—I mean, it was part of the best design [unclear], whereas that was designed to bring people into it.  I wanted to bring people over into Al Smith houses and make that a place to be.  I maintained that public housing, if you integrated with the community, the community will come into it and vice versa.  The design of the buildings was terrible.  The ground floors were half off the ground and half below, so you couldn’t walk into a house at all.  None of the ground floor apartments had outdoor spaces that were private, or gardens.  So there was no use of open space in a human way, and so everything about the design was purely mechanical.\n\tJim Rossant and Bill Conklin worked on a project in Brooklyn which [unclear] she dislikes a lot, I think.  We made an attempt to create a townhouse at the ground level.  I.M.Pei was trying to create something decent in Philadelphia [with Rittenhouse Square].  There was a movement in that direction of [human] scale.\nSo we’ve gone a long way and haven’t even gotten close to Greenmarket.\n\nQ:  Were you working on your own at that point?\n\nBenepe:  I didn’t become independent until about the time I hired Bob [Lewis in 1979]. We were a two-man office.  At that point I was moving through planning echelons, moving upward, and the last firm I worked for [Hancock Little Calvert, whose NYC office was run by] Robert C. Weinberg [during the early 70’s].  Bob Weinberg—do you know who he is?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nBenepe:  He was my mentor, really, in a very true way, in a way many other people were.  He and I met at the AIA [American Institute of Architects].  I was working on one of the committees, I think it was a committee on urban design, and at that time there was a split within the AIA over the West Side Highway, I think it was about, and I was opposed with the way it was being designed, the whole project, and there were people in AIA who were supportive of it….  I think that was a major project, and I remember the chair at the time was split down the middle himself, and he didn’t know who to support, and we really split down the middle.  We had an executive director then [George Lewis] who was more on the side of what I call the conservatives, who believed in big development.\nSo Bob got personally interested in me and asked if I’d work in his office and reach out to the smaller communities upstate in Sullivan County to [help prepare land use and zoning plans].\n\nQ:  What was Bob doing then?\n\nBenepe:  Bob Weinberg, he was [working] as a planning consultant, but he also had a radio program, WNYC.  He was an architectural and planning critic.  In fact, one day he gave me the opportunity to participate on one of his [radio talks]—he wrote.  He kind of read an editorial on the air, a commentary.  He reviewed one project for Bryant Park, which was involved in putting a show on in the park, [an enormous spectacle called Orlando Furioso, the predecessor of fashion shows to come] in Bryant Park under a tent, for the entire summer, sponsored, I think, by the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, and I had my office in Bryant Park then.  When I was working for Bob Weinberg, he had his office there, and then I took it over later after he died.  That’s [where] I became independent [consultant working under my own name].\n\nQ:  Where did you say in the park?\n\nBenepe:  On the south side on Fortieth Street, overlooking the park.  So I was very familiar with what was happening.  The show was going on at that point, and I wrote a critique on it for Bob, which he did on the air.  What happened is this show was supposed to happen on one of the piers [in the Hudson River] under a tent, I think, or in the pier building, and a woman named Stephanie Sills was involved in organizing for mayor—I think then it was Mayor Lindsay.  I guess Stephanie Sills might have been a daughter of Beverly Sills.  I’m not sure.  I don’t know; I’m just assuming that.\nAt any rate, the longshoremen gave her a hard time in terms of what they would demand to help on the pier.  So she at wit’s end.  “Where am I going to hold this show?  I made a commitment.”  Oh, I know what she was putting on.  \n\nQ:  Oh yes.\n\nBenepe:  It was a big Italian musical-type thing, with charging horses.  You know, I believe in shows too, but in the park on the grass?  So she put up this big tent to do it, and I was very critical of it.  Not only did it take over the lawn for the whole summer and destroy the lawn, but it also put up these massive generators to keep the tent full of air, which was going noisily booming away every day.\nSo Bob prepared this speech for WNYC.  It was broadcast on the air, his commentary, not mine.  And Segal I can’t remember Segal’s first name, was George or Alan, one of the Siegels who was president of WNYC, took his program off the air under pressure from the mayor, because he was so embarrassed by this, and said from that point on he’d have to vet all his programs before he’d broadcast them.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nBenepe:  Which he agreed to.  I don’t know if he ever told him I did it.\nSo there I was then in his office and doing this planning work for the town of Rockland  in Sullivan County.  The planning chair I worked under in the town of Rockland was a great guy named Alan Fried, who was very supportive of the planning work I was doing, and I was doing things no planners had ever done.  I worked with contours, slopes, natural resources, farmlands, and tried to develop really meaningful planning.  He was very supportive of everything I did, and I wrote their zoning laws and downtown detailed zoning and development forms.  And gradually at that point I was reaching out for other clients.  Then he died fairly soon after my joining the firm.\n\nQ:  Who he?\n\nBenepe:  Bob Weinberg.\n\nQ:  This was in the late sixties?\n\nBenepe:  It would have to be the early seventies.\n\nQ:  Early seventies?\n\nBenepe:  Yes, probably ’71 or so.  So I’d work on these projects under Bob’s name, and he paid me a salary.  As a senior planner for Hancock Little Calvert. I served as a consultant to Community Board Twelve in Washington Heights to evaluate the impact of the highway proposed along the Hudson River waterfront, and found a thoughtful informed ally in Marcy Benstock, [who fought the Westside Landfill proposals]. I was very much on her side of the issue.\nAlso I was really pushing for the idea of a surface road rather than the underground road, because the underground road didn’t result in eliminating traffic on the waterfront, because they put a road above the underground road for carrying local service traffic.  So it would have been pretty much as we have today, maybe not as many lanes, maybe four lanes instead of six, and then it would push the edge of the river much further out.  So I wanted to keep the river close to where it is now, and so that’s why we fought to accomplish this plan.  Marcy was a major player to make it work out because of her suit to protect the striped bass.  And other people were involved too.  Al Buteel was a big force, and he still is.  I worked with anybody we could, including the planning boards.  Planning Board 1 was very good on this issue.  Planning Board 2, pretty strong [as well]. … Planning Board 5 in midtown for a couple of years, and I worked on mainly zoning [and park and transportation] issues there for that board.\n\tSo when Bob died, I went out to reach out for clients, you know, to continue under my own name.  The other member of the firm was a guy named Jim Curle, who was a landscape architect, and Jim pulled in the Parks Department work. When Bob died, he left Hancock Little Calvert to work for ConEdison.  This was a [Toronto-based] firm.  They offered to take me up to Toronto with them, and I didn’t want to leave the city.  I wasn’t married then. I was involved with Mary [Frank] then, and didn’t want to leave the city and go to Toronto.\nSo I decided to just develop my own firm and reach out for work, and I was successful in reaching clients, chiefly in New York state in historic preservation [and landscape planning and zoning]….\n\nQ:  So the focus of your firm was what?\n\nBenepe:  Planning.  I was a planning firm.  So I became really concerned about the farmland loss then, working for the firm, especially in the Newburgh area where I had lived and worked in the late 60s. The County executive [Louis Heimbach] then was buying up farmland.  He wanted to see development and he only saw farmland as land banking issues for future development.  The irony is that he was renting land to one of the farmers in Greenmarket, Don Keller.  So as I saw farming as present and future use, he saw farming as a temporary use.  I sat down next to him at a county dinner of some kind and talked to him about this issue and didn’t get very far with him.\nSo I persisted in trying to raise the awareness of the importance of farming in the county, in Orange County, and I was talking with preservationists as well.  I mean, many of the best [historic] houses were on farms.\n\tSo Bob came to me then.  I wanted him because I wanted to get some work in Woodstock, New York, [where he had worked as part of a consultant planning team.]\n\nQ:  Bob Lewis?\n\nBenepe:  Bob Lewis.  He had done a program at the University of Pennsylvania and a grant from the…Audubon Foundation. He and a team went to Woodstock from the University of Pennsylvania to do kind of an environmental study of Woodstock, which led to changes in their zoning.  And because he had done such good basic work in Woodstock and I wanted to get work in Woodstock, I hired him, hoping he’d be a good connection, and I liked him.  I don’t know how I met him.  Somebody must have recommended him.\nSo we worked out of a two-man office, and we began kicking the idea around of a farmers’ market, because we had read the work of John Hess in the New York Times, and he was another mentor, basically.  John had written a glowing piece about the [Farmers] market in Syracuse.  Syracuse really had two markets.  It had the old historic market that went back a hundred years, which is still there, the big market.  It also had a downtown market, which was more of the model for Greenmarket, which was run by the Chamber of Commerce.  The woman running that program had done a study indicating that the market brought people downtown and that they continued to shop downtown.  Using this study, we wanted to advance this concept here [in New York City], so then we reached out for money and Bob went to [Richard Pough, president of the Natural Area Council] … Bob went to talk to him about our desire to raise money to look at Farmers Markets protect farmland.  He offered us a [start-up] grant from his foundation.\n\nQ:  Was that the Kaplan, J.M. Kaplan?\n\nBenepe:  No, before that. …\nBob introduced me to him, and so he gave us this small seed money grant of, I think, $800, which was meant to go out and raise serious money.  So our first thing was to do a feasibility study for the city to run farmers’ markets, and we asked for $7,000 to do this.  We talked to Suzanne Davis of the J.M. Kaplan fund, but more importantly, we talked to the fund for the City of New York.  It was Nancy Castleman who was representing then.  The Kaplan Fund was then directed by Suzanne Davis.  And both of them said, “You know, for what you want to do, you should have an independent group do it.”  The city had no money then in the seventies, and they said [the city] be unable to run a farmers’ market, “So you should find a nonprofit to do this.”\n\tSo then what did we do at that point?  Oh, then we looked for a nonprofit, and I wrote a letter to Margot Wellington, then the director of the Municipal Arts Society but I never heard back from her, and the reason was—I didn’t know it—she was ill in a hospital and not responding.\nAt the same time, I contacted the Council on the Environment [of New York City].  Barry Samuels was then the director, and so he was the first person I had a chance to speak to face-to-face, and they were really responsive to the idea of a farmers’ market.  We hadn’t developed Greenmarket yet.  So I wrote him a one-page contract where I would raise the money and they would let me direct the program.\n\nQ:  Direct the program once it got up and—\n\nBenepe:  The farmers’ market.  The council would run it [as a non-profit project] and I would direct it for them, and they would pay me a salary or consulting fee.  I forgot how I set it up.  Then I went out to raise money.  I raised our budget from $7,000 to $35,000 to really staff it and pay ourselves salaries to work on it.  The first year we were only able to raise $15,000, but that wasn’t bad.  And I had this other planning work I was doing, so it wasn’t that I needed that only for the money.\n\tWe then immersed ourselves into how do we run a farmers’ market.  [laughs]  I was familiar with some of the farms in Orange County.  We divided it by responsibility.  It was my job to look for sites [in NYC], and his [Bob’s] job to look for farmers, and he went to the nearby counties first in New Jersey and New York State.  He went to Ocean County, and I recall his saying that the Ocean County farmers felt that New York was too risky a place to sell in, that the mafia would rob them at the bridges and tunnels and demand payoffs.\n\nQ:  What appealed to you about the whole farmers’ market idea?\n\nBenepe:  Very good question.  The use of urban space for a more humane use than just parking cars and driving through it, and the recognition of the fact that city streets are virtually our only public spaces.  That’s how we experience the city and the country, for that matter.  Because I’m working, as you know, in Saugerties.  So, shaping and use of urban space is one.  The other was that losing the access to fresh food grown in our region and losing the farm land, that farmland was too essential.  I wanted to keep this symbiotic relationship that comes out of the medieval period of Europe, of village and rural community.  Part of the reason that the rural areas around Rome and London have remained rural is because they’re owned by rich people, or in the case of Rome, owned by the church, and so they didn’t permit developers to come in, they still don’t.  Now it’s become more vulnerable.  I didn’t know the history of that, but that’s why essentially it remained green.  And when you look at the pictures of [many European] cities and towns, they’re always surrounded by green and by farms.\n\tSo there’s a dedication without zoning, and it’s just tradition which kept it that way.  So I was trying to see how to we can keep the same thing here.  We don’t have that tradition of—we do have large estates owned by rich people, but they’re not farmers, largely.  And as the families age and their lands are inherited by multiple children, the tendency is to split the ownership and to seek out other means of sustaining their own personal economics.  So developers are hovering there in the trees, waiting to pounce when one is available.  So I was ready to pounce in [for] the benefit of farms.\nOf course, [there was] a third factor, which I had really forgotten, and my father was still living then when I formed Greenmarket, he reminded me of my growth on the farm.  I’d forgotten that and I’d forgotten the connection [I had forged with] the economic experiences of farming, that when somebody came in to pay my father for food they had purchased, one day at dinner he gave out a hundred one-dollar bills.  I said, “That’s a lot of money.”  [laughs]  And then another time he was paid a hundred dollars for something to do with food, and I saw the cash value of food raising, and I saw how the farmers were being basically cheated at the auction stand, and remembering that my brother would drive to Baltimore from the Eastern Shore, which is a long, long trip, three or four hours, to try to get a better price for beans, and once he drove to New York City.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nBenepe:  A seven-hour drive in order to get fifty cents more a bushel for beans, because the prices were so depressed.  Farmers then were shifting, like my dad did, to feed-stock [Black Angus cattle].  Soybeans were also a big crop then. And so he began raising black Hereford cattle, because truck farming was just not a way to make a living.\nSo this poor economic experience led to [a realization of] my experience to say, what do we do about repairing the match between city and country, and the economic viability of food from market or from farm to market?  So I was again reaching out to—there were examples out there, both historically and in fact, in Syracuse, NY. And [Marin County] in California, I think, was doing some good work in farmers’ markets about the same time.  We didn’t have much to go on as an example.\nSusan Snook was the name of the woman who was running the Syracuse downtown market, and great stories coming out of that, and again it was the writing in the papers by John Hess.  He wrote several articles, and John Hess also wrote pieces about the loss of the traditional Paris markets and other markets in France, and importances that had to do with the distribution of your food, and he wrote about the loss of beer making and cheese making in New York State, and individuality of beers and cheeses.  Of course, you didn’t have all these terrible draconian state laws which we’re dealing with even now, in terms of getting access to good food.\n\nQ:  What kind of laws were there?\n\nBenepe:  Well, [now, in our local Saugerties Farmers Market, which we started in 2002], we can’t, for example, have people come in and cook and sell in the market.  You have to have a kitchen which is approved.  You have to take these exams.  So it discourages people bringing food to the market, homemade foods, and even to make jams and jellies and special things.  For pickles, you need a Class C2 license.  You have to go take a course.  So people who might be good chefs and cooks can’t sell their food in the market.  Gardeners, of course, can, there’s no restrictions on them, and we try to encourage that as much as possible.  But we have a local farmer [John Wrolsen]. My wife Judith has been in e-mail contact with him.  We’ve been courting [him and his wife Denise] for a couple of years.  They have beef; they have lamb; they have veal; they’re growing vegetables.\n\nQ:  When you say local, where do you mean?\n\nBenepe:  They’re in Saugerties.  And they have a farm that’s been a farm traditionally so long that the road is named after their farm, Wrolsen Drive.  John Ralston and his sister Marianne are split up over their philosophy about what to do with farmland.  She wants to see it developed and he wants to see it farmed.  He comes to our what we call Farm Animal Day and brings his draft horses, and they’re just big animals, and brings his other animals.  \nWe asked the Wrolsens to consider selling in our local market, but we also already have a farmer from Freehold in Greene County, who raises beef, pork and lamb, whom we don’t want to lose.  \n[Short passage deleted]\nI said to John, “First get an application, and let us make a decision.”  I couldn’t get them to give us an application.\nAnd she wrote back and said, “I think we can do better just selling off the farm.”  [Short passage deleted]\nQ:  When you say rules and regulations, what kind were there when you set up the Greenmarket for people who—\n\nBenepe:  That’s a very interesting question.  First of all, what department are we going to work under when we set up Greenmarket?  The Health Department said, “If you work under the New York State Department of Ag and Markets, you can work under their regulations, which were less onerous.”\n\nQ:  Less onerous than the city?\n\nBenepe:  Than the city.  We’re just not used to dealing—because the city clamped down on outdoor markets in the 1930s.  Strangely enough, it was Mayor La Guardia who led to their demise.  Before that time—and I have a book here—the markets in the twenties invited farmers to come across [the East River from farms in Queens into Manhattan at the foot of the Queensboro Bridge].  There’s a big sign in the [1922] report of the Board of Commissioners, there’s a sign there in the marketplace saying “Farmers Only,” not peddlers, in other words.\n\tWhen [we] started Greenmarket and [Bob Lewis and]  I [were] out searching for farmers, as well as Bob was, I met a farmer in Rockland County named John Monaghan, I think it was.  He was in his mid eighties when I met him in ’75.  So therefore in 1909, I think, he would have been nineteen when the Queensboro Bridge was opened.  He told me, “I was the first farmer across that bridge.”  But it was on the return trip, because [when] he came across [in the morning by ferry], the bridge hadn’t yet opened, he came across on the ferry with his produce from Queens to the Queensboro market, which then had been established at the foot of the ferry and later at the foot of the bridge, which, interesting enough, is where we put our first Greenmarket, at the foot of that bridge.  He said that when he came over at the end of the day—they would sell wholesale basically to buyers, to stores and shopkeepers.  At the end of the day at five o’clock, they’d ring a bell and the peddlers would run forward with their pushcarts and load the pushcarts, and sell those around the city as basically end-of-the-day produce, not even a day old yet.  I don’t know how much they’d sell that day or the next, and I don’t know how often they came in, whether they came in every day or not.  I just don’t know.\n\tThen I read the account that at the Queensboro Bridge opening, they just celebrated the centenary in 2009, and they mentioned in that piece about the first farmer across.  I wrote a letter to the Times saying how I had met this farmer, I thought it’d been great, and how this basically led to the forming of Greenmarket, the same principle, farmers only.\n\nQ:  How did that lead to the—\n\nBenepe:  Well, the Times didn’t run the piece. So that the connection [of the Greenmarket] with the [1909] Queensboro market and those early roots is those peddlers out there selling food. [During the 30s] food stores, the equivalent of today’s supermarkets, objected to [the sale of] this produce out in the open.  Oh, it’s dirty and that’s not healthy.”  So La Guardia began clamping down on outdoor sales from pushcarts.  I have a book here put out by Ronni Solbert and Jean Merrill, called The Pushcart War.  It’s a wonderful book, in which the villain here is a tractor-trailer that’s pushing them off the streets.\nSo that economy of direct marketing or indirect marketing in a certain sense, where there’s farm food coming out of the pushcarts, La Guardia said, “Well, don’t worry.  I’ll treat you guys well.  I’ll build an indoor market.” He created public indoor market halls, which didn’t work because it brought the food—yes, it brought it under cover in so-called healthy conditions, but out of sight, and so nobody shopped anymore at the curb in their street.  The [curbs became dedicated to parking] trucks and cars, and not for people shopping.\nSo the concept of the last market to survive, which I actually visited and was still in existence, was the Eldridge Street market on the Lower East Side, and it was still an active marketplace, at least in the fifties, when the streets were closed on Sundays and they filled up with  pushcarts, at that time not selling so much food [as dry goods], but there were still some food peddlers here when I first moved here in the maybe late fifties, early sixties in the Village in general.  And even in Greenmarket eight, ten years ago, I was standing there and a couple came through… and she was looking over to reach for the food, and he said, “Oh, you don’t want to touch that.  It’s dirty.”  Isn’t that interesting?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBenepe:  It was still that concept of outdoor food is coated with dirt from the air.  So that concept was going against the grain to bring food out into the open again, really.  It was working against history in that sense.\n\nQ:  It seemed anti-modern or—\n\nBenepe:  Yes.  I mean, it’s certainly going against historical trends.  But I would maintain historical trends were going the wrong direction.  Everything is wrapped in plastic and put in air-conditioned rooms which are too cold to walk into even to shop.  And the source of the food was from anywhere in the world, and treated in any way you wanted.  Nobody knew anything more about it, but it met all the health rules.  It’s sort of like junk mail today.  It was junk food delivered through a mechanism which involved government promoting it, developing rules which promoted food moved [and packaged for optimum distribution], and on top of that, subsidized by an interstate highway system where the truckers didn’t pay the full cost of the highways.  You and I as taxpayers were paying for those highways.  They set up the Highway Trust Fund from fuel we use on… state roads, the city streets, and …even our lawnmowers and on the village roads and on the county roads.  All of that gas tax money went to pay for the interstate highway system, which then subsidized [food] shipments from California to New York at low cost.\nSo the system set up by government favored large farms, large irrigation projects, mega chemical projects, and, of course, in the cities, big box stores.  The people who wrote the rules were the people selling the produce.  They got into government and said, “This is what we want to make our system work.”  And so the small people were left on the outside, both the consumer and the producer.  So my attempt, as it was with planning, was to link the two together again on public space.\n\nQ:  To link which two?\n\nBenepe:  The consumer and the producer.  In this case, the farmer.  Flea markets didn’t interest me that much.  I mean, that’s another form of producer/consumer, but even the flea market people, for the most part, were not selling their own homemade goods.  They were buying stuff from China and whatever.\n\tSo that’s basically the essence of what our goals were, Bob and I and people that, you know—Barry Samuels was replaced very soon by [unclear] as director, and she was always very supportive of the concept.  Marian Heiskel… as the chairperson of the council [on the Environment of New York City], was always very supportive, and she still actively supports the concept.  So the council was the perfect choice, the Council on the Environment, to run it.\n\tThe word “Greenmarket” I thought I was inventing, until I went back to Newcastle upon Tyne on a visit, where I [had] worked as a planner [during the early 60s].  I didn’t mention that, I guess.  I didn’t mention working in Newcastle for two years as a planner.\n\nQ:  No.\n\nBenepe:  What happened was another personal reason.  With my first wife, Jagna, I took a trip on the Queen Mary in ’59 [with our infant children, Adrian and Jennifer].  She had relatives in London, and we [borrowed their] camper and traveled around Europe.  That was … when we went to see Corbusier’s work and went to Berlin for the first time, saw the work going on in the planning and architectural work in Berlin.  It was kind of idyllic days, and we stayed in the camper every day, every place we went.  So it was cheap.  And had our two children, Adrian and Jennifer.  Adrian was just about two and a half, maybe, and Jennifer was a year and a half.  We would go to Rome.  I don’t know if you know San Paolo Fuori le Muri.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBenepe:  I don’t know if I drove out there or took the train out there, and I’d take Adrian with me.  She would take Jennifer [somewhere else] and I would take Adrian, and I would sort of park Adrian in a park, and I’d go walking around the church and come back and pick him up.  He’d be playing with a pencil I’d given him, as a truck.  He was very independent.  Another case, we were in the museum at the Vatican and [we]] left them alone [again in a garden]… and we’d go upstairs, and we’d come down [later] and they’d be taken care of by some people in the museum.  [laughter]\nA third time, we were visiting Auschwitz, and we left them in the car, in the camper, to visit the camp, and we came back out and some of the people who were dressed as guards at Auschwitz were looking after them because they said it was too hot in the camper, they thought.  [laughter]  So a lot of trust there for them.\n\tSo on the way back on the Queen Mary, I met my second wife [Morag].  We weren’t in much touch then, but we were later on.  She was from Scotland.  [After Jagna and I split] … I went to England to get a planning job there in Newcastle upon Tyne [where Morag was teaching art].  My intent was to work in the new town of Peterlee in Scotland, and they had actually hired me after my first visit there, my interview.  I got over there to take the job, thinking I was hired to work in the new town.  I was really interested in the new town of Peterlee.  It was fascinating, and there were interesting architects working on it in design fashion.  It, too, is on the edge of a bluff overlooking the sea.\n\nQ:  Is it near Newcastle?\n\nBenepe:  Yes, Peterlee was southeast of Newcastle, I think—rather, southeast facing the North Sea….\nBut when I got there, they said, “We couldn’t get approval from our town manager to hire you.  I’m sorry.”\n\nQ:  Because you were American?\n\nBenepe:  I was American, and they thought I wouldn’t stay there long enough, and so they said, “Well, what we suggest you do, go [apply] to the county of Northumberland,” as this was a county too.  I went to the county of Northumberland, which was in Newcastle upon Tyne, their offices, and they said, “We can’t hire you, but you could talk to the City and County of Newcastle upon Tyne.”  Now, Newcastle upon Tyne had an interesting history because, unlike the [other] counties, which were under dukes, every duke [controlled] a duchy, the county was under the Freemen, and it was given—\n\nQ:  I didn’t know that.\n\nBenepe:  —its freedom under I don’t know which king in the tenth century or ninth century, and [the Freeman] inherited this title [and passed it down, father to son], to the present day.  And there is still the town moor in Newcastle, which [is] about a thousand acres, where they still …hold rights to pasture their cattle, which they [lease to other] farmers. Any use of the moor [including the annual agricultural fair] has to be approved by the Freemen.  Their titles were inherited.  They’re not elected….\n\tSo I was hired by the [City and] County [of Newcastle upon Tyne] where I worked as a planning officer from 1961 to 1963, and they hired me for the two reasons, one because I was American and they thought I’d bring experience for [planning] shopping centers and [designing] highways.  [laughs]  They barked up the wrong tree in that.  And so I worked with a guy named John Stabler, who is a marvelous guy.  We’re still in touch all the time.  He became the head of the department later on.  Then I became totally immersed in planning the city, which was so deep in history that I would trace its history by walking the streets, and realizing that it’s a city on a hill, facing down a very steep [embankment] as it approaches the Tyne River.  The historical texture of this city was expressed in the stairs leading down to the river, or the streets were called chares, c-h-a-r-e-s.  One of them was called Pudding Chare, and I loved the names.  Or chares were alleys [that connected streets and steps]… leading to the river.  There was a wharf and woof to the city.  The main streets which lead in one direction and the chares would lead in the other direction across on a level, so that the streets would slope down and the chares level across leading them together, like a spider web.\n\nQ:  How beautiful.\n\nBenepe:  And then it was complex because the historic roads went in different directions, and so two heart shapes would overlap each other.  So it’s kind of a complex form and made it easy to get lost in, and that quality of it gave it very dreamlike form, totally opposed to what Corbusier would do with his cities, and gave it a great sense of mystery which was related to its history, and this intrigued me enormously.  So that rather than—in fact, I was [more] interested in [them than any motorway].  I hadn’t overcome the defects of the highway they were planning.  Fortunately, the highways weren’t built yet, part of it was, and very smartly, after I left [the city] abandoned the highway concept, and brought in rail instead.  [laughter]\nWhat I concentrated on was pedestrian movements, and I would identify the pedestrian routes, and I worked with their traffic engineers to survey pedestrians rather than cars, and found out a large percentage of the people were walking into the city, not driving or taking buses.  I wanted to get an idea of where they walked from and what routes they were taking, and I wanted to identify and protect these routes from road incursions.  One of them was a winding lane which was really an old lane in back of North Terrace where Morag and I lived, which faced the town moor.  And on the other side was Royal Victoria Hospital, and this lane separated the two.  It ran along the backyards through the houses on North terrace and the hospital on the other side, and we preserved it.  I said, “You know, this is important.”  Now it’s a major walkway leading in the city.  That’s why I’m so intrigued with the High Line, which is using historic form to create a pedestrian walkway—you’ve been on it, I hope.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBenepe:  I nominated the Friends of the High Line… to get the Jane Jacobs Award, but they didn’t get it.  I hope they’ll get it one time around in future years because they really deserve it.  I think it’s the greatest concept since Central Park.  Interestingly, Fred Kent doesn’t like it at all.  [laughs]  He says, “It’s not on the ground.  It’s not where it should be,” you know.  I’ve got to take him over, because [Judith and I] were there twice yesterday, and last night it was thronged with people.\n\nQ:  Why last night?\n\nBenepe:  Because the rain stopped.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Oh, that’s a good point.  Right.\n\nBenepe:  We were there in the rain in the afternoon, and it still had a lot of people, more than on the street below.  It’s fabulous.  I don’t like the way it’s done.  I don’t like the concrete fingers, but I forgive it.  I understand why the designer did it, and having the grass peep up in the cracks and so forth, but it creates a confusing pathway, I think, and that’s why they have to put signs up saying “Don’t walk on the grass.”  They wouldn’t have had to put the signs up if they designed it properly in the first [place].  I’m also feeling ambivalent about the thin rusty steel containers holding the raised planters.\n\nQ:  I have to go see it.\n\nBenepe:  I understand why they’re using steel.  It’s a railway architecture.  But what also relates to it, they do use wood for some of the decks, which they say is imported from Brazil, which is questionable, Brazilian forests and all, but the railroad-tie language might have played a stronger role in design, and might have been used to contain the planting beds.  I don’t know how I would have approached it.\n\nQ:  It’s complicated.\n\nBenepe:  Yes.  The fact is, this is a linear movement for walking, not for trains, and the linear quality is important, and there’s like there’s an ambivalence there.  Those fingers sort of stop you visually, and so you’re sort of avoiding them to keep walking up, and literally those parks are for walking.  There’s not much sitting.  There’s some.  I mean, it’s a nice place to sit and watch the crowd go by, too.  But it’s great charm.  It’s exposure to the sky and to the river, as well as it’s interlacing between the backs of buildings, and looking down the streets below  that glass wall [at the south end stops you] suddenly end where you say, “Oh, I’m going to fall off this edge,” because the edge stops abruptly at the glass.  It’s really a wonderful mannered thing to do.  And the treatments to the railing there, there’s just a little bar joining them and the glass, you wonder what’s holding that glass up.  You look down and it’s embedded in concrete underneath.  There’s no post.  The railing isn’t supporting it.  It links them and that’s all.  So there are certain magical things done about it.\n\tSo Newcastle was an exposure to history, but more importantly, getting to Greenmarket, is when I went back to visit Newcastle with Judith, we’ve been back several times, and I went to see John Stabler, my fellow planner, and he [asked] when [we] went to visit him at the Newcastle Planning Department, “Have you been to see what’s happened to our greenmarket?” \n\tAnd I said, “Oh, that’s where the word came from.”  [laughs]  Greenmarket in England is a generic word, and it means a plant market, not vegetables.\n\nQ:  I didn’t know that.  I did not know that.\n\nBenepe:  And there’s a road sign up in Newcastle with big letters saying “Greenmarket,” pointing down, and it’s near the railroad station.  It’s been moved.  It used to be a big market hall near the road, so a classical market hall.  Now it’s in a more modern building.  That’s what he meant when he said, “Did you go see our new greenmarket?”\n\nQ:  And inside there would be?\n\nBenepe:  Plants and flowers, that’s all.  No vegetables.  They still have the indoor Granger Market.  In Newcastle that is where you would go to buy fruits and vegetables and other foods and other products.  They have dried products there as well.  I was never too happy with the Granger Market because they mixed up foods and dry goods, so you have nice frilly dresses next to chunks of meat.  I didn’t think they worked too well.  [laughs]  It was an interesting statement.  But that’s where you shop for food, in the Granger Market.\n\nQ:  Traditionally?\n\nBenepe:  Traditionally, and there was the—no.  Today.  The Granger Market is still running.  There are other markets.  There is a market, the outdoor market, two famous outdoor markets.  One was on the streets leading down to the waterfront—its name [Bigg Market] will come to me—and they sold foods.  [Bigg, an ancient word meaning grain.] And then the Sunday Keyside market sold foods, but the Quayside market, like the other market I’m not remembering, were sort of open-air markets; they weren’t just food. [The Quay is the stone bulkhead along the Tyne, where the ships have docked since Roman times].\n\nQ:  And you obviously saw those when you were living there.\n\nBenepe:  Sure.  But for me, Newcastle was the history and the tradition going back, and of course, the chance to do contemporary planning.  Why I returned to the United States was I wasn’t making enough money to support my children who were over here, Adrian and Jennifer, [who were] living with [Jagna in the U.S.].  My eleven hundred [pounds (about $5000)] a year wasn’t stretching.\nSo I came back here to work, and I think that’s when I first began my planning work here.\n\nQ:  As an independent office?\n\nBenepe:  No. During the mid 60s I spent 4 years working for the New York City Housing and Redevelopment Board under Sam Ratensky, chiefly on the West Side Urban Renewal Plan, on which I had worked from 1959-61. I didn’t become independent until leaving Bob Weinberg, and that would have been in the early seventies.  So between coming back here in—that would be—I think I—bringing these dates together—\n\nQ:  We can check that.  But the idea is that you came back and [eventually] worked for Weinberg?\n[Answer deleted]\n\nQ:  Were you married when you came back?\n\nBenepe:  Yes.  I married in Scotland.  My [second] wife Morag was Scottish.  Her mother came from Aberdeen.  The reason I went to Newcastle, she was teaching in Newcastle at Kings College.  She was an artist and teaching sculpture and work in clay.  Her mother came from Aberdeen, and she considered her mother being Aberdeen kind of more common Scottish, [while] her father was an architect [from Balloch] she considered more aristocratic who spoke …. spoke better English than the English.  So she was kind of a snob about where she was from in Scotland.\nSo I thought it was really necessary to come back after we married, to come back here, and get a job where I could [help] support my two children and raise a family here.\nWhen I was married to Jagna, we lived in New Rochelle [during the mid 50s], and that’s where we raised Adrian and Jennifer, and took our trip to Europe from there.  So the trip to Europe would have been in ’59.  [I left my family in 1961 when I moved to Newcastle, returning to NYC in 1963 to work for the NYC Housing and Redevelopment Board]. \n[Passage about where he worked when he came back from England deleted]\n\nThen through the Housing and Redevelopment Board I learned about the opportunity, there was a fellow planner there who told me about the opportunity to work [as Planning Director] in Newburgh, New York.  I was very fascinated with that because the [New York Times] had written a story about Newburgh, showing how deeply it was involved in the urban problems.\n\nQ:  In the New York Times?\n\nBenepe:  Yes, and they showed views of the old city of Newburgh, with these cobbled streets, and I was very fascinated with it.  It was like Newcastle all over again.  Here is this city with a great history being exposed to urban renewal.  So I applied for the job as the head of the Planning Department, and initially I was in charge of both planning and urban renewal, but at that point they were separating urban renewal from planning, and I remained the chief planner and urban renewal was being brought under a man named John [Stillman].  He was very highly politically connected with Hubert Humphrey and the Democrats at that time, and he was independently wealthy, so when they hired him, they probably didn’t have to pay him.  He headed the urban renewal agency.  He hired a consultant in the mid sixties then to develop an urban renewal plan, and I, as a planner, was a little bit alarmed at this plan, because it was wiping out a lot of the historic texture of the town, of the city.  I was involved with a group called the Friends of Newburgh.\n\nQ:  Of course.\n\nBenepe:  We were trying to preserve the historic character.  So as a planning director, I went to testify at the hearing [held by the urban Renewal Agency, chaired by John Stillman] on the urban renewal plan, and I named thirty-three historic properties.  A lot of work there was by A.J. Downing and A.J. Davis both, and [Calvert Vaux, who designed Central Park with Frederick Law Olmsted]\n\nBenepe:  The authority [George Tatum] on [Calvert Vaux] had said this architect’s best house [the Hodge Funeral Home, the former W.E. Warren House] was in Newburgh, of all the work in the country, and this was one of the houses slated for demolition.  So when I went to this public hearing… I gave this list of thirty-three houses scheduled for demolition, which should be saved, and it was the headline of the local newspaper the next day.  When I finished my testimony and I walked behind John’s table, he turned around to me and he said, “Drop dead.”  [laughs]  Wonderful comments.\nOne of the buildings that was slated to be removed was a church by A.J. Davis, which is an enormous Greek revival [temple].  It looked like the front of the five-dollar bill, just total pure classicism, with very tall Ionic columns and vaulted interior.  It had been abandoned.  It was in really terrible shape.  The church was the Dutch Reform Church, and they had abandoned it and they had built a new church in the suburbs outside of Newburgh.  So it was really important in my mind to save this.\nThe successor to John, [Stillman] a new man came on named Jack Present, and he said, “I’m dedicated to getting that building down.”  He said, “The last thing I’m going to do is tear it down”\n\tAnd I said, “The last thing I’m going to do is keep it up.”  And I managed. Our private group, which we formed a Greater Newburgh Arts Council, we had support from the Chamber of Commerce because they wanted to keep business downtown as well.  We applied for a grant to do a preservation study, and we did.  We did it ourselves, and got the east end of Newburgh put on the state historic district, to protect it.  So that ended up protecting the core of the early Gothic architecture.\n\nQ:  So this was always on your mind, was protecting the historic places?\n\nBenepe:  Right.  But that also exposed me to the farm community outside Newburgh, and at that time, since I was already now doing research in historic preservation, I was hired by a guy on the county level to [survey and photograph] at the county historic resources and help him with his survey, and that led me to looking at farms [in Orange County].  So this sort of broadened my view, seeing things on a regional scale.  At the same time I kept my connections with the people in New York City, I think.\n\nQ:  So when did you return to New York?\n\nBenepe:  Why did I return?  Well, a new regime came on in Newburgh.  Strangely enough, even though I was hired by a Democratic administration, three [Democrats] to two [Republicans], and I worked under a really great city manager who was hired by the Democrats, the new election brought on the Republicans, and [initially] I was a darling of the Republicans because I fought urban renewal, which they were against, too.  They were against it for a different reason than I was.  They saw the east end of Newburgh, which is where the history was, as a place to keep the black population—\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nBenepe:  —which had settled in there.  Meanwhile, I was working also to move blacks into the west end, where we were building new housing.  I was working with another regional group there, [Patterns for Progress, that was] … working on a regional level and they wanted to broaden the concept of public housing and embody the public housing into a larger mixed-income housing project, which I as a [City] Planner wanted to do as well.  So I was supporting them as the head planner and promoting this to our planning board.\nWe had a really good planning board.  Steve Kent was the chair, and he was very supportive of the work I was doing.  His wife was very active.  We were all sort of an underground movement to champion—he championed what I wanted to do with the preservation and good planning and this new overall plan [for the Lake Street Project] up in the east end of Newburgh around [the Muchatto’s] lake up there.  I wanted to create this lake as a centerpiece for new development.  Again it was the same thing I was trying to do with Al Smith houses [in NYC].  I wanted to pull the community into this new [mixed income] development and create shopping there that people would come to.\n\tI discovered in the meantime there was a greenway on the western end of Newburgh, which was laid out as a 9A bypass for a highway.  I argued we should keep this as a greenway, not as a highway, and keep 9A where it was, as it was going through the city, which it still is today.  I’m not sure quite what happened to the greenway, but it was again looking beyond and linking the city [to the rural region around it].  There is a bluff at the south end of the city which I wanted to link with the greenway system.  There were railroad tracks I wanted to link with it.  So there are people there now who are still trying to do the same thing.  There was Moodna Creek, which had a greenway leading down to the Hudson River.  I wanted to develop the river access, to the river.\nSo I was looking at all these broad planning goals, but then when the new administration came in, the Republicans wanted to get rid of me because I was pushing the [mixed income] project [on Muchatto’s Lake] to the west.  They couldn’t fire me because I was civil service, so they abolished my job title.  So they held hearings on the abolition of my title at the same time as they held hearings on this Lake Street plan, called Lake Street, because that’s where it was.  So an enormous crowd turned out to both support keeping me on at the public hearings and to keep the project on the books.  But in the meantime, they did abolish my job, I was fired, and I made a big newspaper story out of it.  They actually had to remove the lock from my door so I couldn’t get in.  The city manager had to do that.  So I had the press come in showing the hole in the door, and me trying to put the key in the hole, you know, making a great story of it.\nSo when my job was abolished, and I looked for work elsewhere and left [Newburgh to return to New York], the first place I moved to was West 95th Street, and that was where urban renewal area where I had been working on the urban renewal area.  So I was able to be in the area I was working.\nI got active in a lot of issues through planning boards.  I was on Planning Board 7 for a while.  I had a co-planner, [Irving] Schwartz…..  We were both co-chairs of the Traffic Committee, and we worked very hard to get cars out of Central Park, which step by step we did.  Tom Hoving was the parks commissioner then, and John Lindsay was the mayor, and he was pretty sympathetic to our goals.  What we did was worked through another group called Transportation Alternatives, which I helped found.  T.A. was advancing the idea of getting cars out of the Central Park drives, and we did it initially by—one thing that was happening was under the blessing of the Parks Department was bike races in the park on, I think, two weekends a summer.  And what we did is we brought our groups together to be at the back end of the bike race and to block off the drives from the cars getting in.\n\nQ:  You wanted to block the cars all the time?\n\nBenepe:  Well… on Sundays to start with.  What we did is we put letters on our backs, which we rode in the right position, that said “SUNDAY CAR BAN,” and then the cyclists got mixed up, so all the letters got mixed up, and that made the papers as a kind of a joke as “SUN CAR BAN DAY.”.\nI think we had two demonstrations.  There was a second one which became more formal, where it wasn’t tied into the bike race, but we just went out and did it.  I’m not sure whether we got a permit or not, but we got [Congressman Bill Ryan and City Councilman Ed Koch and] Ted Weiss [and State Senator Mike Seymour] to join in.  We brought in a horse and carriage and an electric golf cart.  I think we put Congressman [Ryan] in the front in the electric golf cart.  We wanted to show non-auto ways of using the park, and kind of cleaning the air.  We brought in the Clean Air Coalition, and they did air-quality measurements. \nSo we spearheaded this whole movement, and then I began writing articles in the Westsider newspaper about improving the parks, improving the playgrounds, getting better designs for the playgrounds, better maintenance, that the Parks Department itself was causing damage by driving their trucks on the grass and going off the paths and things.\n\nQ:  When was all this?\n\nBenepe:  This would have been in the sixties, I’m pretty sure.\n\nQ:  Of course.  It was Lindsay.\n\nBenepe:  I also demonstrated against the enlargement of the Metropolitan Museum of Art at the back.\n\nQ:  Into the park?\n\nBenepe:  Yes.  Although they had sort of title to that land, but it was not necessary to expand into it, but that’s what they had in mind, I guess.  They could have done worse.  They did a good job of it.  They could have done a better job and created an entrance in the park, which would have been nice.  Maybe the Park Department didn’t want that, I don’t know.\n\tSo I was very involved in the park through the Community Board Seven, and I might have been not only on the Traffic Committee, but on the Parks Committee as well.  I lived first on 107th Street and then moved to 95th Street, north side.  At some point I joined Community Board 5 in midtown, and that’s because my office was on 41st Street, when I worked for Weinberg.  So things just started moving forward through those eras.  The two planning boards kept me very … Manhattan-based. …\n\nQ:  Was that all volunteer?\n\nBenepe:  Yes, everything was volunteer.  I did work as a consultant, by the way, to Community Board 5, not Community Board 7.  For Community Board 5 I worked as a consultant on looking at the impact of plazas in the city and how they’re created and what benefits they had, and how they were chosen for location and what impact they had on creating use of open space in the city.  \n\nQ:  Could you describe then how this commitment to useful open spaces in the city related to your desires for how to set up the Greenmarket?\n\nBenepe:  Well, the first sites were selected by gratuitous connection with our [primary] funder, which was the J.M. Kaplan Fund.  [Their Executive Director] Suzanne Davis said, “There’s an empty lot near where I live.  Why don’t you look at that.”  [laughs]  So the empty lot turned out to be a fifty-five-by-two-hundred-foot lot [purchased] by the city, and some tension when the city purchased it was to have built approach roads to the bridge, the Queensboro Bridge, which never materialized because they built the tramway instead.  So it was being used partly by the Police Department to park their personal cars there, under a contract the P. B. A. had to use unused city-owned land.\n\tThey apparently, without my approaching them directly, agreed to this because the Council on the Environment was a fortuitous choice to do this program, because the Council on the Environment’s board was made up of representatives of businesses and city agencies, and therefore the mayor’s office, and the mayor sat as co-chair of the council [with Marian Heiskell].  Abraham Beame, Abe Beame was the co-chair then, and so we were able to go directly to the mayor’s office, and Barbara Reach, who represented the mayor’s office on Council on the Environment to, [obtained permission] to use this city-owned space for a market?  And, of course, being the mayor, the city agencies agreed, even though the Transportation Department really didn’t—then it was the Highway Department—didn’t really like the idea, but agreed.\nSo we had a fenced-in lot a block from Bloomingdale’s to put in a market, and the fact that it was a block from Bloomingdale’s and fenced in and free of anything inside, the police agreed—I guess the mayor’s office got them to agree on this—to move [their cars] on Saturdays [during the summer]. \n\nQ:  You mean it was still a parking lot except Sundays?\n\nBenepe:  For the Police Department, yes, and this was Saturdays, by the way, we opened this market, not Sundays.  So we opened the market on Saturday at 59th Street and Second Avenue, where the tram is.\n\nQ:  And the police cars were not there?\n\nBenepe:  They moved them for that day and [each Saturday during the summer].  They probably took them home, because they mainly needed them when they were commuting to work to park them.  They call them unmarked police cars.  [laughs]\nAnd then it was used by contractors for the tramway I think, part of it, half of it, then half the police, so we had to work around them.  I think we used half the lot for a while, and then we got the whole lot, and I think we were there for maybe one or two or three years.\nThere was a local group [Community Board Six] there headed up by a woman named Joanna Battaglia, who was a member of the board of the—Judith knew her [later as Chair of  the Parks Council, for whom she worked as director]. … She would go to the Hamptons during the summer, but when she came back, she wanted to see that market out of there.  [laughs]  So she would holler and scream about having this market there, and we were only there for the summer as it was, and so we weren’t there too late into the fall.  …\nThere was a woman who was the head of the 59th Street Association who had come over with cameras and take pictures of our farmers with their empty crates, and say, “Isn’t this terrible, these empty crates sitting here in this lot?”  And take it to the planning board to dissuade the people, this awful use of the lot and how it’s cheapening the area of having this outdoor market. \n\nQ:  Well, that turned out to be wrong, didn’t it?  [laughter]\n\nBenepe:  And the farmers, when they first came, we didn’t make rules and regulations.  I didn’t, first of all, think any farmers would come in.  I was prepared to send vans out to the farms to bring in the produce, and we gradually learned that the farmers would be willing to come in on their own steam.  Bob Lewis was the one to make these contacts and bring them in, and he also made contacts with the [County] Cooperative Extension Service.  He worked with the county level [in each country in the surrounding region, both New York and new Jersey].\n\tThen we had no rules and regulations.  All we required was that 25 percent of what they brought in was raised on the farm, and [sold by]…farmers themselves.  But the first week at 59th Street, a farmer brought in bananas.  I said, “What are you doing with these bananas?”\n\tHe said, “Well, I thought I could get them, and bring them in.”  Another week he brought in a load of toys.  He said, “I had them in the attic.  I thought I could sell these toys.”  So we realized we had to begin to develop rules.\n\nQ:  You had to establish rules.\n\nBenepe:  Yes.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBenepe - 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Barry Benepe\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t  Session #2\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t    New York City\n\nDate:  July 13, 2009\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It’s July 13, 2009, and I’m with Barry Benepe at his home in Greenwich Village.  We’re about to start our second interview.\nNice to see you again.\n\nBenepe:  Good afternoon.\n\nWeinraub:  We managed to get up to the beginning of the Greenmarket when we spoke before, and there we are in a lot at Second Avenue, behind Bloomingdale’s.  So can you describe that first summer and go from there?\n\nBenepe:  The important thing is we waited until late in the summer to start the market, because we wanted to make sure that when the market opened, that we had a full range of products that people wanted to buy.  So we opened, I think it was no earlier than July, when corn was in, tomatoes, and summer squash and things like that.  We opened with nine vendors.  Four of those were non-produce vendors; they were plants and one person came in mistakenly with toys from his attic and didn’t realize we were a farmers’ market, so we didn’t put them out.  I think he had other things.  It was then that we decided we had to establish rules for the market, and at that time we thought that we would have to go out to the farm and buy produce.  We didn’t think farmers would come in.  It turned out they would.  Then we required them to have 25 percent of the produce to be off their farm and the rest could be purchased from neighboring farms.  That was the beginning of the market.\n\tFifty-ninth Street was selected as the site, or recommended as the site by a funder, the executive director then of the J.M. Kaplan Fund, Suzanne Davis, and she said, “Oh, there’s this lot near where I live,” which happened to be perfect for a market, and it turned out the city owned it, and because the Council on the Environment, which ran the program, had city agencies on its board, including the mayor, we were able to get cooperation from the city in getting the lot.  The lot was small and we had never worked at laying out a market before; this was our first.\n\nWeinraub:  Did you have to pay for it at all?\n\nBenepe:  No.  That was the great thing about being with Council on the Environment; we had no costs for any of our sites.  The cost was really for staff, to staff them, and fixed costs for materials.  We began in a very modest way, myself and Bob Lewis and our t-shirts, and my family members helped.  My daughter was there and some of my children, working at tables.  They worked as volunteers.  Initially, in terms of our finances, we had raised $15,000 the first year towards the $34,000 grant request, our budget, which was encouraging enough to start off and pay ourselves a [modest] salary.\n\nWeinraub:  How many weeks did you—\n\nBenepe:  That first year?\n\nWeinraub:  Yes.\n\nBenepe:  We opened up three markets that first year.  Fifty-Ninth Street was the first market.  Then I was contacted by Margot Wellington of Municipal Arts Society, who lived in Brooklyn and very much wanted a market in Brooklyn, and she recommended a site at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues.  When I looked at it, I thought it was terrible.  The city owned that site too.  It was across from the [L.I.R.R.] railroad station.  Brooklyn Academy of Music is not far away from there.\n\nWeinraub:  Atlantic Avenue.\n\nBenepe:  Yes.  It’s on the Long Island Railroad line, I think, stop.  So there’s commuter traffic there, a lot of people driving by, but nobody walking by the site, so it seemed like an uphill battle to get people to come, but they did.  It was a hot, barren site covered with coarse stone; it was unpleasant to walk on.  Had a high chain-link fence around it, was triangular in shape, which is a very odd shape to work with.  It was basically a parking lot..\n\nWeinraub:  Had she been to the Fifty-Ninth Street market?\n\nBenepe:  Margot?\n\nWeinraub:  Yes.  What interested her—\n\nBenepe:  Probably had.  She was interested in the program even before we opened.  She had wanted to be the sponsor, Municipal Arts Society, but we really approached the Council on Environment of New York City first.  I’m glad we did, because they had the resources to pull it off, where MAS would not have had it.  When I said resources, they had people on their board who worked for the city and cooperated with us, and that was a big plus.\n\tThe third site was Union Square, and that happened because the head of the Manhattan Planning Office for the city Planning Department, Mithoo Baxter, she heard about us.  One of the interesting things about when the market opened at Fifty-ninth Street, I worked hard on making press contacts, and somehow we were able to persuade one of the major channels, news networks, to come by, and they did.  When it appeared on television, everybody knew about it.  Then the city began getting calls from outside, from farmers and other people who were wanting markets, and the city didn’t know how to field these calls because they really didn’t know about us either, because we weren’t really a city program.\n\nQ:  Were you surprised that there was this much response so quickly?\n\nBenepe:  We were pleased.  I was surprised on getting the publicity and very fortunate in that, because not only did one channel come down, I think Channel 2, later on Channels 5 and 7 also came to markets, and they would tack this on to their news programs and it would be like a cheerful wrap-up at the end, to give something pleasant to say about the city.  So this was good.  It put us in the right position in the city diary, and of course more people learned about us that way.\nSo that when Mithoo Baxter saw us and the city was involved then in trying to revive Union Square, which was really in the doldrums, S. Klein’s, a major store, had closed, and they were doing their best to rescue the square.  They had already produced a report that year, showing the future of Union Square, and the site which we selected for the market, and they helped us select, was shown as tennis courts.  I said, “I think you should redo your plan and show this as a farmers’ market,” which they did.  They proceeded then to notify the other city agencies.\nAt that time the Parks Department didn’t control the site; it was controlled by the Highway Department.  At that time there was no Department of Transportation; it was Highway and Traffic.  So we had to deal with two different agencies.  They were using it as a parking lot, and its history as a parking lot went way back to the 19-teens.  It had always been used for parking.  In the 1934 Public Works Guide to New York, it listed Union Square North as a parking lot.  However, its true history was as a public place which was created in 1811, when the first map was made.  I have some wonderful records of it, where the surveyor [and map maker, John Randel, Jr.] was cutting his way through wildlife to try to survey the land.  It was that wild then.\n\nQ:  It was trees and—\n\nBenepe:  Yes, shrubbery.  He talks about that.  I have a report in which he discusses it.  It’s called The D. T. Valentine Manual of 1964, which is a beautiful manual. Adrian gave me this copy.  In it Randel discusses surveying Union Square, and he describes being at Sixteenth Street and Union Square West, which is just where we started the market.\n\nQ:  How much time was there between Fifty-ninth Street, Brooklyn, and—\n\nBenepe:  Very little.  Everything happened within a period of two months, within two months of each other.\n\nQ:  So how did you and Bob manage?\n\nBenepe:  Well, we were on the phone a lot.  We called farmers and we called the city agency people necessary to help us.  So there was a lot of arranging.  Then, of course, publicity’s important, so we would crank out news releases and flyers and distribute flyers.  For the first ten or fifteen years, the market, the job was always how do you let people know that we have a market.  So there was constant outreach to the community in various ways, attending conferences, meetings, going to community boards, just getting the word out.\nThe most important factors in making a successful market, over and above all those other attempts, is visibility and imageability, which are two different things.  Visibility is you see it when you walk by.  Imageability is when you say the name, people know where it is.\n\nQ:  Is that a technical term?\n\nBenepe:  No, it’s one I made up.  It comes from Kevin Lynch, who wrote Image of the City.  So that when I say “Times Square” to you, you can picture Times Square.  I don’t have to give you directions.  If I tell you “Bryant Park,” I’m probably going to have to give you directions….Broadway has a strong image.  Everybody can find Broadway, no matter where they live.\n\nQ:  Except taxi drivers.  [laughter]\n\nBenepe:  Probably.  So we tried to find places that were, say, a block from Bloomingdale’s.  That gives people a good idea of where it might be.  It was also at the foot of the tramway, so people who knew about the tramway or the Queensboro Bridge could get an image of where we were, which made certain locations very difficult.  We had one that was offered to us behind a church on East Sixty-eighth Street, and there was no way in the world to tell people where that was.  You could give the name of the church, but that didn’t mean much.  So it was a difficult market to get off the ground.  We put maps in our flyers and things like that.  But Union Square was a cinch.  Everybody knew where Union Square was.\n\tFlatbush, Atlantic, for people in Brooklyn wasn’t such a big hump, and it was certainly visible, but mainly to people driving.\n\nQ:  Why do you think people wanted more markets, besides the farmers?\n\nBenepe:  That’s a really good question.  I’m not sure if people did want more markets.  I think when they saw them, they found them likeable.  What was interesting about Fifty-ninth Street, that was a gated site, so we kept the gate closed while setting it up, and because the use of the site had changed from a parking lot to a human activity, it made people curious as they walked by, so that within a space of two or there weeks, they were lining outside the gate, waiting to get in, because they knew this was going on.  They could see it when they walked by.  That’s really important.  That has to do with imageability as well as visibility, the passing-by bit.  They both go together.\n\tWhen we started a market in Washington Heights later in later years, in the eighties, we were shown the site in a valley surrounded by high-rise public housing and filling stations, very depressing looking area, and the …Washington Heights/Inwood  Association, tried to get us to go down there because it was a slummy area.  They thought this would help clean it up.  I said, “No, this is really undesirable.  I don’t want to be here, and I don’t think other people want to come there.  So let’s walk around and look for what might be nice.”  We walked up to Broadway, and there up above 175th Street was, unlike the other streets, was wider.  It was 100 feet wide rather than 60.  It had a very easy way [for farmers] to get in there and parking, and the other thing that let to its imageability was the former—I think it was the Roxy Theater.  It was one of the old big movie palaces, which had been turned into a church at that time.  It was Reverend Ike’s church.  So that had a marvelous presence, so you felt you were some place.  I have postcards of the famous markets in Europe.  They were [often] on the cathedral squares.  If you said you were in front of a certain cathedral, people knew where you were.  So this had that kind of a presence.\nSo we were trying to be careful.  We had many requests for markets which we wanted to honor, because we were constantly looking for new outlets, and the people who wanted the markets wanted them where they were.  So the market at 137th Street was in front of Harlem Teens for Self-Help, which was run by Minerva Coleman, who is a real go-getter.  Minerva is one of these devoted, driven, intelligent, passionate people who love their community and wanted to do the best she could for it, and she thought a market would be just what they needed, because they needed food they could afford and needed in their diets.  It was her commitment which made it work.  She made sure to get people there, get her neighbors.  She said, “This is an unsafe neighborhood for anybody to live in.  Apartment hallways are broken into, and security is important.  This helps improve security.  This makes us feel like a neighborhood.”  So her leadership and support made it work.\nThis was true in many cases. [In Brooklyn, the Brooklyn Heights Association director Tony Manheim] … was very supportive and helped us get started [in downtown Brooklyn at two locations].  A second market in Brooklyn, which ended up being in front of the courthouse, was because of the Brooklyn Heights Association wanting us, and then we ended up also going in front of Borough Hall [on Saturdays].  Borough Hall has a very strong image.  This was Fulton Street, where the trolley used to be.  So a lot of attention [had been] devoted to [creating] this space, and it showed it, so was a natural for us.\nStrange happening at the courthouse.  These two locations were near each other, but they were different days.  The administrative judge in the court wanted us out of there.  He said, “It’s not appropriate to have a market activity in front of a courthouse.”  Said, “People might slip on a banana peel.”  We didn’t sell bananas, you know.  [laughter]  But he just thought it was “demeaning to the court,” is the word he used.  So we had a meeting with him and brought another judge to the meeting, who was very highly respected.  I don’t recall his name, but he was unusual; he was blind, so he couldn’t see the market, but he really experienced it.  He argued to have it there, and over the administrative judge’s objections, the market did open in front of the courthouse.\n\nQ:  That was approximately when?\n\nBenepe:  I’d say approximately 1982.\n\nQ:  Where was the John McPhee piece?\n\nBenepe:  That was early on.  That was like ’77.\n\nQ:  Could you tell me how that happened?\n\nBenepe:  That happened because of Bob Lewis, again.  We were a great team because he had very good strengths, and he’d read John McPhee’s books and he loved his work, and he contacted him.  John McPhee really cottoned onto the idea and came down and he spent time at the market.  I think he visited farms as well.  He was terrific, and Bob was brilliant in bringing him there.\n\nQ:  What kind of reaction was there from the public after that piece?\n\nBenepe:  Not only from the public; it was reprinted in the Congressional Record.  It got into the Congressional Record [by a] congressman from California—McPhee’s piece was published also in New Yorker magazine under the name “Giving Good Weight.’.\n\nQ:  Originally, yes.\n\nBenepe:  Right.  So the congressman in California read this in the New Yorker, and he said, “We should be doing this in California.”  California got off to a rousing state program of farmers’ markets.  There was a woman there whose name I don’t remember—it may come back to me—who was really gung-ho in establishing markets.  She was such a vital person and so attractive and so devoted.\n\nQ:  I can ask Gus Schumacher.  He may know.\n\nBenepe:  Yes, he probably will remember her. [Or Bob Lewis may]. There was a lot of back and forth between us.  I was going to conferences on the West Coast, and people were coming here.  There was a very strong ground—what’s the word?\n\nQ:  Groundswell.\n\nBenepe:  Groundswell among communities around the country.  Baltimore had a woman from Brooklyn who ran the Baltimore farmers’ market.  Went down to see their market, and their market was by far the largest single farmers’ market in the country, had 125 vendors.\n\nQ:  Where was that?\n\nBenepe:  Judith may remember.\n\nQ:  Near the Washington monument?\n\nBenepe:  No, it wasn’t in a very imageable place.  It was hard to find, I remember.  There was one market I went to that was under elevated railroad tracks or an elevated highway.  Baltimore had a couple of markets.  It had a traditional wholesale market where the farmers’ trucks came in and sold off the trucks, but it’s not that market I’m speaking of.\n\nQ:  That was covered, the wholesale market.\n\nBenepe:  I thought those were trucks selling off the tracks, as I remember going there.  There was maybe some inside, some outside.  Could have been.  Maybe what happened there is that the wholesalers were inside and the farm trucks were selling on the street, which is not dissimilar to the Bronx Terminal Market, which we had farmers who came down from Orange County, who came to Greenmarket, also went to Bronx Terminal Market. [One of the farmers there, Hoeffner Farm,] also Bronx Terminal Market.  So the father [Jack], went to Bronx Terminal and sold wholesale from his truck.  The son [Phil] came to Greenmarket and sold retail from his truck there.\n\nQ:  How interesting.\n\nBenepe:  The Hoeffners are no longer with us, as far as I know.  I don’t know why.  They’re Orange County farmers.  But other farmers, [including Rich Hodgson and Don Keller have been coming since the first year.]  I just talked to Rich Hodgson last week.  If you ever want to talk to somebody else to get a sense of continuity, he’d be good to talk to.  We have three generations of family members now at the markets, because Rich Hodgson, whose father is Dick Hodgson, and Dick died a few years ago, and Rich Hodgson’s son, I think, is involved in the markets, so three generations involved.  And Rich Hodgson’s already an older man, an old gray-haired man.  He was a young boy when I first met him.\n\nQ:  These markets are here?\n\nBenepe:  Yes.  Rich Hodgson is here in Union Square.  I think he’ll be here Wednesday.  The Binaghis, and Van Houtens have been with the Greenmarket since before 1980. There are maybe six to seven farmers who’ve stayed in since the beginning.\n\nQ:  Of those original—\n\nBenepe:  Yes, of the original.  As I say, originally there were only nine at Fifty-Ninth Street, and four of those were dealing with flowers, not other plants and other things.  But the vegetable and fruit expanded rapidly, and also interest was there.\n\tThe other changes that took place, I’m both exploding and compressing the experiences, is that the market was initially very seasonable.  As I said, we opened late in the summer because we discovered the following year that if we opened too soon, there wasn’t anything to offer, just greens, lettuces.  People still—I’ve seen in Greenmarket educated, smart, well-dressed, well-to-do people come looking for oranges and don’t understand why we don’t have them.  So that there’s a constant education process in what is the farmers’ market.  So they’re disappointed when they don’t see corn and tomatoes in June, but now generally the buying public understands seasons and they respond to seasonality. [Gradually we broadened our selection to include grains, baked products, maple syrup, honey, cheese, milk, fish, poultry, meat and other products].\n\tThen the other thing is that after we’d been open a while, we reached way beyond our limited Orange County farmers and northern New Jersey and reached out into southern New Jersey, and there you’re getting crops a whole month earlier, [and into the Finger lakes for grapes, wine and vinegar].\n\nQ:  You mean as you needed more farmers for the additional markets?\n\nBenepe:  And more and more farmers heard about us.  We would go to conferences attended by farmers, so we were not only spreading the word to our colleagues in the farmers’ market world, but also to farmers in the region.\n\nQ:  What kind of conferences?\n\nBenepe:  The conferences were generally direct marketing conferences.  Then occasionally there would be conferences just for growers, growers searching out new markets for their food.  So we’d make a plug for Greenmarket at those conferences.\nOne of our first southern New Jersey growers, [Frank Stiles], became the subject for one of our major posters we used.  It’s of a farmer holding this big basket of greens, and the painting for the poster was made by a colleague [Joel Specter] who I shared my office with.  He had a studio on the same floor and the same room, Joel Spector.  He made this illustration of a farmer holding this basket of greens, and that became our big poster for that year and maybe succeeding years.  He was a southern New Jersey farmer, so he was able to come in early and beat the other farmers in the Hudson Valley who felt the pressure of competition.  So they were finding ways of competing, specializing in certain crops.  One of our growers said, “I want to buy a farm in Florida and I’d like to bring up oranges from my farm and take down apples to Florida in season.”  And we debated that, should we do it or not do it, and we said, no, we really should keep to our region.  We had the same issue with Finger Lakes farmers.  Finger Lakes being 250 miles away was a long journey for small organic farmers, and they seem to have also small farms, sometimes five acres or less.\nSo the proposal was, well, let them come in as a co-op and sell off one truck, maybe four or five farmers, and the criteria for allowing them in would be, one, they’re organic, two, they’re small farmers, and three, they’re 250 miles away.  But our Farmer Consumer Advisor Committee wouldn’t go along with that.  They didn’t want that competition.\n\nQ:  Were all the farms organic at that point?\n\nBenepe:  Oh no.  First of all, organic was never a goal of our market.  That became self-impelled by the organic growers themselves.  They wanted to make themselves attractive.  I have never had a bias towards organic just simply because getting locally grown food is difficult enough.  I don’t want to get too fussy.  Secondly, what’s important is the flavor, the variety, the freshness, the maturity.  All of those things have nothing to do with whether it’s organic or not.  The differences between organic and non-organic are not that great, because the conventional farmers we’re talking about are not industrial farms.  They’re not using high amounts of chemicals because they’re too expensive to use.\n\nQ:  You talk about committees related to the Greenmarket.  So explain what the general staffing was and what kind of board eventually developed.\n\nBenepe:  Well, the concept of the Farmer Consumer Advisory Committee evolved from a man and wife farmer from Cream Ridge, New Jersey, the Etgens, Arlene and Bob Etgen.  They were complaining about farmers doing things that they thought weren’t kosher.  So they said we should tighten our rules and have a Farmer Consumer Advisory Committee going over potential violations and referring the violations to staff and seeing they’re carried out.\nThe irony was that one of the first people brought up on violations were the Etgens for buying things that weren’t theirs, because we went to visit their farm, they didn’t find much there.  They were penalized and they finally dropped out of the market.\n\nQ:  What did they do?  They bought from other farmers and brought it down?\n\nBenepe:  I’m not sure where they got it from.  A lot of the buying that goes on can be other farms.  It can be people going to a local auction block.  In the case of New York State, some people were going to… a large auction block in Menands, New York, outside of Albany, where the farmers were both selling and buying.  They would go up there with stuff from their farm and sell it and then they would buy things from other farmers and bring it down to the market.  Extremely difficult to police that, because if the farmer’s already growing tomatoes and he’s buying tomatoes because he doesn’t have enough, that’s pretty hard [to pin down the origin]. He may sell not only at Greenmarkets, but also elsewhere in his own community at the farm stand or in other farmers’ markets, there’s no way of knowing whether he is selling more than he produces except within our own market.  We could see that.\nSo the bookkeeping is really difficult.  They submit crop plans. Every farmer has to submit an application at the beginning of the year.  It’s a very lengthy application.  The crop plan will show how many acres or even row-feet of each item he plans to bring in.  So at least we make sure there’s a match between what he’s growing and what we see in the table, and that’s followed up by a farm inspection, which still happens today.\n\nQ:  By whom?\n\nBenepe:  By a staff person on Greenmarket’s staff, Counsel on the Environment staff.  It’s a woman named June Russell who does it today, and she has some assistants.  She goes to the farms.  Policing is a big part of it.  So there’ll be the crop plan, the visit to the farm, and then the checking to see.\nWe do inventories at the market.  The [market] manager writes down everything’s being sold and the prices they’re being sold for.  So we can, one, track how well the market’s performing.  We try to—this is the hardest thing to gather, but we gather how much is being sold in addition to the price.  Farmers don’t like to say how much they’re making because they think the IRS somehow will find out, which is ridiculous.  The IRS can’t get anything from us.  They probably are more afraid of what their competition may know.  I’m not sure.  But we can always look at the empty crates piling up.  You can make some pretty good estimates.  I’ll ask them, “How did you do today?”  Some I know will keep their figures small, and some will be open about it.\nOne farmer from the Finger Lakes who would drive down the full distance—and this was going back, again, to the early eighties—would say, “I need to gross 1,600 to make it worth coming down.”  This was a market where I thought if people were making 300 they were doing well.  So 1,600 is a big figure.\n\nQ:  Let me go back for a second to Fifty-Ninth Street.  How long did that last?\n\nBenepe:  Not very long.  I think possibly three years at the most.  What happened was that the city owned the site, wanted to turn it over to a private developer, which they did pretty quickly.  We made a drawing, a really wonderful watercolor drawing, saying this could be a permanent park market, a great open space, right across from the bridge entrance, and tried to sell them on that idea, but the Community Board wasn’t very supportive for the market there, which is really strange.  The chair, I think, of the board then was Joanne Battalia, who was also, strangely enough, a member of the board of the Parks Council, was interested in parks.\n\nQ:  She was or you were?\n\nBenepe:  No, she was.  But she opposed the market.  She thought it was too commercial or something, didn’t look nice on the street.  She went to the Hamptons in the summer, so it didn’t matter to her, but when she was back from the Hamptons, she wanted to see the market disappear. \nThen there was a woman named Doyle.  What was Mrs. Doyle’s first name?  She was the Fifty-Ninth Street Association and she would go and take pictures of empty crates, which is, for me, of course, a symbol of success, but for her it was a symbol of failure, because they looked ugly, and take them to the Community Board and say, “Look at this, how bad it looks on our street, these empty crates inside the lot.”  So there was a certain kind of institutional resistance to the market from that part of the community that felt they represented the community.\n\nQ:  When did Union Square become the primary deal market?\n\nBenepe:  Very early.  First, it was slow starting, Union Square, and as I said, it was the city Planning Department which pushed it.  Mithoo Baxter’s boss, the commissioner then, was [Victor Marrero]….As a planning commissioner, he was very supportive as well.  The planning commissioner was supportive.  They managed to help—I don’t know if it’s support, but help the Highway Department and the Traffic Department in giving up the [parking] meter income [on Saturdays] because they were getting income from meters, so they didn’t want to lose that.  They didn’t make us pay up for the lost income.\nThat was a struggle, because Union Square was really undesirable in those years.  It was a drug haven.  There were actual shootings.  There were some murders involved.  The farmers working the market hated looking at it, such an awful environment.  I went over there once with Mary Frank and we were walking into the southern end of Union Square—this was during those late seventies—and one of the, I guess, dealers came up to us and said, “You don’t want to come into this park.  It’s not safe.”  [laughs]  That’s what the park was like then and why the city was desperate to turn it around and thought that we would help play a role.  Very few people came to the market in those early years.  It was not nearly as successful as Fifty-Ninth Street.  But the farmers were determined and they kept coming back.\nOf course, we would flyer like hell, just go out there and put out flyers on the streets and contact people.  The Community Board, we were actually at the focus of three Community Boards, two, four, and five.  Two was Greenwich Village, four was the Lower East Side, but five encompassed Union Square and that was a Midtown Board.  Actually, I had been on Community Board Five and their Traffic Committee, so I had contacts there.  Community Board Five is really quite strongly supportive.  They came down to the market to see how it was working, and were impressed that we live up to our commitment to how we ran the market and that there were farmers there; it wasn’t just peddlers.  So Community Board Five, for all those years, was supportive, unlike [some other] Community Boards [such as 6 and 7].\nCommunity Board One was always supportive of the markets downtown.  The Brooklyn Community board, I think remained supportive.  The Upper West Side, Community Board Seven, was supportive of that market up there, but not of other markets.  We had a market on [Verdi Square] next to … a subway station.  It has been rebuilt.  It’s now a park [with no room for a market].  We were doing very well there and they sort of pushed us out in order to get the subway station rebuilt and made into a park.  It’s a very nice park.\n\nQ:  The Seventy-Second Street Station.\n\nBenepe:  It’s Seventy-Second Street, maybe it is, yes.  But it was a very successful market.  We hated to lose it.\n\nQ:  There is still a small market there. \n\nBenepe:  At Seventy-Second or Seventy—\n\nQ:  Well, just below it.\n\nBenepe:  Sixty-Sixth, there’s one at Tucker Square.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBenepe:  My niece’s son is now working there, which I’m very pleased with.  He brings in a unique experience.  He got hired as a manager for that market and other West Side markets.  His experience is unique because he works as a farmer in Costa Rica during the winter.  On top of that, he speaks Spanish like a native, so in a lot of these communities, speaking Spanish is a great asset.  His name is Christopher, Christopher Wayne.  He is delighted with working in the market.  It’s nice to have this sort of family bridge going across and getting involved.\n\nQ:  So about five years after you started at Second Avenue, how many markets were there?\n\nBenepe:  During the 80s we grew to over 20 sites, but we closed as many markets as we opened because they were in bad locations.  Some of those were in the Bronx, some on the Upper West Side, so that we learned from experience what markets lasted.\nWe had one on Alexander Avenue in the Bronx and it had only one farmer, but as long as that one farmer was willing to go, we were happy to keep it open.  His name was Frank Cole.  Frank was an interesting guy from two respects.  One is, his farm was an area of New Jersey you never think of as farm country.  It was in the northwest, not in the south.  I’d never been over there before.  It was a very beautiful area.  The second unique thing about him was he had a boyfriend here in New York who worked for him, a black man, so he was very comfortable working in minority communities.  So he would go into an area where nobody else would go.  He was one of the two farmers who, when we had—this is another market we opened and closed—indoors [on Sundays] at the World Trade Center, where the escalators came up from the PATH tubes into that great hallway, we had that as a Sunday market, Frank, and then we had one farmer from New Jersey and one from New York. … So we had [a] farmer there representing [each] state.  We’d put up exhibits for them and talk about the state agriculture.  So we did some education about farming at the World Trade Center and make a connection, “This is why we’re in the World Trade Center.”\nSo Frank stayed with that market for a few years.  Port Authority was cooperative.  It was a very difficult market because they had to come in through the cellar, unload things, get into elevators, bring up their tables and chairs.\n\nQ:  The Port Authority one?\n\nBenepe:  Yes.  But they supported us and it worked for a while.  Then after 9/11, we opened up—oh, and then of course, at a certain point we moved up on the street in front of the World Trade Center.  That was an extraordinarily successful market even though it was in a business community, not a residential community.  One, we were in walking distances of a residential community on the Hudson River and the business community was so large the people come down at lunchtime and get things and take things back to New Jersey from New York.  [laughs]  New Jersey-grown produce.\n\nQ:  That’s pretty funny.  When and how did the concept of different days for different places emerge?\n\nBenepe:  That was sort of hit and miss.  Obviously, the World Trade Center you’d want a weekday, because that’s when the business community is open.  Which days we were able or not, Wednesdays we were pretty full so we needed to find outlets [on] other days when we didn’t have farmers and also our own staffing because from the standpoint of our program staffing, I hired people to work basically by the hour, not by the year.  They worked for me, not for the Council on the Environment.  So I would bill the Council on the Environment as a consultant.  So we didn’t have overhead to speak of.  We didn’t have any medical insurance, we didn’t have any holidays, because they were working [as contractors] like salesmen.  They were working by the hour and by the days we needed them.  It’s like how people work in restaurants in a certain way.  But on the other hand, I wanted to keep them as fully employed as possible for two reasons.  One, they needed the work, and, two, they were getting training which would be valuable.  When you learn how work on one site, you can work on the next.  And they got to know the farmers.  The farmers would see the same manager as we work from site to site.  I wanted to be consistent with good staff, trained staff, and committed staff.\nThen seasonality changed.  This was most apparent at Union Square.  Initially, as I said, we only opened during the summer and early fall.  That’s because you didn’t have crops growing the rest of the time.  But then gradually other crop products came in.  A very obvious one was bakers.  Well, bakers were not seasonal.  Then there were the crops like jams, honey, grains, and as more and more of those things came in and the range of food broadened, then we took the big step of bringing in meat, and there we were concerned all about the health laws.  But since we were under this New York Department of Agriculture, we operated under their laws, not the New York City Department of Health.  So they established those conditions which had to be met for farmers to bring in meat.  It had to come from approved slaughterhouses, USDA Approved.  So that was getting over a big hump, meat, then fish.\n\nQ:  When was that meat and fish?\n\nBenepe:  Well, everything really happened in the eighties because, after all, we started in ’76.  The late seventies was chiefly devoted to the opening of new markets, not so much of new products.  Union Square started as a Saturday market.  We felt there was enough demand there to then add Wednesday.  Then within about five years we added a Friday because Friday is close to the weekend.  Then when we decided to add a fourth day, we said we keep having the same people coming back who are selling on Saturdays coming back the Wednesday.  We see the same faces.  Union Square is too sought-after.  All the farmers sending applications always put Union Square at the top of their list.  We had no room for them.  So when we opened Monday, we said only new farmers for Monday; none of the old farmers already here can come.  That did two things, not only brought new faces, but it brought in a lot of organic farmers because the organic farmers came recently and that was ideal to give organic farmers a break into a strong market.\n\nQ:  How long was Bob with you?\n\nBenepe:  From the very beginning.\n\nQ:  But how long did he stay with you?\n\nBenepe:  That’s a good question.  When did he go to go work for the Department of Ag and Markets? [In the mid 80s].\n\nQ:  When you talked about the meat and fish, I wondered if he was already working for the state at that point.\n\nBenepe:  I don’t think so.  I would think he went to the state in about ’87 or ’88, but I’m not sure.  If you’re talking to him, he’ll tell you.  I could be way off.  That question of was he there when we had to go to the state or not, he would have probably played a more helpful and useful role after he was with the state than before, because I don’t think he had any particularly strong state connections before that.  That’s true.  One of the big things I’m sort of leaving out is the cast of characters one deals with on the agency level.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we talk about that.\n\nBenepe:  I’d put most strength on the people on the community boards, the chairs of community boards, the chairs of committees, the community organizations.  I mentioned already, in Brooklyn, the Brooklyn Heights Association, the … Washington Heights Association.  There were the Union Square Community Coalition …and they were very big supporters.  Evelyn Strauss succeeded Carl Rosenberg as the head of USCC.  Initially it was called the USPCC, it was Union Square Park Community Coalition, and “Park” got dropped out of their name.  Jack Taylor has been with them since the beginning.  He’s one of the people who give you consistency in their help.  So they were one typical of the local groups which were always in our support.\n\tWhen we first opened, a newspaper called The Packer, and it was the second newspaper representing the wholesale food industry, ran headline stories opposing us and trying to convince the city not to give us permits because they thought that we were competing with their grocery stores, and within weeks of those first editions of the papers, they turned around and supported us because they realized we weren’t competing with them and that we were a real farmers’ market.  They said, “We couldn’t care less about farmers.”  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Amazing.\n\nBenepe:  “They’re no threat.”  They thought we were brining California produce, that’s what they were worried about, and competing directly with Texas onions or [Florida] oranges.  I said, “New York?  New Jersey.”\nIn fact, we tried to convince them to carry local produce.  Fairway has done that to quite an extent.  I’ve forgotten the one on the East Side said they were going to carry local.  They put it in their advertising.  It was either Shoprite or something like that.  They would say “local” in their advertising, and I would go to the store to see if they were really carrying local and they weren’t.  It was phony advertising.  And I would talk to them about it.  I’d say, “Where’s your local stuff?”  Because I wanted the competition.  I wanted to see them buying local food.  My thought was if the supermarkets would carry all the regional produce that could be grown here, there’s no need for us.  I’d be happy if I was put out of existence by good, honest competition, but they weren’t moving in that direction.\nI did a survey and I got a grant for it [to determine the market for locally grown].  I never completed it to the publishable state. ….  But the core of the survey was to pick thirteen locally grown items that are also sold at Hunts Point and to see what percentage of these thirteen fruits and vegetables sold at Hunts Point came from local sources.  One of them, eggplant, almost completely, 100 percent, came from local, regional sources, strangely enough.  Eggplant being the only one.  But in general, the others had a very small percentage, as low as 2 or 3, 4 percent from the region.  Carrots were coming from Canada, from California.  California carrots were delicious and cheap.  I can understand why.  Even local apples were hard to find in the stores.  They were coming from the State of Washington.  That was a big supply.\nSo that what the study showed is that food was not being purchased locally.  People speak about the watershed.  We were talking about the foodshed and we developed a big three-dimensional map showing where the farms were in our region.  We had little pins we put on the map to show the cluster of farms.  That concept of foodshed has been adopted, I think, by the [Barack] Obama administration.  I think they used the term “foodshed” this past year.  I think maybe Michelle Obama talked about it a bit. [Also, our Manhattan Borough President, Scott Stringer, announced a new initiative, “Food in the Public Interest,” released in February 2009.]\n\nQ:  Has anybody ever agreed on the distance?\n\nBenepe:  Michelle Obama was quoted as using a very great distance, and Stringer, 200 miles….\n\nQ:  He had a conference.\n\nBenepe:  Stringer.  Scott Stringer.  He … gave a news conference [at Union Square announcing an upcoming conference late in the year.]  If you could extend the subject and were going to talk to him, that’s a great report.  He talked about how we were moving quite far, at least, I think he says 200 miles.  We normally see it as being 120 miles.  When we’d said 250 miles, we realized we were moving down into Delaware.  We actually had a Delaware farmer—I think I might have mentioned this to you during our last interview—who came up with a small school bus loaded with melons from Delaware and his barefoot daughter.  It was wonderful.  In a gingham dress, the whole works.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  How much of your time was all this taking up?\n\nBenepe:  Literally all of it and more.  I was doing some other consulting work, but I didn’t have time for very much.\n\nQ:  This was over from the beginning until when?\n\nBenepe:  Let me take that back.  Maybe in terms of my available time it might have been as little as 40 percent, the big part of it, but it gradually grew to be close to 100 percent by the time I retired.  I mean, I did want to keep my foot in the door in planning projects.  I did a lot of work during the eighties in communities like Woodstock.\n\nQ:  You mean pro bono work.\n\nBenepe:  Not pro bono, no.\n\nQ:  Actual billable work?\n\nBenepe:  Yes, professional work.  Historic preservation was an area which I was very active in.  I did a preservation guide for East Hampton Village in New York.  I [prepared] a country report for Ulster County and that’s still being [sold in bookstores].  That was in the seventies.  I did master planning for communities in Sullivan County and Ulster County.\n\nQ:  When did Union Square get to that imagibility level?\n\nBenepe:  In 1987 the Parks Department [prepared plans]… to rebuild Union Square Park itself, and his model for the park was going to be Bryant Park.  I don’t know if you remember the plan for Union Square.  It’s a Union Jack plan.  First of all, you should step back further.  The 1811 plan for Union Square [later added] Union Square Park, I think, was built itself around 1826, was an oval park, complete oval, like an egg, with a green in the middle [designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, I think]…..\nThen at sometime in the 1930s, maybe ’34, they connected the subways there, the IRT and the BMT.  In order to do this, they wanted to create a mezzanine over the subway tracks which ran under the park at an angle, so they had to raise the entire park to cover the mezzanine by about four feet.  As a consequence, the park was no longer level with the ground, and they developed this formal plan with its paths intersecting like the Union Jack flag at the center with a huge flagpole and a space at the center.  As a consequence, the park became really an uninteresting spot.  I don’t know who designed it.\n\nQ:  Uninteresting?\n\nBenepe:  Yes.  I wouldn’t be surprised that its eventual demise in the 1970s as a drug haven was partly related to its poor design.  It was a park nobody really wanted to go to.  It was a park where it was always associated with—well, during the depression years—this was when it was rebuilt—it was a hangout for winos and public speakers.\n\nQ:  [laughs]  Perhaps one and the same at various times.\n\nBenepe:  Jack Taylor loves to recount the history of the north end being used for public speaking.  He incorrectly, despite that, the illustrations he sends out say the pavilion was a speakers’ rostrum, but the pavilion was seldom if ever the speakers’ rostrum.  If you see the photographs and drawings of that day, the speaker’s always out in the square in the north on his own rostrum where he can be seen and heard and the pavilion was being used by the police to keep an eye on people.\n\nQ:  Let me just take you back to that subway mezzanine.\n\nBenepe:  Construction, yeah.\n\nQ:  So presumably that was called Union Square.  The stop was called Union Square.\n\nBenepe:  Yes, it was.  It was called Union Square-Fourteenth Street.  That was synonymous, sort of like saying Herald Square-Thirty-Fourth Street, Times Square-Forty-Second Street.  Those words kind of run together.\n\tSo that was known as Union Square.  It was Union Place at its very beginning in 1811 because it was the intersection of two roads, Bloomingdale Road and the Albany Post Road, and where they came together was their union.  It had nothing to do with labor unions, nothing to do with what are some of the other theories behind it, but it was the union of two streets.  It didn’t have anything to do with the victory of the Civil War going to the Union, either.  Some people thought it had to do with the Civil War.\nThe cortege, Lincoln’s cortege came down Broadway and wound around the north end.  The parade route was always down along the north end and down.  That’s why there has such contemporary meaning to the new [proposed] traffic plans for Union Square, which have not come to bear, which I hoped would, that Broadway would go across the north end and down the east side and not down the west side, which it still splits and goes around it and produces a bad traffic situation.\nSo the fact that Union Square was raised, put over the mezzanine, the double whammy both of destroying the park in order to build the mezzanine, maybe a triple whammy, then raising it off the ground so it became less accessible, less inviting, and then blocking off the north end with this ugly pavilion so you couldn’t get in anymore from the north because the Tennis Pavilion, which was on the ground level, a shingle-design structure, it was called a Ladies Pavilion, I think, and that was a wooden building and there was very generous pathways going around both ends of it and walking into the square.  All of that was destroyed with this bringing it up.\nSo you had the closure of the north end access.…Then you had this crazy pathway system of treating the park as a traffic artery for people to walk through the square and not go into a park.  It wasn’t really a park. …So that when Bronson Binger-- I think he was Manhattan Parks Commissioner.  If not, he was the chief designer of the new park -- came to the community [he] asked for our input with his design.  Generally we were supportive at USCC of the design of creating a [central] green lawn, but suggested he reflect the oval of Union Square in the path system and not replicate the rectangular pathway system of Bryant Park, which is what he did.  So he liked that suggestion and created curved paths that celebrated the holding of the park, the oval form, and that makes a big difference in how you experience the park, gets away from straight lines.\nThen in recent years, the park’s [unclear] in one year, it’s made one improvement after another.  They brought in the landscape designer who did Bryant Park.  She’s famous.\n\nQ:  I don’t know.\n\nBenepe:  Anyway, she was brought in to do additional landscaping a few years ago.  What’s now called the Partnership, it used to be called the BID, they’ve been very supportive of design improvements.  Henry Stern got in back of funding it and improving it, and Bronson was working for him as Parks Commissioner.  So there’s a lot of attention from ’87 forward.\n\nQ:  So the seventies were—\n\nBenepe:  Depression years.\n\nQ:  The eighties, say the beginning of the eighties, how big was the farmers’ market and on what days?\n\nBenepe:  We were chiefly on the north end.  We didn’t even come down the side for years.  We weren’t even full on the north end except on Saturdays.  Wednesday, which is the second busiest day.  Friday was a very slow day.  By the time we opened on Mondays, which would have been the eighties, and by that time the park maybe even had been redesigned, but I’m not sure, it might have been mid-eighties, we were so well established, people knew we were there, but it took at least three years for Union Square to be established as a destination.\n\nQ:  At least three years from when?\n\nBenepe:  From ’77 to ’80.\n\nQ:  When did the west end begin to be used?\n\nBenepe:  I’d say early, mid-eighties.  We only came down two-thirds the way.  It was kind of narrow in there.  It was rather difficult.  We had to deal with two subway entrances.  Entrances to the park itself had to be kept open.  We had to deal with a lot of traffic conflicts, people coming down Union Square West, cars, taxis, and trucks, so it was really crowded.  The intersection of Seventeenth Street and Broadway was always difficult and is still difficult.  So we had to overcome those difficulties.  In a sense, the fact that there was always that traffic there made us more accessible.  Obviously people walking to and from the subway system saw us.  So we were seen by a lot of people.\nThen, of course, the southern end became an attraction for the peddlers.  So up until this reconstruction—what I call the peddlers are the people with dry goods and who apparently are winning their case in court.  It all revolved around the rights to free expression, I guess.  So the courts have interpreted putting out a newspaper broadside to putting out t-shirts, it’s all in the same family.\n\nQ:  I guess what I’m trying to get at is at what point did that—let’s put it this way—\n\nBenepe:  It grew slowly.  There wasn’t any one point.\n\nQ:  It grew slowly, but especially for people who don’t live here, when you say the Greenmarket, people think Union Square.  When did that happen?\n\nBenepe:  When did they originally know it was Union Square or think of Union Square?\n\nQ:  Well, when did it become the concept of Greenmarket—\n\nBenepe:  Was identified with Union Square?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nBenepe:  Very early, because there was no other place that seized—there were two things going on at the same time.  One was location and the other was the service mark, the main Greenmarket, which became synonymous with farmers’ market.  So that we could go to a community and say, “We want to open a Greenmarket here,” and even our attorneys were confused.\n“Well, what is Greenmarket?  Is it a program, is it a location, or is it a type of market?”  It was all three of those, really.  Greenmarket was the location, it was a type of market, and it was the service mark name of a program.  Technically it was only the latter, the last, the service mark of a program.\n\nQ:  A service market?\n\nBenepe:  A service mark.  It was a trademark, in other words, a federally registered service mark.  It could not be used by anybody else.\n\nQ:  When did that happen?\n\nBenepe:  That was early eighties.  There was a group down in the South that started and they publicized themselves as Greenmarket.  We had to write them a letter saying, “You can’t do this.”  I don’t know if we still do it or not, occasionally you will see somebody coming out saying they just opened a greenmarket with a small g.  I don’t know if the council still sends out letters or not and whether they’ve reestablished their service mark or not, as they have to do every seven years.  It was important because too often people would put in a phony farmers’ market and then, on top of that, call it a Greenmarket.  It’s bad enough to call it a farmers’ market.  So that’s why it was important to have the service mark, that you would be guaranteed that you were buying from farmers, truly grown in farms.  And that’s why it was important to protect the service mark.  We weren’t trying to keep a monopoly; we were trying to keep an ideal alive.\n\nQ:  Over time did your job change?  What were you called, actually?\n\nBenepe:  I was called the Director of Greenmarket.  No, it really didn’t change.  I was inventive.  I was moving in different directions, like I mentioned, the big [relief] map we did of the region, different events, talking to different people.  Conferences were an important way of reaching out.  I didn’t try in any way to get grants or to be active on the national level in any way.\nWe did advise other communities.  One of our funders was New Jersey-based.  They were not in Morristown, but near Morristown [in Madison]…. They wanted to establish farmers’ markets in New Jersey.  We helped start them but we didn’t want to  run markets in New Jersey.  Another funder which had a lot of money wanted us to establish farmers’ markets in Long Island, and we did, but we wanted other people to run them; we didn’t want to run them.  So we’d give birth to new markets run by other people.\n\nQ:  About how many?\n\nBenepe:  Well, then I didn’t keep track to see if they were still running, but all told, the number of markets we may have given birth to would be six, maybe more.  We helped start a market in White Plains, another one in Scarsdale.  What we’d do is meet with the local group there and advise them how to start a market, how to stock it, and so forth, and say, “Now you’re on your own.”  So we weren’t interested in extending Greenmarket as a program, but extending the idea of farmers’ markets in the region, run by other people.  We did this seriously when we had a grant for that purpose, as we did in Long Island and New Jersey.  The ones in White Plains and Scarsdale were probably the results of somebody asking us.  We just made a brief—I’m not even sure we charged for it.  So I didn’t attempt to get involved under a Kellogg Grant, for example, doing something nationally.  I didn’t personally have those kinds of ambitions at the time.  That’s where Gus [Schumacher] is working, on the national level.\n\nQ:  How did the staff grow, the office staff?\n\nBenepe:  That’s a good question.  Tony Manetta was important.  He became my assistant director and he probably came to me.  Joe Patraker came to him and they formed kind of a bond.  Other staff people, I had Mike Zimsky… is a great staff person.  I hated to lose him.  You meet people maybe in the market sometimes.  They weren’t personal introductions.  I think they tended to be more meeting in the field, a conference or friends of friends.  Somebody knows somebody, somebody good, they work for us.\n\nQ:  As something like a market manager or what?\n\nBenepe:  Both market manager and in the office.  I needed good people in the office too.  One of the programs that started while I was still there was called the New Farmer Program.  We had a special grant for that too.\n\nQ:  Immigrant farmers?\n\nBenepe:  Well, it moved into that, but it wasn’t meant to be, but because of the staff working on it, who were Hispanic-speaking, they tended to reach out more to Hispanic-speaking potential farmers, but that bias wasn’t built into the program.  It was also to reach out to any small farmer who wanted to get started and help them get their feet on the ground.\nOne of the women who’s worked hardest in that program is Laurel Halter. She’s still with the council and she’d be good background on that program.  There are others who have been working on it too.  I can’t recall really where.\n\nQ:  I’m a little bit confused.  Do some of these people work for the Council on the Environment?\n\nBenepe:  [They do now.] [Before] they worked for me.  What happened was at a certain point the council wanted to adopt the programming and bring the program under the council and put everybody on their payroll.  That was getting close to the time I wanted to retire anyway.  I never became a member of their staff, but I just transferred my staff over to the council, and the location of the office moved from my location at Sixteenth Street down to the Council on the Environment at 51 Chamber Street.  That all happened in 1998.\n\nQ:  When you retired.\n\nBenepe:  Yes.  That had some major benefits.  Well, first of all, now most of our people are working full-time because….. two-thirds of the markets were running year-round.  One-third closed at the close of the season.  We’re doing this now in Saugerties.  Judith and I came up there.  We found that our market could run through the winter once we moved indoors, and was more successful in the winter than it was in the summer in terms of the number of people it attracted, which was interesting.  We had one farmer stay throughout the whole winter who has root crops, potatoes and carrots and radishes and turnips and things like that.  Then one farmer had been trying to get there for a long time for our summer market, Bernadette Bulich, who does dried flowers, she came into our winter market for the first time.  She lives within twenty miles’ distance from the market.  She didn’t do all as well as I would have liked her to have done.  She was not one of the more popular farmers.\nBut our apple grower stayed with us all winter because they have a lot of apples out of storage.  The meat person, of course, and the cheesers, and some maple syrup, some organic food products.  Somebody, Cathy Kreda … does a lot of jarred and bottled products, some really interesting stuff.  She does dried garlic chips.  They’re wonderful.  You could eat them just like nuts, but they’re powerful.\n\nQ:  What about the rules for the participating farmers?  How did they get established?\n\nBenepe:  They became more and more stringent.  So participating farmers can bring in only what they grow, unless they were given permission to bring in specific items from specific farms within twenty-five miles, which we don’t already have in the market.  For example, a typical item would be eggs.  You have a small market with five farmers, nobody has eggs.  Honey might be another, things like that.\n\nQ:  Tell me, though, people now have to pay for insurance, don’t they?\n\nBenepe:  Yes, farmers do.\n\nQ:  The farmers must secure their own.  What kind of insurance?\n\nBenepe:  Not only their health, Department of Agriculture health regulations, but the insurance is a sticky requirement, so a lot of insurance coverage liability.  It’s a pain in the neck and it really discourages small farmers--there are so many [state regulations]-- people that would participate in markets, except the regulations that are imposed. It happens with us in Saugerties.\n\nQ:  What other kinds of regulations?\n\nBenepe:  One of the ones we’re running afoul of now, a very popular thing to have in markets is prepared foods.  People cook things in their kitchens, some great dishes, and bring them in.  They can’t do it.  They have to be inspected kitchens.  They have to have licensed handling, rubber gloves, the washing at the market, the toilets, the whole works.\n\nQ:  Kind of standard city health regulations.\n\nBenepe:  Well, yes, and up there it’s county health regulations.  So it cramps the freshness and vitality of the market.  I’ve just been reading about this now with another program in the papers recently. It’s the yogurt people in the papers recently.  The state regulations on the practice of yogurt, it’s putting a lot of small people out of business.  They have to come out now with big insurance.  It’s enriching insurance companies every time they come up with regulations.\n\nQ:  When you retired, how did you see your future?\n\nBenepe:  [laughs] It was a great release.  I could do what I wanted to do anytime I wanted to do it.  The downside of running Greenmarket is I had to be there to run it.  So I saw my future as being relieved of responsibilities other than those I chose to be responsible for.  So it was a great freedom.  It’s like going out to play.  Recess.\n\nQ:  You had bought the Saugerties property how long before that?\n\nBenepe:  1983.\n\nQ:  A long time.\n\nBenepe:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So did you see yourself primarily living there or what?\n\nBenepe:  I’ve never been able to make that determination.  If push came to shove and I had to live in one of the two places, it’d probably be here because my roots are in New York and I was born here.  New York’s my true parent, the bricks, the pavement.  I mean, the changes in New York are very rapid.  They can be disorienting, but they also can be very stimulating, the High Line being one of them.\nI discovered a new cross-block arcade today I didn’t know existed between Seventh and Sixth Avenue.  It was so attractive, I walked too far south, I had to turn back uptown.  I went from Fifty-Fourth to Fifty-First Street.\n\nQ:  So primarily, or not primarily, what have you been doing?\n\nBenepe:  In Saugerties, I’m Chair of the Historic Preservation Commission.  We have a lot on our plate out there.  We just organized a major stone house tour.  A team of four or five of us worked on it with one woman chiefly in charge, who would be up until all hours of the morning.  It was an extremely successful tour.  It brought a lot of public attention and love of Saugerties’ stone houses.  There were only eight houses in the tour, but we made clear there were sixty-eight in the community. \nThe next thing on our plate is one of our members is putting together a proposal for doing a major book on Saugerties’ town and village.  I’m a member of the Comprehensive Planning Committee and trying to do a major rewriting of the zoning law.  We’ve been working on it for years.\n\nQ:  The planning committee for?\n\nBenepe:  For Saugerties.\n\nQ:  And trying to rewrite the zooming law.\n\nBenepe:  Yes.\n\nQ:  To what end?\n\nBenepe:  Protect open space is one of the major things, protect the environment, and get better-designed projects.  It’s a difficult battle because you’re basically dealing with the old school and sort of “We’ve always done things this way.  Don’t interfere with us.  I have the right to do what I want with my own land,” which they’ve stretched to, “I have the right to do what I want with other people’s land too.”  So it’s a leveling procedure trying to protect.  It’s my personal love as well.  Really, I’m working in that community, I want to protect it.\n\nQ:  Do you farm at all on the property?\n\nBenepe:  Yes, I have a garden.  It’s not terribly successful.  I’m not scientific at all.\n\nQ:  I assume it’s, but you tell me, smaller than the Maryland farm that you—\n\nBenepe:  It’s about the size, twice the size of this apartment.\n\nQ:  What do you grow?\n\nBenepe:  Right now I’m growing onions and Swiss chard, tomatoes and potatoes and string beans, which are not doing very well, and—\n\nQ:  For your own use?\n\nBenepe:  That’s right.  I don’t sell anything.  [I give surplus to the local food pantry.] We still buy a lot of produce in the market, which is why I don’t work so hard with growing it, since we can get it at the market.\n\nQ:  Listen, before I let you go, I would appreciate it if you’d, as briefly as you’d like, comment on you and Adrian and Washington Square Park and what that was all about and how you feel about it now.\n\nBenepe:  Well, two different parks, Washington Square and Union Square.  Washington Square, I’ve always been supportive of what the Parks Department is doing.  I’ve been fighting people in the community a bit on that, because they’re the ones who are fighting change in Washington Square.  I think the proof of the pudding is Washington Square every month is getting better.  It’s absolutely beautiful.\n\nQ:  It is.\n\nBenepe:  Moving the fountain was important.  The strange thing is that I’ve discovered, and I have to talk with George Velonakle about this, but while the fountain is on axis with the arch, the arch is not strictly on axis with the avenue.  So that’s a kind of strange thing.  But now people don’t ever notice it.  Also I wanted to see more trees planted around the center circle, which hasn’t happened yet, I think will happen.  I’ve been very supportive of the Parks Department on that altogether.\n\tUnion Square is where I agree with USCC.  I had to resign from the USCC board because of the fight over the pavilion and turning it into a restaurant.  USCC chose as their attorney Al Butzel, and Al Butzel said, “Oh, this is going to be good.  Benepe versus Benepe.”  So I said… that’s when I resigned [from USCC].  I didn’t want to create that kind of a picture and I was getting that from the writers on the newspaper.\n\nQ:  You mean that’s when you resigned from the USCC?\n\nBenepe:  From USCC, yes.\n\nQ:  Was there ever any kind of antagonism about what was planned between you and your son?\n\nBenepe:  No, just disappointment in the sense that, I mean, he, first of all, the earlier DOT Commission was not supportive of doing something.  Adrian came to me and he said, “What do you think if we made Seventeenth Street one-way [east] at the north end?”\n\tI said, “I think it’s going to create traffic problems through the intersections.”  Then when I looked at it, I saw it created traffic opportunities.  I said, “It’s a pretty good idea.”  But then the then director of the [Union Square] Bid Partnership was pushing this too, and they both, the directors left and they backed away from the commitment.  So we didn’t get the expanded square and we didn’t get the improved traffic arrangements.  The [$12 million] money they’re spending on that is atrocious on what’s being done for nothing. \nThey’re building new bathrooms because they’re giving up the existing bathroom for the restaurant use.  The restaurant, even then, whether it will really happen or not I don’t know, because, see, even the Community Board has come out opposed to the restaurant.  There are some fixtures in the works for a long time, but I’ve never known the bottom of it.  Why are we insisting?  Because they have a pavilion exactly like it in Chinatown at Columbus Park.  It’s not a restaurant.  It’s a nice community building.  It’s identical situation.  It’s at the north end of the park and frames the entrance to the park and everything.  So I don’t know [why it can’t happen at Union Square].\nMillions are being spent to make the restaurant possible that have nothing to do with the pavilion itself.  The restaurant will never pay for that, those millions invested.  Even thought they say 5 million is an anonymous donation, which I just don’t understand.  Who, anonymously, is giving 5 million dollars to that restaurant?  Somebody who’s writing about it should ask.  It can’t be anonymous for 5 million dollars.\n\nQ:  Is this something that you and your son talk about?\n\nBenepe:  No, he doesn’t really want to talk about Parks issues much.  Through him, with his help, I talked to Janette Sadik-Kahn about Union Square.  I have to go back to talk to her some more about Union Square West.  One thing I’m trying to achieve is reversing the traffic direction in Union Square West.  That would relieve the problem at Seventeenth Street, totally.\nThen the next thing would be to improve the design.  Janette has the right ideas in some places, but they’re not carried out the right way.  I pointed this out in a letter to the Times that [may be] printed this week.  With Madison Square, the concept there was mine, was advanced to DOT and they accepted it.  To reroute Broadway from intersecting Fifth Avenue at Twenty-Third Street to entering the park at Twenty-Fourth Street and going through a corner and making the park a true rectangle or square.  They adopted that, but instead of taking that corner, which is a corner of the park, and making it a corner of the park with planted lawns, with a road going through the park, they made an expansion of the street and just made it a pedestrian area in the street.  So the traffic concept was carried through, but the design concept wasn’t.\n\nQ:  Well, you may have retired from the Greenmarket, but your commitment to the city is obviously still alive and well.\n\nBenepe:  I’m very supportive of Washington Square and what George Velonakis [has also done for City Hall Park and Abingdon Square--that’s his drawing up there on the wall, by the way.  I fought some people in my own community on that one, too.  Because I thought his design is a wonder.  His design of City Hall Park is great.  But my own colleague on the Fine Arts Federation thinks he’s too period an architect now and he doesn’t adopt modern design elements.  But I say to my colleagues, “Well, show me good modern design elements to adopt.”  Nobody’s come up with anything on fences or street furniture or lamps which comes close to the old stuff.\n\nQ:  All that said, it probably doesn’t at all surprise you to have Barry be in the Parks Commission.\n\nBenepe:  Adrian.\n\nQ:  Adrian, I’m sorry.  You’re Barry.\n\nBenepe:  No, I get confused, too.  I sometimes call him my father.  No, but it’s been consistent because he started with the Parks Department as a volunteer, I guess.  As an Urban Task Ranger.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBenepe - 2 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n","description":"In 1976, the post-World War II habits of supermarket shopping still ruled American kitchens.

TTT\nInterviewee:  Dalia Carmel\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #1\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\tManhattan, New York\nDate:  September 24, 2009\n\nQ:  It’s September 24, and I’m with Dalia Carmel at her apartment on the East Side of midtown Manhattan, right here at the United Nations, where there are a lot of people right now.\n\tGood afternoon.\n\nCarmel:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we start with your telling me where and when you were born and a little bit about your parents and your early life.\n\nCarmel:  I was born in Jerusalem, Palestine, on September 1, 1935.  I was born to a Latvian mother and a Hungarian father who immigrated to Israel as physicians, as TB specialists, in the early thirties.  They originally settled in Tztat, in the northern part of Israel, where there was a famous TB hospital where they both worked.  Then they moved to Jerusalem, where my father practiced, being a lung physician and TB specialist.\n\nQ:  Could you explain what it meant to be Palestine at that point?  What did the designation of Palestine refer to?\n\nCarmel:  In 1935, Israel was part of the British Empire and it was called Palestine at the time as, I think, a protectorate of the British rule.  That changed in 1948, with the declaration of independence, creating the State of Israel.  But my birth certificate says that I was born in Jerusalem, Palestine.  So basically, I’m a Palestinian, sort of.\nMy parents came from well-to-do-families.  My father studied medicine in Hungary and in Germany, and my mother, in Latvia and in Germany.  They met in Gerbersdorf, Germany, I guess as residents, and that was the beginning of their romance that brought them to Israel.\nMy father ran a hospital in Jerusalem for TB patients during the morning and early afternoon, and then in the late afternoon, he had a private practice at home, where my mother was his assistant with the patients at home.  Once I was born, she did not go to work.  She returned to work when I turned sixteen.  At that time, she did not go back to her specialty, but she returned to medicine and was working for the blood bank as a hematologist.\nShe was a terrific cook and a terrific baker.  In view of the fact my father was a Hungarian and a rather controlling Hungarian, like so many Hungarians are, so the cuisine was basically Hungarian, except on the days where he was ensconced in the hospital and on big laundry days, where the laundress used to come to the house.  At that time, my mother would make Russian food.\n\nQ:  Like what?\n\nCarmel:  Like cabbage soup, like borscht.  Those were the dishes that we had that would last a good two days and they were good.  When the laundress would come and stand there in the kitchen and scrub the sheets and the towels and then run up to the sixth floor, to the roof, to hang them.  It was a different life.\n\nQ:  What about the Hungarian food?  What was that like?\n\nCarmel:  Hungarian food was terrific.  My mother used to make a lot of goulash and pot roast and chicken paprikash and the most marvelous creamed leezo and Nockerl and palacsinta, and she used to make her own fruit jams.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nCarmel:  And she used to make homemade noodles that she would cook with mun, little poppy seeds.\n\nQ:  Mun, yes, poppy seeds.\n\nCarmel:   And she was a fabulous soup maker and a fabulous baker.  She made apple schnitten and linzer torta and cookies and challah.  Really, she was exceptionally good in the kitchen.  When I was young, I was extremely thin, almost as if I was deprived of food.\n\nQ:  But you were tall early?\n\nCarmel:  I was tall early.  I was thin.  I was tall, stretched out, and concave.  [laughter]  And in order to fight that, my father used to bring once a week, I think a gallon jar of fresh sour cream from the farm that was located near the hospital where he worked, and this was to fatten me up.\nThen my father also took care of a famous Arab Bey, who lived in Jericho.  He used to go once a week to Jericho to take care of him.  He would travel on the Sabbath and we would sometimes go with him and go and visit Bey Dayani.d  They would send with us back, I don’t know how you call it, a whole thing of bananas.\n\nQ:  A stalk, I guess.\n\nCarmel:  The whole thing.  So that I should eat the whole thing by the next week, so that I should be fattened up.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Not possible.\n\nCarmel:  Well, I guess it wound up being helpful, you know, to my fat cells, because you can see where I’m at.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  What size were your parents?\n\nCarmel:  They were normal.\n\nQ:  Were they tall?\n\nCarmel:  They were tall, but I think at some point my mother was slightly taller than my father, maybe because of small heels that she wore or maybe because he shrunk.  But I was taller than the two of them.  I have one photograph where I’m taller.  But they were already a little older.  Don’t forget that they were not young parents, by any means.\n\nQ:  They were older parents?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah, they were older parents, which is a situation I do not recommend.\n\nQ:  How old were they?\n\nCarmel:  You know something, I don’t know, but I think they were in their late thirties.  My father had no patience for children, for noise.  So we never went to the beach.  We never played.  Everything had to be quiet.  And he was Hungarian, so.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Right.\n\nQ:  Were your parents kosher?\n\nCarmel:  No, but my mother came from a very Orthodox family, none of whom I ever met, but I was told that they were Orthodox.  My father didn’t come from an Orthodox family, and we did not keep kosher.  But they sent me to a British school which was Orthodox, an Orthodox British school in Jerusalem.  They served us lunch, which was kosher.  We had to pray morning, noon.  I didn’t appreciate that one bit.  Especially as we kept kosher in school, and when I came home we had pork for lunch.  We would have lunch and I would ask, “What is this?”\n“Oh, this is chicken.”\nEvery day was chicken.  One day I said, “You know, yesterday was chicken, today is chicken.  Doesn’t look the same.”\nMy father said to my mother in German, thinking that I don’t understand, saying, “You know, she’s getting older and she’s realizing the difference in what we’re eating.”\nSo I told her, I said, “Tell me, so what is it?”\n“This was rabbit.”\nSo the combination of Orthodox in school and free at home with goulash with sour cream and—\n\nQ:  Why did they send you to this school?\n\nCarmel:  First of all, when I started elementary school, I started very early because I was very tall.  The kindergarten didn’t want me anymore; I was too tall.  Also I had—I don’t think that she was a nanny; I think she was a cook or something.  She taught me how to read Hebrew and English.  So I was bored in kindergarten.  So I went to school.  I was just about five years old, and I wasn’t socially ready for mixed company of boys and girls, so I was always having problems with the boys because my mother made me—you know, everything was so prissy, with bows and ribbons and “Don’t get dirty.”  So the British school was all girls, so it was safer, and in that school you learned manners, which you didn’t learn in the other schools, and manners were more important than information.\n[It] was so retarded, they kept the entire school an extra year.  They froze the school.  But being that I had left, I managed to go to the next grade, provided I took some tests, because, let me tell you, we did not learn anything besides to say “please” and “thank you.”\n\tOne of the things that I always laughed about was, when I went to the high school I was one semester late.  The War of Independence broke in the middle, so I missed the whole first semester, so I was now not only retarded information-wise, I missed a whole semester.  So the headmaster of the high school was willing to test me.  So we were in his office and he makes me look at a world map, and he says to me, “Show me where Germany is.”\n\t“I don’t know.”  In school we had the maps of England in every class, and England was from the floor to the ceiling.  It didn’t even show that it was a real island.  So where the hell is Germany?  I knew England.  I knew how many knives were made in Sheffield.  [laughter]  But what’s the relationship of this map to the world?  So I looked at the map and I remembered that my father, during the Second World War, was playing with pins and he was moving pins.  There was one area that I figured this must be Germany.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  One area where there were lots of pins?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.  So this is how the school—\n\nQ:  But were you right?\n\nCarmel:  I was right, yeah.  [laughter]  But the extent of lack of knowledge of information was so tremendous.  For instance, he asked me, “If somebody is very poor and has to take a loan, what does he pay back the bank?”\n\tSo I said, “This is such a stupid question.  If he doesn’t have any money, how can he pay back?”  [laughter]\n\tAnd he says to me, “Haven’t you heard of interest?”  There’s a word in Hebrew, ribit de ribit.\n\t“Never heard that.” \n\tSo he took me on.  He accepted me to go to school on condition that by the end of the year I will have to take the exams that other kids take at the end of the previous year.  But I finished the year with first prizes in mathematics, in French, in geography, in God knows what.  I came with all the prizes.  I knocked on the door.  I said, “So give me the date for the next test.”  [laughter]  So that’s how I moved from the British system to the Israeli system.\n\nQ:  Where was this school?\n\nCarmel:  In Ramat Gan.  We moved from Jerusalem to Ramat Gan in—what month was it?  At the end of the first armistice of the War of Independence, whenever that was.  We moved first to Jaffa, to a hospital by the beach, which was exactly what TB patients needed.  [laughs]  Then we found an apartment someplace in Ramat Gan.  I went to school in Ramat Gan and finished high school in Ramat Gan.  Then I was too young to go to the army, and my parents wouldn’t sign me off to go to the army with my class mates because I was too young.\n\nQ:  How old did you have to be, eighteen?\n\nCarmel:  Eighteen.  I was sixteen and a half.  So my father decided it will be a good idea if I go work in the Foreign Office.\n\nQ:  Hey, that’s a leap.  [laughs]\n\nCarmel:  He had a friend that ran the archives in the Foreign Office.  He spoke to him and they agreed to bring me in for an interview to the head of the personnel department.  [laughs]  The Personnel Manager says to me, “But Dalia, I can’t hire you.  You’re too young to be an employee and you’re too old to be a trainee.”\n\tSo I said, “What’s the age have to do with anything?”\n\tHe says to me, “How am I going to pay you?”\n\tI said, “Pay me? One only pays the cleaning ladies.”\n\nQ:  Why did you think that?\n\nCarmel:  I don’t know.  I didn’t think that anybody else was getting any money.\n\tSo he said, “You want to work for nothing?”\n\tI said, “I don’t know how to work.  Why would you pay me?  I don’t know to do anything.”\n\tSo he took me on and I worked there for about ten months, having a wonderful time.  I did whatever I wanted.  [laughter]  Whatever I wanted.  They assigned me to work with somebody.  I didn’t like him because he used to scratch his balls, then I’m not working for him.  No way.  So they assigned me to somebody else.  I said, “I don’t work for him because he always peeps under my skirt when I’m up on the ladder.  No way.”  [laughter]  It was good to be young.\n\tThen it was time to go to the army.  I joined the army on May 3, 1953.  I served in the army two years in compulsory service and a year and some in regular service.  In the army I was the secretary of the Chief of Intelligence.\n\nQ:  How did that happen?  Was that in part because you had had some work experience before?\n\nCarmel:  Number one, the fact that I had a little work experience.  Number two, because I spoke, read, and wrote both Hebrew and English, and I also spoke German and I read German, but I didn’t know German.  To this day I don’t know German.  I know how to read because I can read the Latin letters, but no other reason.  In high school I learned French and I was pretty good at it, so I could also dabble in French.  So that was something that they wanted. I also knew how to type both Hebrew and English.\n\tWe were three girls in training camp that wanted to go to the intelligence and they let us go.  One was a British girl, who was one of my best friends from the time that we boarded the truck that took us to training camp.  She was slightly older and looked totally foreign to the group of girls on this cow truck.  This was a truck without any seats or anything.  You carry cows to market with that.  We became very friendly.  She spoke some Hebrew and very good English and French and German and Italian and Spanish.  So she was grabbed to work in the army censorship.  She hated it.  She hated it.\n\nQ:  What was army censorship?  What were they censoring?\n\nCarmel:  To read all the soldiers’ letters.\n\nQ:  Before they received them?\n\nCarmel:  No, before they sent them.  She hated it.  She was so bored.  Because she spoke all these languages and read all these languages, she could go through the mails.  She hated it.\n\tBecause of my English and my ability to type English, I was being torn apart between various departments that wanted my services.  So I was working for the Commander of Intelligence, from eight to five, and then everybody else wanted me to come and type and translate and do.  So one of the people that was doing that was the head of the Armistice Commission, Ariel Shalev.  He used to come and pick me up and take me to his office, and I would sit and type and translate or what have you, and then he would bring me back either home or to the camp.  We did it night after night.  It was, you know, eleven o’clock, twelve o’clock at night, and I was exhausted.  I guess the U.N. was in session at that time.  They were busy with stuff on the borders.  There was lots of infiltrators on the borders in those days.\n\tAs we were driving along Shalev asked me, “Dalia, do you know anybody else that I could possibly get to do the job?\n\tI said, “Yes!  Turn left here.”  [laughs]  Eleven o’clock at night.  My friend Maureen was staying at an apartment down the road with a friend that was guarding her pregnancy.  I run upstairs.  I get her wearing a robe her hair in rollers. I say, “Come down.  I’ve got a new boss for you.”\n\tAnd she said, “Not yet.  You know I’m with rollers.”\n\tI said, “Come on.  It’s dark.  Nobody will see.”\nAriel Shalev had rotten teeth, black rotten teeth.  I guess he was afraid of the dentist.  So I introduced them at night and the next day she was transferred to his office, so I had some freedom.\n\tBut the army days, some of them were a lot of fun.  Some of them I paid dearly afterwards.  But that’s what life is all about.\n\nQ:  You paid dearly afterwards because of the results of the Lavon Affair?\n\nCarmel:  Because of the Lavon Affair, yeah.\n\nQ:  Could you explain that?  Because that is complicated.\n\nCarmel:  It is so complicated.  One must have the patience.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you explain what the Lavon Affair was, first of all.\n\nCarmel:  Well, that’s the complication.\n\nQ:  You mean that people are not sure?\n\nCarmel:  In 1954, orders were given to the commander of a unit of young [Jewish] kids who were Egyptians who lived in Cairo and Alexandria.  He was given an order to activate the unit in Egypt.  The idea was to plant bombs in American and British facilities which they would think the American and British facilities would be the target, to prove that that the Egyptians are really not capable of running the Suez Canal, which was going to be nationalized at that time.  Israel was afraid that with the Suez Canal being in Egyptian hands, we wouldn’t be able to use that maritime passage for our shipping.\nNow, the group had a local commander that used to travel back and forth from Israel and there used to be somebody else that was located in Egypt.  When they placed incendiaries in an Alexandria movie house, the incendiary exploded in the pocket of one of the guys and he was caught and then the rest of the group was caught.\nWhen the information came to Israel, no commander would take responsibility.  “I didn’t give the order.  I didn’t give the order.”  Lavon was at the time the Minister of Defense.  He’s the one that allegedly okayed the action in Egypt.  But he denied it.  He said he never heard of it.\nSo in view of the fact that this was such an important event, there was one investigative committee chaired by the ex-chief of staff, Yaakov Dori, and the head of the Supreme Court of Israel, Jacov Olshan.  So the Olshan-Dori Committee sat and investigated the matter and they couldn’t find exactly who was responsible for this fiasco.\nBut for that committee, the officer that was in charge of the unit in Egypt came to me and said, “You will do anything for your boss and you don’t do anything for me.”\nThat was at the time when Ariel Shelev would grab me to type for him over there.  So I said, “I do whatever time I have in the day.  I’m in the army.  I do anything.”  So he took me to his office and gave me stuff to alter.\n\nQ:  What kind of stuff?\n\nCarmel:  There were telexes, you know, the stuff that was from his files, being that this was not material that I worked with, I don’t remember what was what.  But there was one document that came from my files.  It was a copy of a letter from the head of the intelligence to the then chief of staff, Moshe Dayan, who was abroad, who was in the United States at that time.  The letter was two pages, and in the second page, this officer told me to add a paragraph at the beginning that read “according to instructions of Lavon, the unit was activated.”  What was written there before I changed that, I don’t remember.  The reason why I remember that so well after so many years is that he placed the paragraph where it just didn’t fit.  But that officer was so dumb.  Later on as an adult, I saw that the 20/20 eyesight should have been better at that point.\n\nQ:  Go ahead.\n\nCarmel:  Where was I?\n\nQ:  You were talking about the alteration of the document.\n\nCarmel:  Oh yes.  I remembered because it was added in the wrong context.  It would stick out to anybody reading it. This document with the other documents were presented to the Olshan-Dori Committee, and the results were that they couldn’t establish who gave the order, if it was Lavon or somebody else.  This was in 1954, the end of ’54, beginning of ’55.\n\tIn ’55, the army decided to send me away to England, so I was sent to England to work in the Israeli embassy for two years.  I came back, I worked for a little while in the foreign office, and then I went to work for Levi Eshkol, who was Minister of Finance, for whom I worked until September 4, 1960.\nOn September 16, 1960, the Lavon Affair exploded, where Lavon decided that he wants to clear his name, that he had proof that witnesses were perjured.  Perjured?\n\nQ:  Committed perjury.\n\nCarmel:  Perjury, and that there were forgeries and perjuries, and so he started the whole Pandora box.  So that’s the Lavon Affair.  That’s why it’s called the Lavon Affair.  The situation in ’54 was the mishap, security mishap, in 1960 started the Lavon Affair that went for years investigated by the attorney general, Gideon Hausner. Later a Ministerial Committee of 7, appointed by David Ben Gurion.\n\nQ:  When you say you paid dearly, what do you mean?\n\nCarmel:  I basically left the country because there was no point in being there.  There was just no point in being there.\n\nQ:  You mean that you agreed to go to England?\n\nCarmel:  No.  From England I came back to Israel and I worked for Eshkol for three years.\n\nQ:  So what did you do then, when there was no point in being there?\n\nCarmel:  First I sent to work for the State of Israel Bonds, which was a total bore.  Then I went to work for the Israel Students Organization.  In the morning I worked for the New York section.  In the afternoon I worked for the international section.  That lasted for four, five months, and then I went to work for El Al.\nSee, part of my problem was that, first of all, I was, I guess, fairly pretty, tall, intelligent, and when I walked into a room, you noticed me just because I was six foot tall.  The people around were sure that I had an affair with the Chief of Intelligence, which I did not.  When I came to give evidence regarding the altered document, I said I was convinced by the other officer Motke Benzur to alter the documents.  So the idea was that because I was in love with [Benjamin] Gilvi, the Chief of Intelligence, I’m covering up on him and blaming this other officer.\n\nQ:  But that was not true.\n\nCarmel:  So that’s chapter one.  Chapter two, it’s like literally regurgitating.  I was interrogated by [Gideon] Hausner, the guy that interrogated Eichmann in Paris in December of 1960, and I asked for permission to—I wanted to go back to Israel to tell my parents that I’m the one that is being written about, though nobody’s name was published in the papers.  So the nicknames--I was “the secretary” and somebody else was the chief officer and the other one was the officer in reserves and so on, so I wanted my parents to know that it was me.\n\tSo I organized a trip to Israel. I requested to continue from Paris and Israel, but in the press, it came out that Hausner made me return to Israel. In Israel, Hausner organized a police investigation.\n\nQ:  About?\n\nCarmel:  About the alterations of the documents.  They didn’t believe what I was saying.  They didn’t believe what I was saying.  So leave me alone.\n\nQ:  They didn’t believe that you were told to alter the documents?\n\nCarmel:  They didn’t believe that it was done.  In a confrontation between the Reserve Officer and me, the officer who  had asked me to alter the documents said “I don’t know what she’s talking about.”  So he’s a man and he’s a lieutenant colonel, and I was only a sergeant major, so the word stands by the man who has the higher rank.  So they didn’t believe me.  “You don’t believe me, let me go home.  I’m not going to fight.”  I wanted to hit him, but I was not going to do that.  So I had taken a valium in me so that I don’t carry on.\n\tSo the gossip was that I had an—the whole country was talking that I had an affair with the head of the intelligence.  Now I said, “I want to tell the lawyer of the Chief of Intelligence, I want to tell him exactly what I said so that he will know how to deal with the picture.”  The chief of intelligence agreed to drive me to his lawyer.  So off we go.\n\tAt that time I had a boyfriend.  The boyfriend was married.  I sent him a Telex from Paris saying that “I’m coming to Israel on such-and-such a flight and my parents don’t know that I’m coming.  Would you come and meet me at the airport?”  I get to the airport at three o’clock in the morning.  I’m the only person going through the airport, not one other passenger, nobody, and I’ve got a bottle of Valpolicella for my boyfriend, and he’s nowhere to be seen.  There’s an AP reporter that hangs out at the airport, you know.  He’s following me all over the place.\n\tAs I was the sole passenger arriving, I had to hitch a ride.  There was nobody.  First of all, I had no money, and there was no transportation.  There was no bus.  There was nothing at three o’clock in the morning with no passengers at the airport.\n\tSo I managed to get to Tel Aviv.  As Eshkol was in Tel Aviv on that night, and so I go to him at his hotel . I told him that, “I want to tell the lawyer.”\n\tHe said, “Let me ask the Minister of Justice if it’s appropriate.”\n\tI said, “I don’t care if it’s appropriate or not.  I feel that it’s my duty to do that.  Because of all the gossip, I want the lawyer to know exactly what I said.”\n\tSo off I go to Haifa to the lawyer.  Now, remember, the boyfriend never showed up at the airport.\n\nQ:  I remember.  [laughs]\n\nCarmel:  And I never heard from him, nothing.  I get to the lawyer’s office, and he’s in a meeting, and I’m waiting and waiting. It’s Friday and I’m waiting, I’m waiting.  I want to go home.  I’m tired.  I’m tired of life.  I’m tired of everything.  The meeting ends and out comes my boyfriend, who was in a meeting with the lawyer.  “Hello.  What are you doing here?”\n      I sat with the lawyer and filled him in on what I told Hausner.\n\tHe’s a married guy.  I can’t say, “How come you didn’t come to get me?”  So he leaves, and all I want to do is sit and cry, and I can’t.\nSo I sit with the lawyer and tell him what had gone by. When I sat with Eshkol, Eshkol waited until it was Shabbat, so he figured that I will not be able to get to Haifa, because there’s no train and no bus.  With the Shabbat coming in, I left to go to Haifa.  On the way back, we’re driving like a bat out of hell, and on the road I see the chief accountant of the Ministry of Defense.  I said, “[unclear].  I mean, [unclear].\n\tHe saw me.  He called Eshkol.  I come home.  My father says, “Eshkol called already ten times.  You did go to Haifa?”\n\tI said, “I told you I’m going to Haifa, and when I say I’m going to do something, I do it.”\n\tNow, to add complication to this life, Eshkol was in love with me.\n\nQ:  That does add complications.  How old was he?\n\nCarmel:  1960.  Wait a minute.  I don’t remember all these dates.  I don’t remember.  I think he was in his sixties.\n\nQ:  Did he act on it?\n\nCarmel:  Oh, he tried hard.  He ultimately proposed to me.  He ultimately proposed to me, but when my boyfriend came to Jerusalem to meetings and so on, Eshkol was carrying on like a lunatic.  I mean, it was impossible to work.\n\tOne day I came to work and Eshkol wasn’t talking to me.  So at one day, second day he didn’t talk to me.  Third day he didn’t talk to me.  On the fifth day, I came in early.  He was sitting and reading the paper.  I crumbled the paper and said, “Either talk to me or I’m quitting right now.”\n\t“I have nothing to say.”\n\tI crumpled the paper.  I said, “What did Dr. Arnon,” who was the Director General of the Ministry, “tell you about me that is bothering you, which is none of your business?  None of your business.  What is bothering you?”\n\t“Is it true that you have an affair with so-and-so?”\n\tSo I said, “Yes.”\n\tSo he said, “What do you do together?”\n\tI said, “Read the Bible.”  [laughter]\n\t“If anything happens, will you let me know?”\n\tI said, “I promise.  Can we start working?”  I mean, the office of the Minister of Finance is closed because he’s jealous of a secretary.  You know, this is a kindergarten.  But it made my life extremely crowded.  [laughter]  Extremely crowded.  [unclear] was sure that I had an affair with Givli.  My boyfriend wasn’t sure if I did or didn’t, so he always sort of needled me on that.  He was sure that everybody go to hell, and I’d go away.\n\n[Passages about her personal life as well as rumors about it deleted by Carmel.]\n\nQ:  Were you living alone or with your family?\n\nCarmel:  No, at that point I was living alone.  I was living in Jerusalem in a hole.  But it was interesting.\n\nQ:  So how did you resolve all of this?\n\nCarmel:  Oh, god, how did I resolve all this?  So, number one, the police did not believe me, what I was saying.  Number two, I had to get away from all these men, married men too.  No, Eshkol was widowed at that time.  But I had to get away from all of them.\n\tIn 1967 was the Six-Day War.  Eshkol was Prime Minister, and Jerusalem was taken, and I decided to go visit Israel.  No, I have to backtrack again.  In ’65, I tried to get this resolved by meeting with a very famous Haganah person, Shaoul Avigur, was a close friend of Ben Gurion, and to go to him with all the proof that I had so that he would convince Ben Gurion and they will stop haranguing.  I mean, the thing is that Ben Gurion did not believe that the army would do forgeries and perjuries.  You know, it was his holy child.  So I went to Vienna to meet Shaoul Avigur, and I brought him copies of handwritten letters from the Chief of Intelligence, writing me sort of like love letters saying that if there’d be a renewed investigation, if I change my—\n\nQ:  Testimony?\n\nCarmel:  —testimony and deny what I said before, he will come to visit me in America.  Hello?  All I needed was one more man in my life.  So at the end of the letter, he wrote, “Please destroy the letter after reading.”\n\tAnd I decided, “Buddy, I’ve grown up.”\n\tSo he wrote a second letter, that he didn’t hear from me, he’s worried, and the third letter he’s even more worried.  Then I sent him a letter back that quoted Kipling’s poem, If.  “If you were a man, my son,” and after that, I never heard from him again.  But I had the copies of the letters, both his and mine, and I went with that to  Shaoul Avigur. Shaoul took the copies and brought them to Ben Gurion, and he said, “These are love letters.  Why are you bringing me love letters?”  So he didn’t trust it.\n\tSo now in 1967, after the Six-Day War, I came to Israel to visit.  At that point Eshkol was married to a mousey lady.\n\nQ:  Where were you living?\n\nCarmel:  Here in America.  I’ve been here since September 1960.\n\nQ:  And now it’s ’67.\n\nCarmel:  And now it’s ’67.  Somehow during the time that I was there, the wife of President Ben Zvi wrote a letter to David Ben Gurion in response to greetings for her birthday or something.  A whole page in the newspaper.  [laughs]  And mentioning me, you know, that I was involved and the letters.\nSo Shaoul calls me and he says, “Did you read today’s newspaper?”\n\tI said, “No, I don’t bother with newspapers.  I stopped reading newspapers a long time ago.”\n\tSo he said, “I want you to read the newspaper.”\n\tSo I went to get the newspapers, and, oh, god almighty.  I mean, a full page went on and on and on and on.  So Shaol says to me, “I have a question to you.  Are you willing to meet with Ben Gurion?”\n\tSo I said to him, “You know, emotionally speaking, it’s a wonderful idea.  Logically speaking, it’s a waste of time.  But I always go on the emotions.  Let’s go.”\n\tSo we went that evening.  He organized it.  We went to meet Ben Gurion..”You know, and he says to me, “I know of your relationship with that man.  There was a that man and there was a this man.”\n\tAnd I had no idea what the delineation was.  Who was that man, and who was this man?  And I said to him, “Mr. Ben Gurion, I had relationships with all kinds of men.  It’s none of your business.  Do you want to hear what I have to say?  Fine.  If you don’t, let’s part ways.”  In that one minute, I had no respect for the guy, none whatsoever.  And I told him how I forged.  I said to him, “I want you to know that when you work in the intelligence, whatever you do, you have to do as perfectly as possible.”  So the fact that the police couldn’t ascertain that it was forged is because I did a good job.  And I was not a professional forger; I just thought out what I was doing so the technical side will not pop up right away to indicate that it’s an alteration.  The content side, as I told you, that paragraph popped in anybody’s eyes.  So I was shooting my arrows at Ben Gurion, and off I went home, and, for me, the affair was finished.  But I also didn’t want to live in Israel.\n\nQ:  In Israel?\n\nCarmel:  In Israel.  Everything was everybody’s business.  There is one incident that I remember that really made my—two incidents—made my blood boil.  The one incident was when I first came to Israel right after the interrogations in Paris, and the atmosphere in our home was—you could cut the air.  My father yelled, “Why did you do it?  Why did you do it?”\n\t“So I did it, you know.  Why did I do it?” \t“Why didn’t you come to discuss it with me?”\n\tSo we went to visit an old patient of his, a woman that I love dearly, and we’re sitting and talking and talking and having coffee and cake and what have you, and all of a sudden the subject of the Lavon Affair came up, and she says, “You know, I heard from our neighbor that the secretary of the Lavon Affair came to Israel yesterday, and he says she’s such a prostitute.  He knows she slept with so many people,” and she went on and on and on, and I was relishing the story, because I didn’t know who the people that she was talking about.\n\tThen I looked at my father, and he was going to get a heart attack.  So I said, “[unclear], calm down.  Calm down.  I’m the secretary.  Calm down.”  But that was one incident that, you know, when do you stop it?\n\tAnother one was during the Six-Day War when I went to Israel, I was asked by American Express, who were coming out with a brochure about Israel, and knowing that I did photography, they asked me if I could possibly photograph their Mercedes bus, a tourist bus that went from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv and vice versa.  So I said, “Well, it’s a little difficult to go chase a bus.  With whom do I talk to make an appointment with a bus?”\n\tSo they told me where to go, which travel agency to go in Tel Aviv, and I go there.  I have a carte de visite that says “Dalia Carmel, photographer,” and the head of the travel agency says to me, “I know you.”  I’ve never met him before.  He says to me, “You don’t remember, but I interrogated you at the D_____ Hotel.”  I wasn’t there.  I never saw the man.\n\nQ:  Strange.\n\nCarmel:  So I said to him, “I wonder, was I drugged?  Was I brought to the D____ Hotel in a coffin drugged?”  Then I said, “You know, I really came to find out where can I meet the bus.  I’m not interested in any of your comments.”  So for everything that you had to do, you had to go through shenanigans of the Lavon Affair.  You know, let me be.\n\nQ:  Let me ask you something.  Did you envision any kind of professional future for yourself at that point, I mean any specific one?  No?  What was your expectation about life, that you would stay working here and maybe get married?\n\nCarmel:  I was literally floating.  I would go to the opera.  I would go to concerts.  I would enjoy life, and who knows what will happen later.  No, that whole event in my life, although interesting, it sure has muddled my life.  So once I was working for El Al, it provided me with travel, it provided me with some security of the—\n\nQ:  This was El Al in New York?\n\nCarmel:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Doing what?\n\nCarmel:  Running the claims department.  But even there, I remember sitting at the general manager’s office and discussing some claim, and I saw the newspaper on his window.  I said, “Can I see the newspaper?”  It was the Hebrew [unclear] paper where on the second part of the bottom part of the first page, there was Shaoul Avigur meeting the secretary in Vienna, and our meeting was supposed to be totally secret.  So I stormed out of the office.  I was a wild woman.  I was a wild woman.  You know, this was a man that supposedly I could trust, and you couldn’t trust a sausage around, it was so bad.  However, it went on and on and on, and if you look at all the press to this day.\n\nQ:  When did you come back to New York?\n\nCarmel:  In ’67.  I was there only for two or three weeks.  The only time I stayed there longer --a year was from ’68 to ’69--was because my parents were sick and passed away.\n\nQ:  So there you were, you were working at El Al and meeting people, having a life that you enjoyed in New York?\n\nCarmel:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Were you cooking at all?\n\nCarmel:  Yes, I learned to cook.  I had to.  When I moved to New York, I got an apartment, a studio, on East 35th Street, and I went to Woolworth and I bought a set of one-ply aluminum pots, and I started to cook.  My first dishes ever were chicken curry, rice, and stone soup.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nCarmel:  And soup that nothing ever came of it.  That’s when I started to buy cookbooks, so that I could learn how to cook.  Living alone, I used to cook every weekend.  I would make a meatloaf.  I think by the time I met Herb, I could have built the Washington Bridge.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  With meatloaf?\n\nCarmel:  With meatloaf.  Both levels.\n\nQ:  Did you enjoy the cooking at all?\n\nCarmel:  I loved cooking.  What I used to do on Saturday afternoon, Saturday morning I would go to the supermarket.  I would buy whatever I fancied there, and I would come home, turn the Met opera broadcast on in the radio, every radio in the apartment, and start cooking.  By the time the opera ended, all of a sudden I had food for twenty.  So I used to call the neighbors to join in in the feast, because there was no way I could eat all that I cooked, with the tiny, tiny kitchen with my one-ply pots.\n\nQ:  Do you remember which cookbooks you used at that point?\n\nCarmel:  I used one—I think it was an international U.N. fundraiser.  In that book there was a recipe for pot roast, a Sri Lankan pot roast, and the reason why I used that was that one of my colleagues gave me a recipe for a Jewish pot roast, and when I went to do the cooking, I couldn’t find where I wrote the recipe.  So I didn’t want to call her again.  I was embarrassed.  She was having company.  So I decided I would look and whatever I had in—I had this cookbook that I was given by my orthopedist’s wife.\n\nQ:  What was it?\n\nCarmel:  The International U.N.—\n\nQ:  Oh, I see, that was the cookbook.\n\nCarmel:  And the cookbook, the Sri Lankan recipe, I didn’t have to go out and buy anything for it.  It was definitely non-kosher.  I think it was cooked in milk.  When I finished the cooking, I mean, I had to sear it and cook it and take it out and then braise it, and then take it out and then do something with a sauce and then take it out and it went back and forth.  But when I finished cooking, it was too late to eat it.  So I put it in the refrigerator, and I went to call my colleague from work who gave me the original pot roast, and I said, “Rosalee, tomorrow you’re coming to dinner.  But bring Tums for dessert, because whatever I did was very spicy.”\n\tShe said to me, “You wanted some information?  I asked the guests that I had,” and I opened the notebook next to the telephone to write down the information, there was the recipe.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nCarmel:  So I said, “Oh, well, too late.”  So that was delicious.  But I used to cook a lot and do a lot of meals with a couple of neighbors.\n\nQ:  Did you buy more cookbooks as time went on?\n\nCarmel:  All of a sudden, I got a mailing from the cookbook club, to the occupant of apartment 2A.  So the occupant started buying books from the cookbook club, you know, The Art of Hungarian and The Art of Lebanese and The Art of Middle East and The Art of—\n\nQ:  So they would send like one a month or something, and you would send it back if you didn’t want it?\n\nCarmel:  Yes.  Actually, you had to send in a card saying that you do not want the mailing, otherwise it was automatic.\n\tBeing that I went a lot to Carnegie Hall, there were remaindered bookstores on the way.  There was one on Third Avenue and 55th Street.  There was one on 57th Street between Sixth and Seventh.  I left work at five, and the concert started at eight.  I mean, those days I didn’t go to have dinner and have a drink, I used to go browse in books.  So that’s where I started collecting, collecting, and little by little, they added up.\n\nQ:  Now, at that point, you were living by yourself in a what kind of apartment?\n\nCarmel:  Yes, in a studio.\n\nQ:  In a studio apartment.  Did you continue to live there until you got married?\n\nCarmel:  Until I got married.\n\nQ:  Tell me about how you met your husband.\n\nCarmel:  I originally met Herb Goldstein in Israel when he came to meetings with Eshkol.  He was the head of the Sunol Company.\n\nQ:  Of the Sunol Company.  Herb was?\n\nCarmel:  Yes.  He had business dealings with the Ministry of Finance, so that’s where I met him.  He was tall, very tall, very formal, crew cut, bowtie, rimless glasses, very formal, and, “Hello, hello.”  Before I left for the United States I asked him, I said, “Mr. Goldstein, I’m going to New York.  Where do I meet tall men?”  [laughter]\n\tAnd he answered, “Go work in the Tall Men’s Shop.”  He didn’t say, “Wait eighteen years.  I’ll be around.”\n\tAnd eighteen years later, I met him in the street on Third Avenue and 48th Street, and, “Hello, hello.”  He remembered me.  I—\n\nQ:  You were still working for El Al?\n\nCarmel:  I was working for El Al.  As a matter of fact, I was running to a conference of the airlines, and I was running late, so I was running in order to get home, and I bumped into him running.  I thought his name was Al, and told him I worked for El Al.  I have no time to talk.  So he called me at El Al, and we had lunch, and he was so formal.  Boring.\n\nQ:  His wife was what?\n\nCarmel:  She was sick at the time.  She had lymphoma.  This was in April of ’77 when I met him, March, April ’77, and I think she passed away the end of that year.\n\tThen I met him again after I sent—his secretary asked me to send a Telex to the general manager of El Al in London who was a close friend of his, which I did, to tell him that the wife had passed away, and he called to thank me and to invite me for dinner.  I said, “No, no, no.”  That lunch was so boring.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  You didn’t say that to him, did you?\n\nCarmel:  No, no.  So I said, “One day when you stay in the city, we’ll go and have a drink.”\n\nQ:  He lived in the suburbs.\n\nCarmel:  He lived in New Jersey, in Elizabeth.  He came into town.  We had dinner.  [laughs]  He came to the house.  I had to pick something up in my apartment, and it became rather late, and I wanted to go to a restaurant called Raga, which was a very fancy Indian restaurant.  By the time we got to the restaurant, it was a bit after nine.  It was pretty late on a working day, and the maître d’ wanted us to sit there.  I said, “No, I want to sit there.”\n\t“That, too big a table.”\n\t“I don’t care.  I don’t want to sit there.  I want to sit there.”\n\tSo Herb thought, well, she’s a crazy woman.\n\tAt the next table to where I wanted to sit, Zubin Mehta was sitting with the director of the Israel Philharmonic.  So I wanted to hear what they were talking about.  [laughs]  So Herb said at the time that this was almost the last time that he saw me, until he realized what was going on, because he was always an eavesdropper, listening to other conversations, so he realized that this is what I wanted to do.\n\nQ:  Which, however, brings up a point.  Did you cook for him at all during this semi-courting period?\n\nCarmel:  Yes.  Did I cook for him?  I don’t remember.  I remember going to his apartment in New Jersey where he invited some guests, and I was cooking dinner.  I cooked and I was totally surprised that he was going to do the dishes.  I never saw a man do dishes.  And he said to me, “You worked.  Now it’s my turn.”  Fine.  I got used to it pretty fast.  [laughter]  We were a good team, because I would cook one course and go to sit down to have a cigarette, and he would come to do the cleanup in between, and I would start the next course.  We were a very good team.  He loved my cooking and he loved leftovers.\n\nQ:  Oh, how unusual.  How wonderful.\n\nCarmel:  Especially with stews and roasts, he loved soups.  He loved soup.\nI have a nice story on soups.  My mother was terrific on cooking soups, and I never got any recipe from her.  We didn’t get along five minutes in the same room.  So how do I cook?  How do I cook what she cooked?  Because she was fabulous.  So I remembered when I was in elementary school, I was six, seven years old, on my way to school, she would ask me to stop at the butcher and to ask the butcher to prepare me a shpitzen brust.\n\nQ:  Which is?\n\nCarmel:  A shpitzen brust? I don’t know.  On my way back home, I had to come and pick up the shpitzen brust and bring it home.  Then a day or two later, there was this wonderful aroma in the house, and there was this wonderful soup.  So now the question is what is shpitzen brust?\n\nQ:  Were they bones or—\n\nCarmel:  No, it was meat.  So I asked in the office all the mothers and the older women, “What do you do?  It’s a meat soup.  What is it?”\n\nQ:  So they told me buy [unclear], buy short ribs, buy long ribs.  I bought everything.  I made soups.  They were good.  It was not that soup.  So I decided, I’ll do some research.  So I call a butcher on 86th Street, and I started the conversation, “Do you speak German?”  [laughs]  I said, “If I come to you and I ask you for shpitzen brust, what are you going to sell me?”\n\tSo one butcher came back and said, “The second cut of the brisket.”\n\tI called another butcher and he said, “The first cut of the brisket.”\n\tSo I went to my Italian butcher and I bought the whole brisket.  I never saw a brisket in my life.\n\nQ:  That’s a big piece of meat for soup.\n\nCarmel:  I cut the triangle, what I guess they call the first cut, and put it in the pot with all the vegetables that I read in the cookbook, because I didn’t know what my mother put in there.  And I’ll never forget it.  I went to take a shower, and I came out.  Bingo.  That’s the aroma.  That’s the soup.  And it is a divine, divine, divine, divine soup.  As a matter of fact, I gave the recipe to Arthur Schwartz who included it in his Soup Suppers book, and Andy—I don’t remember his second name.  He was the chef of the Sign of the Dove.  He used that soup as a base for his onion soup.  But that’s a soup.\nSo for Herb I would do all kinds of soups, and he used to say, “Remember, you made the stew and I want that stew.”  Very often I couldn’t because if there was any leftover, I would leave in the freezer, and I would add it in later, and how could you repeat, you know?  Who knows what was in the previous leftover.  But he was a wonderful customer.\n\nQ:  When did you start to live together or get married?\n\nCarmel:  We started living together in July of ’78, I think July 1st, and we got married on August 27th.\n\nQ:  By that time, had your cookbook buying habit become even greater?\n\nCarmel:  When I moved, I had two small racks, metal racks, of books, about this height, and in each one there were records, the wider shelf the records, and the rest was cookbooks.  So there must have been a hundred cookbooks, which were the cookbooks I actually used.  I didn’t read them for the joy of reading a cookbook.  I would use them.  If I wanted to do an osso bucco, I’d pick one of the books up to see how to do it, because whenever we had company, I would always make things that I never made before.  I mean, I had the audacity of using my guests as, how do you call it, guinea pigs.\n\nQ:  Good for you.  Did you continue to work for El Al?\n\nCarmel:  Yes.  I worked all the way, yes.  Yes.  What happened also at work, it was funny.  I used to cook a lot on Saturday and Sunday, and if something was really came out terrific, having a recipe from a cookbook which I embellished it on my own, I would write it down, and type it in the office, and make ten copies and keep it in an envelope, because colleagues always came along and said, “Dalia, I have to make dinner, give me an idea or a recipe.”\n\tSo I would say, “Go to the drawer, take the envelope that says vegetable soup, entree, whatever, and pick whatever you fancy.”  On holidays, very often more than one of my colleagues at work used to make the brisket.  Not the brisket soup, but the brisket which I got.  I got the recipe from Annie, from Annie the—\n\nQ:  Annie Stern.\n\nCarmel:  Annie Stern, yes.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you tell me who Annie Stern was and how you met her.\n\nCarmel:  Annie Stern.  Annie and George Stern were actually friends of Herb’s, and he knew them from Haifa, because he had lived in Haifa.\n\nQ:  He had lived in Haifa, for work?\n\nCarmel:  Yes.  When he was stationed in Israel, he was working, he lived in Haifa.  Herb was not good in keeping relations going, and he didn’t like to talk on the phone, and he didn’t write notes.  One day we went to a Czech restaurant on 72nd Street.  All of a sudden, somebody started yelling, “Hey, Herb, Herb, Herb.”  There was Annie, and Annie was a very effervescent, outgoing, wonderful, gorgeous, gorgeous lady.  Herb introduced me, and we sort of hit it off, and being that we lived at 300 East 40th Street and she lived at 300 East 34th Street, it was really very close by.  So from time to time I would pop in and visit her, and she was always gracious and always, “Come for coffee.  Come for cake.  Come for soup.  Come.”  She always had goodies, always.\n\nQ:  They were both Israelis?\n\nCarmel:  They were basically Czech.\n\nQ:  They were Czech who had—\n\nCarmel:  Who had moved to Israel, then to New York City.  Then one day I was visiting Herb, being that I promised her to bring her some dried fruits and nuts from the Lower East Side, so I went to deliver it with Herb.  Unbeknownst to me, she was playing bridge.  So I didn’t want to stop their game, and it was sort of embarrassing, she stopped the game.  I think there was somebody else that sort of covered her duo, and she said to me, “You know, I know that you collect recipes.  Let me show you something.”  And she went rummaging in the back of her library, sort of behind the books.\nI said, “I don’t collect recipes.  I collect cookbooks.”\n\t“Yeah,” she said, “the same, collect recipes.”  She pulled out the notebook of the recipes that she received somehow from her mother, Mina Pachter, after twenty-five years.  Her mother had perished in Theresienstadt and had given the book to someone for keeps and to at some point send it to Annie, who at the time was living in Israel.\n\nQ:  I could be wrong.  My memory was that the book was hidden there.  No?  Or is that just a story?\n\nCarmel:  I have a difficulty in this area.  Annie had told me one story, the details of which which I don’t recall anymore.  From what I understood at the time, it was hidden somewhere in Theresienstadt, and the person, who settled in Cleveland, came back and then after years, he managed to find it.  He had gone to visit Israel and was trying to deliver it, and he was told that Annie had moved to New York City\nQ:  He knew her name?\n\nCarmel:  Yes.  Yes, because the mother had given him the name. Because Annie, by then, I think, was married.  When he was in Israel, he found out she was in New York, and I think through B’nai B’rith they found her in New York, and she managed to get the cookbook.  When she showed it to me, I was stunned, absolutely stunned, that people starving, starving of hunger, would think of chocolate cakes and onion cakes and—\n\nQ:  Now, we should explain.  These were recipes written down by people who were being held captive in Theresienstadt.\n\nCarmel:  In Theresienstadt, I mean, there were held in a concentration camp, surviving on stale bread, barley and water..\n\nQ:  They got together to have memories of the civilizations in which they lived.\n\nCarmel:  It seems, when you look at the notebook, it seems that most of the recipes were written by Mina.  It’s her handwriting.  Did they get together and she took the dictation, I don’t know.  Because there was another handwriting.  There was a Czech.  Some recipes written in a different handwriting in Czech.  Did they get together and discuss recipes, according to Bianca, they were talking recipes.\n\nQ:  Bianca was a teenager also at Theresienstadt.\n\nCarmel:  Yes.\n\nQ:  She remembered people talking about recipes.\n\nCarmel:  Talking food.  Talking food, yes.\n\nQ:  Talking food from the civilized lives that they had had before they were held captive.\n\nCarmel:  Yes.  So, now, when I saw the notebook, I said to Annie, “Annie, you’re not putting it back.  I’m borrowing it for twenty-four hours.”\n\tHerb said, “Dalia, nobody’s going to be interested.  Don’t butt in.”\n\tI said, “The world has to see this.  I don’t know how.  That I don’t know, but the world has to see it.”  And I borrowed it for twenty-four hours, and with Professor Barbara Kirshenblatt, whom I literally commanded to come to my office the next day, and we sat together and photocopied and killed the notebook, and made two photocopies, one for Barbara and one for me.\n\nQ:  You knew her?\n\nCarmel:  Who?\n\nQ:  Barbara.\n\nCarmel:  Oh yes.  I mean, I’m the one who, because I was friends with her, I called her and said, “I don’t care what you’re doing tomorrow, you’re coming to my office.”\n\tAnd then I started going out with the idea of publishing it to Beth Crossman.  She was an editor of—which company?  She was a cookbook editor in one of the publishing houses, Beth Crossman, and I talked to Rozanne Gold and Michael Whiteman about it, and I spoke to Judith Jones about it.  The editors said, “That’s too ghoulish.  Nobody would buy such a book.”\n\tAnd every time I came home, Herb told me, “I told you.”\n\tAt that time, approximately, I became a member of the Culinary Historians, and after a few months, I sort of befriended Cara De Silva and got to read some of her articles in New York Newsday, loved her writing and loved the way she wrote.  So I addressed myself to her, would she write a story about it?  And she refused.  She said it was too ghoulish.\n\tInteresting enough in those days, Nina Simonds kept calling me.  She wanted to see the notebook.\n\nQ:  How did she know about it?\n\nCarmel:  Because Barbara spoke about it somewhere.  She mentioned it.  But Nina was a Chinese food specialist.\nQ:  She was an Asian cookbook writer.\n\nCarmel:  What does she have to do with Jewish concentration stuff?  I mean, it didn’t sound right to me.  So I wouldn’t give it to her.  Cara was reluctant to do anything about it, so at some point I went to Israel and visited Yad Vashem, and found out that Yad Vashem—that interestingly enough, they had computerized all their holdings, but they did not computerize anything about food.  So my friend there who was the secretary to the chairman, asked the archivist to look through the files to find the food-related items, and she found a few collections of recipes from a few camps. One was written in like a budget book, a person would write breads, two dollars, this seven dollars.  The book, this column was the articles and this was the price, in between there were recipes written.\n\tThen in another collection, which stunned me was small three-by-three or four-by-four leaflets that on one side was the picture of Hitler and then on the other side were written recipes.  At the time, they used to throw leaflets from the air, so camp inmates collected them.  They didn’t have paper, so they collected the leaflets and on these leaflets on the reverse side they wrote, I don’t know what language.\n\tWhen I was lucky to be at the Yad Vashem, I was sick as a dog, and I couldn’t postpone my visit because I was leaving for New York back on the following day.  So I was holding everything a bit far, just in case I have to throw up, I don’t do it on the paperwork.  But while I held it, trying to read the recipes, it would flip and there facing me was a picture of Hitler, oh, god.  They were probably Hungarian but I couldn’t vouch for it.  But the fact they found for me four collections, so I had in my hand four collections from four different camps.\n\nQ:  Four collections?\n\nCarmel:  Of recipes.\n\nQ:  That belonged together by language or—\n\nCarmel:  By camp.  So when I came back and I told Cara that it’s unique and yet there were other situations like this, she should really do something about it, and she went to Renie Sax.  Renie Sax thought it was a good idea to have—\n\nQ:  Renie Sax, who was the editor, Cara’s editor, at that time, yes.\n\nCarmel:  Yes.  But not to put it in the food section.  So it was placed somewhere else, and she got an award for that, for her story.\n\tNow, one of the things before I gave it to Cara, I thought because it was in German and in Czech, it should be translated into English so somebody could read what’s written there.  I had gone to a food and wine event, and there by the coffee urn I saw Bianca Brown, whom I didn’t know, but I knew of her, I knew that she was a recipe tester or writer, whatever.  So I went over to her and I asked her if she would be interested in translating the collection into English, and I wasn’t sure should it be done in working terms, to be able to use it today or not.  I wasn’t sure.  I mean, I never dealt in this stuff.\n\tIn her meek, squeaky voice, she said, yes, she’d be interested.  So I said, “I’ll introduce you to Annie,” and I gave her my copy of the book that we had made.\n\nQ:  Now, at that point did you know that Bianca had been at Theresienstadt?\n\nCarmel:  No.  I mean, here I’m asking her if she would be interested.  She didn’t say.  There wasn’t even body language to indicate that she—nothing.  But Cara, Cara took it into her hands, and she spoke to Bianca, I guess, to know what the recipes were.  She found out that Bianca was a survivor of Theresienstadt. I was totally taken aback.  Had I known, I doubt that I would have gone to her to ask her if she would be willing to do the translation, because I would imagine that would be very traumatic.\n\nQ:  Too painful.\n\nCarmel:  Yes.  But I introduced Bianca to Annie, and they became very close friends and gave her my copy, and the rest is history.  The story came out, and then after a while and a lot of prodding, Cara agreed to make it into a book.  She had then this literary agent that was willing to do it pro bono, and the book came out in ’96 to tremendous acclaim all over, I mean every newspaper in this country and television station covered it.\n\nQ:  And the book is called In Memory’s Kitchen.\n\nCarmel:  In Memory’s Kitchen, yes.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarmel - 1 -  PAGE   \\* MERGEFORMAT 1\n\n\n\n\nTTT\nInterviewee:  Dalia Carmel\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    Session #2\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\tNew York, New York\nDate:  October 1, 2009\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  I’m with Dalia Carmel.  This is the beginning of our second interview.\n\tGood afternoon.\n\nCarmel:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  We were talking about In Memory’s Kitchen.  Play that out a little bit.  The book took a long time being published because I guess money had to be raised or—\n\nCarmel:  First of all, the issue was to find somebody that will run with it.  Cara had an agent, whose name escapes me, who was willing to take it pro bono and go to the various publishers and see.  She had the same result as I had when I first went, you know, being totally unprofessional.  I went to the various publishers, thinking that they will grab it.\n\nQ:  You mean that they thought it was too ghoulish?\n\nCarmel:  Too ghoulish and there would be no interest.  The publishers only look at the subject if it’s marketable.  I think the only time that the subject was more, was The Diary of Anne Frank, when Judith Jones found it.  I think that’s the only time that really the subject carried, and not the bottom line.  So she found this Jewish publisher, I think called Abramson, who gave very little money as an advance, I think $2,000 as an advance.\nCara, at that time, was not working.  The paper in New York had closed.  So she didn’t have any income, and she was working very diligently, very thoroughly.  Cara always, if you tell her to check the color of a wall, she will check the colors of all the walls in the building to find that one wall, so she literally wastes a lot of time.  Then when the deadline is right here, then she gets cracking, with all the nerve that go with it.  But she did it.  I guess she had to meet a deadline and she did that, and it was published in ’96.  I bet you there were two thousand copies printed the first—\n\nQ:  Initially I think there were very few.\n\nCarmel:  The first printing, I think was two thousand copies.  But it was published.  Unfortunately, Annie was no longer alive.  But the reception, the reception around the country, I don’t know if it was the whipping of Fern Berman, whipping the interest.  I mean, every newspaper, every newspaper from the littlest little towns, everybody had an article about it.\n\nQ:  Fern Berman as the publicist, who was also doing this pro bono, as I recall.\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.  So I don’t know if it was the interest in the book or Fern whipped it up into such a frenzy, because it was unbelievable.\n\nQ:  I have a feeling that she might have started calling before the Jewish holidays.  I have a feeling that there was a timing that seemed right to write the story. \n\nCarmel:  Could be.\n\nQ:  That’s my memory of it, anyway.\n\nCarmel:  Because I don’t remember the dates.  I have a ton of clippings here.  But for PBS to do a twenty-minute interview—\n\nQ:  And that was with Cara?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.\n\nQ:  And the rest of you were not involved in that?\n\nCarmel:  Bianca was very often involved and Cara a few times called me to say, before the book was published, that she was worried that once it will be out, Bianca will get all the attention and not her, because Bianca—\n\nQ:  Was in Theresienstadt.\n\nCarmel:  —was a survivor.  But very often she said she’s worried about that, so I guess she was worried about me getting some attention too.\n\nQ:  I’m not sure we talked last time about actually what was in the manuscript, so perhaps if you could describe what was on those pages, that would be good.\n\nCarmel:  On the manuscript?\n\nQ:  On the original manuscript.\n\nCarmel:  Just there were the recipes, handwritten, and some pages were very faint ink, and then there were loose pages, which I think was a poem that Mina Pachter wrote.  There were some loose pages that I didn’t look into that because what interested me mostly was the recipes.\n\nQ:  And the recipes were women who were prisoners at Theresienstadt and their recollections of—\n\nCarmel:  This I think we can surmise, because it was only recipes.\n\nQ:  We could surmise that these were their memories of the food they made?\n\nCarmel:  It could be that these were Mina’s memories of—there were some recipes written in Czech and others in Mina’s handwriting.  Mostly in Mina’s handwriting.  I don’t know if they sat together and sort of reminisced and wrote down the recipes.  I don’t know.  I don’t know.  By just looking at the notebook, it looked like the recipes written one after the other.\n\nQ:  And Annie, did she know her mother?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah, sure.\n\nQ:  I mean, her mother was alive for a period of time after this.\n\nCarmel:  After what?\n\nQ:  After the war.\n\nCarmel:  No, she died in Theresienstadt.\n\nQ:  And so Annie was also there?\n\nCarmel:  Annie was in Israel.  Annie had immigrated, and the mother did not want to leave Germany because she had an antique store and she felt that the intelligentsia was not going to be harmed, so she wouldn’t leave.\n\nQ:  You mentioned at one point hat you had shown the manuscript—\n\nCarmel:  I showed it to Barbara K-G.  I shared it with her.\n\nQ:  Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett.  Did she keep that copy?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah, sure.\n\nQ:  And do you have a copy?\n\nCarmel:  No.  I gave my copy—\n\nQ:  You didn’t want to make another copy?\n\nCarmel:  First of all—no, I didn’t.  I gave my copy to Bianca.  Somewhere around here there is a copy floating, I don’t know if here or up in my storage, that sort of wound up coming back to me, but I don’t know if it’s the complete thing.  I know that we needed the recipe for the bonbons, and the gal that was doing the movie for French TV in Paris wanted that recipe and I didn’t have it.  Wherever I looked, I didn’t have it.  Barbara didn’t know where she put hers.  I remember that the recipe was in a separate page, and Barbara looked and looked and she finally found her copy and she helped us out with the recipe.\n\nQ:  What was on French TV?  Was it a reenactment?\n\nCarmel:  I don’t know.  Actually, I had the movie, but I loaned it to friends of mine.  Anne Georgette interviewed Cara and Bianca, and went with Bianca to Theresienstadt and they sort of moved around in Theresienstadt when Bianca was showing where they were, what they did.  Then in Bianca’s home, when Bianca was cooking and baking and she was telling the story of Mina, that she interviewed Annie’s son and showed him and their family, and interviewed me and took pictures here and took pictures from the roof of my building.  Then they were taking pictures and drawings.  I should go and bring the book to you.\n\nQ:  I believe it was Annie’s son who negotiated with the Holocaust Museum in Washington.  He was the spokesperson when they were having those conversations.\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.\n\nQ:  That is now where the manuscript is, yes?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.\n\nQ:  Then after that, that part of your life closed, that relationship with—\n\nCarmel:  The relationship with Cara ended.\n\nQ:  I mean and the book.\n\nCarmel:  It took a while.  Here was another situation of anger being built.  I was so angry, I can’t begin to tell you.  And because I split with Cara, the food writers, all my friends the food writers, stopped being in touch with me.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.  They’re all Cara’s buddies.  In the beginning, I was being gracious and I wasn’t telling the story of how she did it.  Ultimately, I decided that I can hang my laundry out, and people were extremely surprised how ungrateful she was.\n\nQ:  And really all you wanted was to be the link in the chain that you were.\n\nCarmel:  Yeah, just acknowledge the fact that I’m the one that really saw the importance of the book coming out and thank me for giving it to you.\n\tI have to tell you a story that developed from this.  When the book came out, Cara put—I don’t know if she had a website, but she put the information on the Internet that the book is coming out.  And an e-mail arrived from Australia saying that a similar book was seen at the Jewish Museum in Sydney, that was owned by Edith Peer.\n\nQ:  Edith Peer?\n\nCarmel:  Edith Peer.  P-e-e-r.  Edith Peer was in the labor camp of Ravensbruck, and when she left Ravensbruck, her only possession was a cookbook, a collection of recipes that they sat together and wrote. The inmates of the camp sat together, I guess, in the free time and they wrote.\nShe moved to Australia.  When she moved to Australia, she contacted the—I don’t know if right away, but she contacted the Jewish Museum and showed the curator—I think the name was Rosenthal or Rosenblum, Rosenblum.  Rosenblum curated a show and included the manuscript in the show.\n\tThe meantime, Edith Peer decided that she’s going to have it translated and printed out of her own money.  She made five hundred copies, and she was going to donate it to a Jewish charity so they could raise funds by selling them.  The printing was done, and B’nai B’rith Sydney refused to accept the book because the recipes were not kosher.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.  As though there you are in a death camp, thinking that your memories must be kosher ones.\n\nCarmel:  Not only that, in the labor camp there were other people.  There were not only Jews.  So why would they write kosher recipes?  So B’nai B’rith refused it.  So Edith Peer was stuck with five hundred copies of the book.  I guess age did its share and she had to move to smaller quarters, so she had a friend destroy all the books minus a dozen.  A dozen were left.\n\tNow, how did I find this entire story?  Cara told me that she got this e-mail from Australia and she doesn’t have the time to look into it, so I said, “Okay, I will look into it.” \n\tI found all this information and I decided to locate the curator from the Jewish Museum and I wanted to buy the few copies that were there.  Believe it or not, I managed.  I got the last few copies.  I figured I will try and do something with that too.\nBut in the meantime, In Memory’s Kitchen came out, and I broke up with Cara.  I was not going to give her another project, and I let it sort of rot in the back shelf.  All of a sudden, somebody sent me from Israel a tiny little article from the Hebrew newspaper, telling that Yad Vashem opened a museum for things that were used during the war in the camps.\n\nQ:  Material culture.\n\nCarmel:  Material, you know, combs, cups, plates, because if you didn’t have a cup, you couldn’t get something to drink.  If you didn’t have a mess thing, you couldn’t get anything to eat.  So I thought, that’s very interesting.  And amongst the items that were given was a small collection of recipes from a woman by the name of Judith Taube, T-a-u-b-e.  Judith Taube.\nSo, you know, it stayed in my brain and I went to Israel.  I brought with me a copy of In Memory’s Kitchen for Yad Vashem because I knew that Cara wouldn’t send it to them, so I brought them a copy, and I brought a photocopy of the Edith Peer book, because I didn’t get the booklets yet from Australia.  I was still in search of who has them to buy them.  So I brought Yad Vashem a copy of the manuscript that whatever her name was, Rosenthal, Rosenblum, sent to me.\nThe museum, the Yad Vashem, was partially in the dark.  They were redoing things, so I was coming through an empty hall and I saw light sort of beyond the hall, so I decided to go in that direction, and that was the room where the curator of the new museum was sitting.  So I’m all alone.  I said, “Look, I brought you this,” and I said, “and I would be very curious to see that recipe collection of Judith Taube.”\nShe said, “Where did you find out about that?”\n\tI said, “It was in the paper.”\nShe brought out a piece of cardboard that was formed into an envelope, sort of handmade, with flimsy, thin paper with recipes.  “Take seventy-two eggs and four kilos of flour,” you know, some imaginary, literally imaginary recipes.  It seems that Judith Taube had two other friends that when either one of them was sick and they had to bring them the dry breads and water, they would give them the recipe to read so that their mind could think of nicer things.\n\tSo I said to the curator, “You know, Judith Taube was in Ravensbruck.  Edith Peer was in Ravensbruck.  Do you think they knew each other?”\n\tSo she says, “Let’s call Judith Taube.”  Judith Taube was in her eighties.\n\tSo I said to her, “You know, I have a vision that they know each other, that they didn’t know that they’re still alive, and I want to bring them together on the Oprah show.”\n\nQ:  Oh, my.  [laughs]  How fabulous.\n\nCarmel:  That’s what I wanted to do.  [laughs]\nSo she called Judith Taube.  Judith Taube is resting.  So she said, “Go, go on your way.”  I had to go back to Tel Aviv because I was leaving the next morning for New York. \nI get to my office the following day and there is a Telex on my desk saying “Bingo.”\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nCarmel:  “Yes, they know each other.”  So I was in touch with Judith Taube, and Judith Taube tells me, “You know, a very interesting book came out that you should look at.  The name is In Memory’s Kitchen.”\n\tSo I said to her, “You know, I’m the one that actually found the manuscript.”\n\tSo she says, “Where do I see it in the book?”\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nCarmel:  I said, “Well, you don’t see it in the book, but you can see that I’m mentioned.”\n\tSo she hung up.  Ten minutes later, she calls me back and she says, “This is what you got?”  She said, “Isn’t that a shande?” \n\tI said, “You know, that’s life.”  And I said to her, “What I would like to do is I got copies of your recipes, and I’ve got Edith.  Maybe one could combine them in one book, Recipes from Ravensbruck, and get that published.”\n\tSo I was in touch with Bell.  What’s her first name?  Harriett Bell, who was interested. She was then cookbook editor at Broadway Books\n\nQ:  Where was she?\n\nCarmel:  At that time I don’t remember anymore.  She changed companies so often.\n\nQ:  But in a New York publishing house?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah, in a big one.  She was interested, but one had to get the permission of Yad Vashem for the recipes of Edith Peer and the permission of the Jewish Museum in Sydney.  Well, guess what?  The director of the museum in Sydney, a rabbi, refused.  Why?  Because Sylvia Rosenblum was involved.\nHarriett Bell wanted to know how did the story come about that I found the facts about it, and I told her from Sylvia.  So she said, “You and Sylvia should write together, in an introduction, how this came about, and get the clearance from the museum, from Yad Vashem.”  From Yad Vashem I got it right away.  The rabbi said, “If Sylvia Rosenblum is involved, I do not give clearance.” \nQ:  What was that about?\n\nCarmel:  I don’t know.  I have no idea what was the issue between them.  I have no idea.  And I was not going to go into it.  I only said to the rabbi, I said, “You know, Edith Peer survived the Nazis, but between B’nai B’rith and you, you’d kill her.”\n\nQ:  [laughs] Were these recipes like in Memory’s Kitchen recipes in the sense that they reflected wartime scarcity?\n\nCarmel:  You know something, I don’t remember.  Let me—I’ll bring the booklet for you to see.\n\nQ:  Because my memory is that In Memory’s Kitchen that there were very few recipes in fact that could be made in today’s world.\n\nCarmel:  First of all, In Memory’s Kitchen, the way the recipes are written was, first of all, as if the people know how to cook, which is one element that cannot be considered today.\n\nQ:  They were not precise directions.\n\nCarmel:  They are not precise because they knew that you know that if you take an onion, you have to peel it and you have to chop it.  You don’t have to tell you, you know, peel it and that.  Then there were also ingredients missing, probably because they didn’t remember.  Either that or the shortages, I have no idea.  I mean, I’m not a historian that can build the missing links.\n\nQ:  And when you’re in a camp, it might be hard to recollect all the things.\n\nCarmel:  Yeah, I mean, you recollect the aroma, you recollect the image.  Whether you remember exactly how it was done, you have to be an extremely good cook.  And very often the people had cooks; they didn’t do the cooking themselves.\n\n\n\nQ:  This is a continuation of my conversation with Dalia Carmel.\n\tWhen all of this happened with In Memory’s Kitchen and then with the Australian manuscript, you were living here.\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.\n\nQ:  And you had lived here about how long, here in New York?\n\nCarmel:  From 1960.\n\nQ:  From 1960, on, right.  We talked before about that Lavon Affair, but we didn’t really talk about the aftermath of it and then how it played a role in your deciding to stay in the United States.  Perhaps you could tell me about that.\n\nCarmel:  You know, it was not an active decision.  When I came back from the interrogations in January of 1961, I was angry, I was disappointed, I was disillusioned.\n\nQ:  Because you felt the truth had not come out?\n\nCarmel:  First of all, you know, I was telling the truth and they wouldn’t believe me.  And there were certain things that I knew that people are lying.  Wherever I was involved, I knew they were lying.  And the way my parents behaved to me, I mean, the way my boyfriend, my parents, the whole thing—\n\nQ:  They didn’t trust you or what?\n\nCarmel:  My parents didn’t support me.\n\nQ:  Because?\n\nCarmel:  Because that’s the way they were.  In Israel, gossip was more important than fact.  So the further away I was from the newspapers and from the people, because basically, Israel is so small, you know just about everybody.  So I was delighted that I had a place to go to where I could immerse in music and opera and art and photography, in whatever, just not to be involved in the politics of the country.  And one year led to the other.  I didn’t make a decision.\n\nQ:  You were working for El Al that whole time?\n\nCarmel:  Not the whole time.  I started working for El Al in ’62.\n\nQ:  Doing what?\n\nCarmel:  I was in charge of the claims department.  So that kept my brain working, and New York kept the soul working, so, you know, I found a niche and I was happy.  I had a small studio apartment.  I had my friends around.  I didn’t make a decision that I’m staying.  It’s sort of leaves upon the water, you know, that’s where they flowed.\n\tThen in ’77 I met Herb, and in ’78 we got married, so that clinched the setup altogether.\n\nQ:  While you were in this studio apartment, were you still collecting cookbooks?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah, I was collecting, but I was collecting the books for use, from the Cookbook Club, from the remaindered stores, you know, ethnic cookbooks of cuisines familiar through restaurants that I frequented.  I was curious to see what they were, like Indian food, Hungarian food, Greek food.\n\nQ:  Did you make some of these recipes as well?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.  I cooked from them and I enjoyed that.  Whenever I invited people, I always cooked dishes that I’ve never cooked before.  There was some audacity in doing it, but I always did that.  [laughs]  And I basically enjoyed it.  You know, I built a cocoon around me, and whenever an Israeli would come into my life, I was like a bad animal.\n\nQ:  What did you think the image of you in Israel was?\n\nCarmel:  I don’t know.\n\nQ:  But what were you fearful of?\n\nCarmel:  I was fearful of the gossip.  The gossip, you know, some of it had legs and some of it had no legs whatsoever.  You know, one of the basic things that bothered me was that they believed that I had an affair with my commander.\n\nQ:  Your commander in the army?\n\nCarmel:  In the army, and that I’m covering up on him and blaming Mordecai for having asked me to alter the documents.\n\nQ:  Oh, I see.  Your commander in the army had what kind of position that—\n\nCarmel:  He was the Chief of Intelligence.\n\nQ:  I see.  And who was that?\n\nCarmel:  Binyamin Gibli.  You have the article.  Come on.\n\nQ:  Okay.  I’m just trying to get you to say it on the—\n\nCarmel:  I forget that we have a tape here.  Mordecai was one of the subordinates.  He was in charge of the unit of foreign activities and he reported to my commander, who was a colonel, a colonel at the time.  And they blame me for having an affair with him, which I didn’t.  I mean, it went all the way up the government ladder. The Prime Minister asked  me, “How come you didn’t have an affair?  He’s such a good-looking guy.”  He looked very much like Gregory Peck.\nI said, “Imagine that every good-looking guy I’m going to have an affair with?”  “How come you didn’t have an affair with him?”\nAnd then Ben-Gurion said, “You know, you admired this man and you admired that man.”\nWho is this man and who is that man?  One was Eshkol, one was Gibli, you know.  [laughs]  So in this kind of atmosphere, and then when I’d go to ask to meet a bus, they’d tell me that they interrogated me.  Who needed this?\nYou know, I told you the story that I went to the travel agency to make arrangements to meet a bus, to take pictures of the bus.  So what was the image?  Whenever there was anything written in the paper—as a matter of fact, this week there was something in the paper.\n\nQ:  In which paper?\n\nCarmel:  Not here.  In Israel.  It was forty-five years to the—forty-five years?  Fifty-four.  Yeah, forty-five years to the affair.  Let me try and show you.  It was the affair in highlights.  I didn’t print it.\n\nQ:  So which newspaper was this?\n\nCarmel:  Which newspaper I don’t know.\n\nQ:  It was a feature, as it were?\n\nCarmel:  I’ll show you.  I didn’t go so deeply into it.  I spoke to the guy that sent it to me.  Can you imagine?  I’m in touch with the girl that reported to me when in the army.  That’s fifty-some-odd years ago.  So we’re in touch since the movies came out or the articles in the papers came out.  They found me.  Here it is.  Here it is.  There you are.  It says September 2009, the history branch and heritage of the intelligence.\n\nQ:  Is that you?\n\nCarmel:  No, no, no, this is Marcelle Ninio.  These are the people that were caught in Egypt.\n\nQ:  I see.  When it failed.\n\nCarmel:  When it failed, yeah.  So there were seven; there were six men and one woman.  This guy was separate, I think.  He was on a different assignment.\n\nQ:  If it had been successful—\n\nCarmel:  Everybody would have taken credit.\n\nQ:  So none of this would have happened.\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.\n\nQ:  I see.  And you wouldn’t have had to change the document.\n\nCarmel:  Right.  She was the only woman amongst them and she tried to commit suicide and jumped off the second floor of the courthouse and didn’t succeed in killing herself.\n\nQ:  So here in New York it must have been an enormous relief to be anonymous.\n\nCarmel:  Yeah, although there were times—here’s the picture of my commander in the army.  That was his deputy.  This was Dayan.  This was Pinchas Lavon.  Hated him with a passion.\n\nQ:  You hated him because?\n\nCarmel:  I told you, from my experience, he was such a liar.  I hated him for putting people in situations like he did with me.  You know, I didn’t even go all the way down to see if my name is mentioned.\nHere is Gibli as an old man.  Here he is as a young man, a corner of him.  He died and took to the grave the actual secrets of what went on, what was the truth.  But this is September 2009.\n\nQ:  It’s amazing.  How soon, then, did you re-meet Herb?\n\nCarmel:  How soon?\n\nQ:  Yes, I mean after you came back to New York.\n\nCarmel:  In ’77.\n\nQ:  You met him in ’77, so it was that many years later?\n\nCarmel:  I meant to tell you that this was all of a sudden forty-five years later and still—\n\nQ:  And still alive.  When you were in your studio apartment, were you collecting other things besides the cookbooks?\n\nCarmel:  Record, classical records.\n\nQ:  As a collector or because you loved the records?\n\nCarmel:  I love music.  When I was single, I collected—there are two ways of collecting.  Collecting, you get a notice that such-and-such a book has come out.  You want it, you don’t want it.  This is sort of at random.  But there is collecting where you see something is out there and you’ve got to get it.\n\nQ:  You mean with a purpose.\n\nCarmel:  Or when you go to a place, knowing that there is a used bookstore, because you want to go see what’s there because there might be something that you don’t have.  And in cookbooks, sometimes you know the titles of what you don’t have that you are trying to get, but more often, the title that you never knew that existed.  Like I went to Melaka in Malaysia.  We landed in a bookstore.  My god, it was a trove of cookbooks.  I didn’t know they existed.  You know, Malayan, Singaporean, Melakan, and what have you cuisine.  You know, if Herb wasn’t with me, the whole suitcase would have been only books.\n\nQ:  When you started all of this, was it expensive to collect these books?\n\nCarmel:  Oh, my god, yes.  It’s a very expensive proposition.\n\nQ:  So how complicated was that for you to fund your habit?\n\nCarmel:  When I was single, I went to the cheap stuff.  I mean, in those days, a book was ten dollars, twelve dollars, you know, in the sixties.  And in the remainder stores, it was near three dollars, four dollars, you know.  It wasn’t that bad.  But when I became a serious collector, it was hundreds of dollars a month.  Luckily, I was married so I could use some of the funds that I earned on my job.  It was a craze, literally a craze, sometimes an absolute craze.\n\nQ:  How did your husband feel about that?\n\nCarmel:  About the funds, he didn’t care.\n\nQ:  I meant about the habit.\n\nCarmel:  About the habit, I think I told you, once Jackie Newman came to the house, and Professor Bill Lockwood and Herb realized that it’s a collection that is serious, then he didn’t mind anymore.  What he did mind is that there was no room for his stuff on the shelves by the bed. \n\nQ:  [laughs] Yes.  At its height, how big was the collection, before you gave—\n\nCarmel:  About 10,000.  I don’t know exactly.  We didn’t count.  But according to Fales, I gave them 8,500 volumes.  I’m not so sure that they’re right.\n\nQ:  But you still have more than 1,500 books here.\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.  Because I have here, I have in the dining room, I have in the living room, and I have a lot in the bedroom.\n\nQ:  How did you decide what to give them?\n\nCarmel:  I went first by the cuisines that I didn’t care for, that I never cooked from, and that went for the Japanese and Korean and Mexican and Scandinavian.  I don’t like the cuisine, so I never cooked from that.\nThen I had here really a collection of books that was really a library, a reference library.  Every book that came out about food, I had.  I said I will leave myself some dictionaries and encyclopedias, and the rest I can send to them.  There were a few books that I haven’t read, so I decided I’ll keep those, maybe I’ll get around to reading them, which I haven’t.  Then in the bedroom I had a big collection of fundraising cookbooks.  Do you know what they are?\n\nQ:  Yes, but you describe them too.\n\nCarmel:  They’re spiral-bound plastic or metal, very lovely books, but ugly.\n\nQ:  I think they’re called community cookbooks.\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.  I made a point of collecting as many as I could from Middle Eastern churches.  I was always looking for fund-raising books from mosques.  I found one mosque in Canada that came out with a fundraising book, and the Jewish books from synagogues, especially Sephardic synagogues-- you know, I don’t go to synagogues, but the books interested me.  But then amongst the fundraising books, Ashkenaz books were repetitious and the Sephardic books interested me.\n\tSo those books were in the front layer of the books in the bedroom.  When Marvin [Taylor] came, he was drooling that he was going to get these books, and I said, “Marvin, forget it.  Those books you’re not getting.  This was a labor of love to collect those, to find the churches, first of all, to assume where the churches were and then to call and to find and to get and to pay.  You’re not getting them.”\n\tThen one morning I got up.  I think I had the flu.  I said, “What are these ugly books?”  [laughter]  “What the hell are they facing?  It’s so ugly.”\nI sent most of them.  Most of them, not all of them.  Some of them, the Middle Eastern ones had stories connected of how I got them.  The Sephardic books I kept as a point of interest, but they will all go to Fales, ultimately.\n\nQ:  What made you decide to make this donation to the Fales Library?  There must be some stories involved with how that happened.\n\nCarmel:  Didn’t we start with that story?  I was sort of a little friendly with Marion Nestle from the school.  What’s the name of the department there?\n\nQ:  It’s changed, anyway. \n\nCarmel:  So I was sort of friendly with Marion, and Marion heard about my collection and she came up to look.  “Oh,” she said, “I would love to have that in the school.”\n\tI said, “Do you have a closed library?”\n\tShe said, “No, it’s open bookshelves. Everybody can come and pick up a book. ”\n\t“Thank you very much.  It stays here.”\n\tThen one New Year’s Day, eleven years ago already, I met Marion at Mimi Sheraton’s house, at a New Year’s Party, and Marion says to me, “By the way, we have a library.”\n\tSo I said to her, “You know, why don’t you send a guy, whoever is the curator, send him up to me.”\n\nQ:  But what made you willing to give them up?\n\nCarmel:  First of all, Herb passed away, so I really wasn’t cooking.  Secondly, one of the reasons that I was collecting books was to provide the food writers a source of interesting books to refer to\n\nQ:  You mean that they could come in and use your library?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah, as reference.  Some of them came to use it and thought that this was a commercial place.\n\nQ:  To do research was your idea?\n\nCarmel:  To do research, to have a reference.  They could do the research someplace else, but they could get the citations and the reference here.\n\nQ:  From primary sources.\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.  And some writers were so ungracious, you know.  Terrible.  But Paula would come and Barbara Kirshenblatt sent me some of her students.  They would come and they were nice.  They would come and sit and look and put everything back in place.  And when they cooked something, they brought a sample.\n\nQ:  Very nice.\n\nCarmel:  Really nice, nice folks.  I remain friendly with them until today.  And then Cara, naturally, Cara was the chief person.  She would call, “Dalia, can you look up this?  Dalia, can you look up that?”\nAnd the others would say, you know, “Do you have a recipe for this?  Can you tell me what it costs for—?”  And I would do that gladly, you know, whoever called.\nBut once I broke up with Cara, as I told you, the other food writers disappeared.  So what do I need all these books here?  I don’t cook. \n\nQ:  Did you want them to go to a library?\n\nCarmel:  I didn’t know what I should do, but Jackie, Jackie Newman, had a tremendous collection of Chinese cookbooks in the English language, and she gave them to the library at Stony Brook.  So that gave me the idea that it would be a terrific thing to donate it to a place that people could use it, because the collection was really a serious collection.  I had about sixty books on Hawaiian cooking.\n\nQ:  Yes, that’s serious.\n\nCarmel:  You know, when you collect, you collect one at a time, so you never realize how many are on the shelf.  When all of a sudden sixty books came down on Hawaiian cooking, my god, why so many, for the life of me, I don’t know.  You know, certain collections have a mind of their own.\n\tSo Jackie’s idea sort of took root in my mind, because the other way was to sell the collection as a whole collection, and that’s a very tall order.  Just to give you an idea, in view of the fact that we logged all the books that were given to Fales with the price that I paid—\n\nQ:  You had all of that information?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah, $100,000.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nCarmel:  And this is only part of the library.\n\nQ:  That’s the amount that you paid, as opposed to what they might be worth now.\n\nCarmel:  Exactly.  Not all the books, but some of the books are definitely more valuable no.  At some point I decided to collect books from various islands around the world, in the South Pacific, in the Caribbean.  There’s an island called Dominica, and the consulate of Dominica is up the road here on 43rd Street, so I went to see the consul there, who happened to write a cookbook.  She was a teacher of economics originally.  She gave me a copy of her draft.  The book, until it came out, took years.  When it came out, I bought it, and it’s somewhere on the shelf.\nLo and behold, after the surgery now in august, I got a physical therapist from Dominica.  We are talking, and she says, “Oh, my god,” she says, “have you got a cookbook from Dominica?”\nI said, “Believe it or not, yes.”\nShe said, “There is no cookbook from Dominica.”\nI said, “Yes, there is.”  And it’s very difficult to look for books with one arm.  [laughter]  That’s why I couldn’t find the book for you.  I can’t reach.  So I was looking, and, you know, with one arm, I couldn’t find it.  So I went online and I didn’t remember her name either, but lucky for Google, I found the name, I found the book, and the book is now $238, because there’s one copy available in London and one copy available in Frankfurt.\n\nQ:  What kind of food is the food from Dominica?\n\nCarmel:  It’s a lot of fish and curry and roti.  It’s all very similar.  But it was funny that they have some kind of empanadas that Grace, the physical therapist, liked.  So I said to her, “You can order it online, $238, and it’s a paperback.”  So that book is really totally out of line.  But I’m sure that many of the books are very expensive at this point because many cookbooks don’t have a long shelf life.\n\nQ:  That’s true.  They become dated.\n\nCarmel:  It’s not that they’re dated.  Look how many Italian cookbooks there are.  I can show you in the bedroom, I have a whole half cabinet full of Italian cookbooks and I gave Fales the equivalent of the other half.  When I decide to cook Italian food, it never tastes Italian.  It always tastes Middle Eastern.  I don’t know how to let something alone.  So I buy more and more Italian cookbooks.\n\nQ:  In the hope that someday—\n\nCarmel:  That I will learn to stop from spicing things.  And because so many cookbooks are coming out, each book is kicking the other one off the shelf, because why do you need Marcella Hazan, Arthur Schwartz, Lynn Kasper?  What’s in there?  Everybody.\n\nQ:  Everybody at the same time.\n\nCarmel:  All at the same time.  So they kick each other off the shelf.\n\nQ:  Did you keep the books that you particularly like to cook from?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.\n\nQ:  Do you have favorites?\n\nCarmel:  There is one favorite that I have.\n\nQ:  What is that?\n\nCarmel:  It’s the Love of Cooking by Uta Hagen.  I love that book.\n\nQ:  Why do you love that one?\n\nCarmel:  Because she has recipes there of dishes that are very similar to what my mother made, like chicken paprikash.  I made quite a few things out of her book.  Another book that I love is the blue book of the New York Times.\n\nQ:  The New York Times Cookbook?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.\n\nQ:  That was, and still is, a great cookbook.\n\nCarmel:  I love that cookbook.  And then I love a cookbook called Arabian Cuisine by Anne Marie Weiss-Armush.  She wrote a cookbook on Middle Eastern food that is fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.  I love Claudia Roden’s books, both the Middle Eastern and the Jewish.  But as far as Jewish cooking, as much as I love the books, I didn’t cook a lot of Jewish food.  It’s too brown.  I love chicken soup and I love soups altogether, so I used to cook a lot of soups, all kinds of soup.  I was a glutton for soup.  So, you know, I did that a lot.  Herb had a sweet tooth.\n\nQ:  Are you a baker as well?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah, and I’m a glutton for every pot.  I needed every pot.  I had to try it all and the only way you could try it was to buy it.  So if it was Calphalon or All-Clad or copper, Cusinart or Le Creuset, I had to have it all.  I have more pots than a restaurant.\n\nQ:  There was a book written about in the New York Times a couple of months back that purports to be the way French woman really cook, as opposed to the thoroughness with which the Julia Child books are written.  So I ordered it.  It hasn’t been published yet, but it sounded very interesting.  It’s slowly making its way—\n\nCarmel:  I was turned off French cooking.\n\nQ:  I was just curious to see what the difference would be.  You were turned off it because?\n\nCarmel:  Because some of it was too long to do.  Some of it was too long.  Some of it had too much butter, too much cream and too much fat.  Given a choice in going to a restaurant between an Italian and French, I would always choose Italian.  When I choose to cook Italian, it winds up to be Middle Eastern.  But it’s a disaster.  Herb would never let me cook a steak.  I killed them too.\n\nQ:  But they’re hard to cook perfectly if you’re indoors.\n\nCarmel:  He used to cook the steaks and the baked potato.  He would call me in the office and he would say, “Dalia, today just call me before you leave the office.  I’m cooking today.  He bought the meat, He bought the potatoes.”  And he was doing the cooking and I was doing the cleaning up.  But he would never let me, never let me touch a steak.  [laughter]  He would get shoe leather.\nBut no, French cooking, I had the whole cabinet, one half of Italian cookbooks, and the other half was French cooking.  I used Julia Child’s cookbook once for one dessert.\n\nQ:  Which one was that?\n\nCarmel:  How was it called?  Crème Bavaroise à l’Orange.\n\nQ:  Oh, that sounds serious.\n\nCarmel:  Four pages.  Herb invited members of his distant family who were known to be very good cooks and very good bakers.  There were two sisters living in the same building.  One did the cooking, one did the baking, and whenever you were invited to them, you had the dinner in one apartment and then for dessert you went to the other, Kitty and Netty. And I decided that I had to shine.  I had to show off.  And whenever I was in the kitchen, I had to be a showoff if I had company.  In creative areas, in photography also, when I go to class, I go to show off, which is childish, but enjoyable.\nSo I decided to do this Bavarian crème, and at one point I was holding two hand mixers, whipping cream and egg whites, and Herb comes by and I said, “Oy, Herb, can you flip the page?  Flip the page.  I have to read the third page.”\nThe result was outstanding, outstanding.  When I brought it to the table, I said to the guests, “You have to eat it very slowly.  Relish every teaspoon, because I’m never going to make it again.”  [laughter]\nI didn’t see the movie yet of Julie and Julia.  Did you see the movie?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nCarmel:  And you liked it?\n\nQ:  Yes and no, but it’s a sweet movie.\n\nCarmel:  I didn’t see it.  There’s a movie that is starting on the ninth that I’ve got to see.  I have to tell you about it.  When you talk about Julie, Julie was cooking every page.  I had enough with the four pages.  [laughter]  But I love to cook unusual stuff that I’ve never seen before.  I had company and I decided to have a Sudanese dinner.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.  Had you ever had Sudanese food?\n\nCarmel:  No.  So I had a book that had—I don’t remember which university it came from.  It was a fundraiser.  Professors and professors’ wives gave recipes and there was one woman that gave Sudanese recipes.  So there were enough to make a dinner and there was some kind of lamb and okra.  I cooked it exactly according to the instructions because I had never had it before, and, oh, to serve it en famille was terrible.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Because of the okra?  Yes, tell me.\n\nCarmel:  Because if you put the ladle in there and you lifted it, all the—\n\nQ:  Fuzz.\n\nCarmel:  Not fuzz.  Gunk.\n\nQ:  Slime.\n\nCarmel:  I said, “Please.”  I said, “How am I going to serve this?”  It tasted delicious.  So the woman was from Maryland—American married to a Sudanese.\n\nQ:  Your guest?\n\nCarmel:  No.\n\nQ:  The person who had submitted the recipe to the fundraising book?\n\nCarmel:  So I—\n\nQ:  Called her.  [laughs]\n\nCarmel:  I called her and I said, “I’m making your Sudanese meal today and, I mean, you cannot bring this to the table.  People are going to run away.”  [laughs]\n\tSo she said, “You know what?  Why don’t you put the rice on the plate and serve the stew on the rice and bring this to the table.”\n\tI said, “You’ve got a point.”  And it went over well.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  But you never have made it again.\n\nCarmel:  No, but, you know, the thing is that she used long lady fingers.  Had I done it again, I would have bought the mini okras that you can get dried or frozen from the Middle Eastern store, and without cutting those, then you don’t have that slime.  Blech.  I never forget that.\n\tI had two situations.  I decided once to make a mousse of prunes.\n\nQ:  [laughs] That is an unusual decision.  I like prunes, but I’ve never thought of making a prune mousse.  It probably was very good.  How did you lighten it?  [laughter]\n\nCarmel:  Good, but the color.  And when you put the cream and the egg whites and the lemon, the color looks like baby shit.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Where did you find the recipe?\n\nCarmel:  Here. \n\nQ:  Oh, I see.\n\nCarmel:  And I’ll never forget, I invited the lawyers that I worked with through various companies, and we were very close friends.  So one of the lawyers comes in the kitchen.  He says, “What the hell are you making?”  He says, “I can’t eat that.”  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Oh, my.  Tell me something.  What is your hope for the books that you have given to the library now?\n\nCarmel:  I know that the students love it.  I had an e-mail from some student saying that she was looking for particular information from a certain book all over the city and nobody had it, and she said, “And here it’s at Fales,” and it came from my library.\n\nQ:  Oh, that’s wonderful.\n\nCarmel:  So it’s nice to know.  It’s really nice to know that it’s being used and Marvin—I hope he lives long enough—is treating the books so gently, because my books, you know, if I took a book to the kitchen, I never took it to the kitchen.  I would put it in the dining room table and go to the dining room table to check the recipe.\n\nQ:  Oh, you mean you were very careful not to get them dirty?\n\nCarmel:  That’s right.  But what I did mostly, if I decided on a recipe or a few recipes together, I would make photocopies and bring the photocopy to the kitchen.  I would never bring the book.  I told you that whatever I made, I used to come to the office and type the recipe and make multiple prints, and people could come and take copies so they would leave me alone and just pick recipes from the envelopes.\nWhen I left El Al, I had a darling boss who overstayed his welcome in the company by many years.  I think he retired at age eighty-five, eighty-three, eighty-five.  He became forgetful and he lied that you could die.  He was American in an Israeli company, so he had a lot of problems, and rightfully so.  They tried to get him to leave somehow, so they chopped his personnel one after the other.\n\nQ:  His staff?\n\nCarmel:  Yeah.  He stayed and he would become nasty to the personnel that was left.  The last year, two years, we had a terrible relationship, terrible.  You know, I had no respect.  He lied, you could die.  For instance, he would tell me that he’s going to the lawyer’s and not to call him, he will call.  All of a sudden, the general manager is looking for him.  “Where is he, where is he?”\n\t“He went to the lawyer’s.”\n\tHe had a house in the country in Carmel, so I would call the house in the country and he answered the phone.  And he said, “How did you find me here?”\n\tI said, “Didn’t you say that you were going to the lawyer’s?”\n\tOr he hated to make decisions.  He would be in the country and he would call in and I would want to talk to him.  He would be in a phone booth.  He’s in a phone booth, and he would tell me, all of a sudden, “Oh, I’m sorry, Dalia.  I have a call from Israel.”  [laughter]  “I can’t talk to you now.”\n\nQ:  When did you decide to leave?\n\nCarmel:  To leave what?\n\nQ:  El Al.\n\nCarmel:  In the beginning of ’99.  Herb was sick.  I couldn’t stand my boss.  I couldn’t stand it.  I used to love him, adore him for many years.  I loved him.  You know, we were good friends.  He did my wedding, to give you an idea.  I mean, we were really close friends, but it became sour.\n\tSo one of the things, because of my relationship with all the food writers and with Cara, Cara would call you—she never asked, “Are you in the middle of anything?”  Never.  “How much salt did you say I had to put there or what was—?”  Cara, no, she’s got to have it now or she would need a connection to somebody who was Yemenite, or somebody who was Libyan.  We had in the company a variety of people from all over.\nI would say, you know, “Hold your horses.  Tell me and I’ll—.”\n\t“No, no.  Right now.”\n\tI said, “You know, we’re working in an office.”  So as a result, you could overhear that I was talking about food while I was working on claims.  My boss made me always give recipes to his wife.  But when they gave me sort of a go-away party, my boss got up and said, “You know, whenever you passed by the office of Dalia, you would hear classical music and recipes, but in spite of it, she managed to save us enough money so that we could have this party.”  Well, he’s another one I don’t talk to anymore.\n\nQ:  So you stopped working then—\n\nCarmel:  In April of ’99.\n\nQ:  I mean you stopped working there.\n\nCarmel:  And I never worked again.\n\nQ:  I was going to ask you.  Well, never worked in that context again.\n\nCarmel:  First of all, Herb was sick until 2003, when he died.  So first I was taking care of him here, and then I transferred him to a nursing home for a year and I was in the nursing home every day.  Once he passed away, I cleaned papers or what have you, and then I decided to go back to my first love of photography.  I went to classes and moved into digital.\n\nQ:  Very impressive.  And when you cook now—or do you cook?\n\nCarmel:  Do I you cook now?  What is that?\n\nQ:  Thank you, Dalia.  This is really so interesting.\n\nCarmel:  I put eggs on the stove.  I love hard-boiled eggs.  The moment I put them on the stove, I forget that they’re on.  I’d be sitting here and I’d say, “What the hell is that noise?  The eggs are calling.”  [laughs]\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarmel - 2 -  PAGE   \\* MERGEFORMAT 1\n\n\n\n\n","description":"Food scholar Dalia Carmel has been called \"the angel of American food writers\" because she made her 11,000-volume personal library of cookbooks available to all who asked.

Along with that and the attention to the profession given by the media, a new category has emerged: the Celebrity Chef. No one of them is better-known than Tom Colicchio. Already a highly respected and well-reviewed chef and restaurateur when he became the head judge of the wildly popular television program Top Chef, Colicchio is probably the best-known chef in America.\r\n\r\nAs a young teenager, he started cooking at home, discovered he enjoyed it and worked his way through a swim club food concession, a Burger King, and increasingly more ambitious restaurants in his native New Jersey before heading to Manhattan. His teachers were his on-the-jobs training, the chefs he worked for there and in New York and books, especially Jacques Pepin's on method and technique.\r\n\r\nHe came to wide attention at the Gramercy Tavern in New York's Flatiron district, and then at Craft nearby.\r\n\r\nThe recipient of five James Beard Foundation awards, today Colichio and his cooking can be seen not only at the Craft restaurants (including Craftbar and Craftsteak) in New York, LA, Dallas, and Las Vegas), but also at Colicchio and Sons in Manhattan's Meatpacking District. In 2003, Colicchio and two partners founded the more affordable sandwich and salad outlets, 'wichcraft. In 2010 his work at Craft was honored when the Beard Foundation named him the country's Outstanding Chef.\r\n\r\nColicchio is married to his frequent writing partner, the documentary filmmaker Lori Silverbush.\n\n\nInterviewee:  Tom Colicchio\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t           New York City\n\nDate:  April 19, 2011\n\nQ:  It’s April 19, 2011.  This is Judith Weinraub, and I’m at Tom Colicchio & Sons downtown. \nGood afternoon.\n\nColicchio:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  Let me ask you just to start out by telling me something about where and when you were born, and what your parents were like, your early education.\n\nColicchio:  Sure.  I was born August 15, 1962, in Elizabeth, New Jersey, at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital.  I am the second born to Beverly and Thomas Colicchio, an older brother, Michael, and a younger brother, Phillip.  My father, when I was born, he was a barber.  He had a barber shop.  I think when I was around eight or so, he sold it and he became a correction officer in the county jail.  My mother was a stay-at-home mom until I was around twelve or so, and then she took a job in a school cafeteria, managing a school cafeteria.\n\nQ:  I read that.  I thought it was interesting.  Did you ever go to the cafeteria with her?\n\nColicchio:  To eat or to—\n\nQ:  Just to look around.\n\nColicchio:  I was in there school there, so I’d stop in.\n\nQ:  Oh, it was at your school?\n\nColicchio:  Yes.  This was in Elizabeth High School.  I was there for sophomore year and senior year.  I didn’t spend a lot of time in the lunchroom, but occasionally I would go there.\n\nQ:  Did people know that the person [unclear]? \n\nColicchio:  We had four thousand kids in our school.\n\nQ:  Got it.  Okay.  What was the atmosphere surrounding food in your home?\n\nColicchio:  Food was always important growing up.  We had to be at the dinner table every night.  It’s not like it is today, I think, where it’s kind of maybe you get there, maybe not, but we were obligated to be there every night whether my father was home or not, didn’t matter.  But food was important.  My mother and father were both pretty good cooks.  My mother had her standard twenty recipes that she would cycle through, and my dad would go out and come back home and try new things.  I think, looking back on it, my mother was a typical mom who would cook and make sure everybody was served and taken care of before she would sit down.  It was her way of showing love and showing that she can take care of her family, how she took care of her family.\n\tSunday was always really important.  Sunday was Sunday gravy, growing up Italian American in New Jersey.  We called it gravy, and macaroni, not pasta.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you explain what gravy is.\n\nColicchio:  I will.  I will.  Sunday gravy, you know, there’s a lot of discussion whether it’s sauce or gravy.  Marinara is a sauce.  The second you put meatballs and sausage and braciole and pork butts into sauce, it becomes gravy.  The actual definition of gravy is a sauce made with meat drippings, and so I think that qualifies as meat drippings.\n\tBut Sunday, we would go to church and get home around eleven o’clock.  My mother would save us some of the fried meatballs before they would go into the gravy, and so we would always have that.  Occasionally there was bacon and eggs in the morning, well, more than half the time.  We would do that and then go to church, or vice versa, we’d come back and have bacon and eggs, but always have fried meatball.  Then we would sit down and have dinner around three or four o’clock.  There were always other relatives that would stop in.  But it started off with macaroni and a sauce and then a big platter of the meat and stuff.  Then we would have a salad afterwards.  But that was every Sunday.  It was like a religion.\n\tHolidays were always pretty big.  My grandmother would do Christmas Eve and it was always fish.  I took that over and I do it now.  There was always fried smelts, baccala two or three different ways.  My grandmother would fry it.  Well, I never knew if it was my grandfather or my grandmother who was actually doing the cooking.  She would also steam it and flake into a salad with just olive oil and parsley and some garlic.  There was a beet salad that I still do to this day that my grandfather would make.  It was beets and celery and artichoke hearts, sheer black olives, hot cherry peppers, anchovy, parsley, garlic, olive oil, a little red wine vinegar, and jardinière, the canned jardinière.  I make that every Christmas Eve.  I think he also would buy canned beets.  I’d make everything.  It’s a favorite of my brothers and I.  We have to have it.\n\nQ:  Where did he come up with that?\n\nColicchio:  You know, I’m not sure.  I don’t know.  I don’t the origin of that dish.  I thought it was my grandmother’s, but I was corrected.  It was my grandfather who would do it.  I really don’t know.  They were born here, my grandparents, my mother’s side of the family.  I don’t know the origins and my mother doesn’t know, and they’ve both passed on, so I don’t know if we’ll ever get it straight.\n\nQ:  In Jewish homes you’re used to beets, but I didn’t know they had made their way into—\n\nColicchio:  Yes, it did.  We’d have pasta with just garlic and olive oil.  So I do that dinner now.  It’s a two-day prep job for me, but I expand on it a little bit.  I still do the baccala salad and I still do the beet salad.  I have a lot of other things I do, a cacciucco, which is a big fish stew.  I also have some crudo, plus I also do fritto misto when people are sort of showing up.  So it’s expanded a bit, but some of the dishes that my grandparents did were there.\n\tMy mother would do Easter, and she would make homemade manicotti and she would make the crêpes and make that.  That was always a real treat.  So, yes, food was really important.  It was my father, when I was fifteen, who suggested I become a chef.\n\nQ:  I’ve read that, but what was it about what your participation in the kitchen was or your interest?\n\nColicchio:  I started cooking at home when I was about thirteen and just found that I just enjoyed it.  I remember one of the first things I cooked at home.  My cousin Patty had a beauty salon, a hairdresser, and I remember going to get my hair cut and my mother going as well, and I was sitting there waiting.  I picked Cuisine magazine.  Cuisine magazine is long defunct.  I remember picking it up and I read this article on Cajun cooking.  Now, this was long before Paul Prudhomme.  I was thirteen years old.  This is thirty-five years ago.  I remember reading about this particular kind of food and how it was typically done by women who worked in people’s homes, and they would keep the tradition going on, and how this sort of was a combination of slaves that were brought over to work in the fields, but also a population that emigrated down from Acadia in Canada down to New Orleans.  So it was this amalgamation of different cuisines that created this Cajun—it was Cajun cooking; it wasn’t southern cooking.\n\tBut there was a dish.  I read this article, and I said, “Oh, this is great.”  I remember looking at this dish and saying, “Oh, I think I can make this dish.”  I was a thirteen-year-old kid.  Because there was a picture of it.  It was an eggplant that was cut in half.  It was roasted, hollowed out, and then stuffed with eggplant, zucchini, onions, peppers, and shrimp and spices.  You put the whole thing back into the eggplant and then bake it in the oven.  I was, “I can do this.”\n\tI probably would have been diagnosed with ADD if I was a kid today.  I had a hard time reading through recipes, but this particular one, I didn’t realize it was an appetizer.  So I made it and put it on the table, and my family was like, “Okay, where’s the rest of the meal?”  So my mom had to bail me out.\nI was very interested in food.  It came very easy to me.  To me, it was a very simple thing to do.  I would read through books and just try things.  My dad was very supportive.  In fact, I think when I was about fifteen, he came home with a stack of books, probably from the jail library.  I’m not sure exactly where they were from, but there was a New York Times Cookbook and Joy of Cooking and things like that.  But one book in particular stuck out; it was Jacques Pépin’s La Technique.  It was a picture book.  I remember reading the foreword, and Jacques talked about how techniques and methods are what’s important, not so much recipes.  I latched onto that because I had a hard time reading through recipes.  I would look at them and go back and went back and back, and I couldn’t really follow them.  I could read through them, but it was just like you get confused by them.  So I remember reading the foreword, and the last sentence said, “Don’t treat this book as cookbook.  Treat it as an apprenticeship.”  And I was like, “This is great.”\n\tHe talked about knife skills, and I would go home and buy celery and just practice knife skills with the celery and throw the celery out.  It’s a cheap way to do it.  I would make chicken stock and then make consommé, and it all kind of worked.  I’d make creampuffs.  I remember he had a recipe for actually showing how to make a creampuff swan, and I would do it just to see if I could do it.  There were some silly things like take an olive and make a rabbit out of it, and whatever.  That was kind of amusing with your friends.  But I found it was easy.\n\tDuring this time, fifteen, sixteen, I was a very good swimmer when I was young, when I was eight or nine years old, and it came very easy to me, but I got to certain point I stopped practicing and stopped working hard, and the kids who I beat when I  was eight to thirteen, they were beating me.  So I kind of promised myself if I found something else that I really loved to do and that came easy, that I would work at.\n\nQ:  That’s very disciplined for a kid.\n\nColicchio:  Cooking became that thing for me, although I was never disciplined.  I don’t know why this particular thing I gravitated to, because I would never categorize myself as a disciplined person.\n\nQ:  Were you competitive?\n\nColicchio:  Yes.  Growing up with two brothers, yes, we were all very competitive.  But for me, I think partly it was a love of food.  I think part of it was not expecting the sort of affirmation from my parents that I got.  My dad was not a very talkative person.  In fact, when he would take me to swim practice in the winter, we’d have to drive about forty minutes, and it was a horrible forty minutes because it was two or three words spoken the whole time.  So it was like one of those things that you can’t wait till you get there.  On the way back, at least we’d talk a little about practice.\nSo when he took an interest, I think it was important, and I think he did that with my other brothers as well.  My younger brother played a little basketball in college and was really into ball, and he’s a coach, and actually very good at what he does.  A couple years back he won Metro, New York Metro Area Coach of the Year for high school.  My older brother was very much into numbers.  He was an accountant, CPA, then went on to do other things in business.\nSo it was this interest, and then when I was about sixteen or so, fifteen, sixteen, somewhere in there, my dad suggested I become a chef.\n\nQ:  What do you think made him so open to this fairly unusual idea?\n\nColicchio:  I think that my dad was a correction officer and almost certain he derived zero joy out of that job.  Nothing at all.  I mean, think about that job.  So I think that he instilled in us, “Find something that you like to do and do it.  Don’t worry about money.  Just find something that you love.  You’ll probably be good at it.”  I think my mother and father’s idea of what a chef would be, that I would stay in New Jersey and end up at some Italian restaurant somewhere.  My family, cousins and stuff, were just like, when I said, “I’m going to be a chef,” they were horrified.\n\nQ:  I was going to say, did anybody tease you?\n\nColicchio:  No.  No one teased me, but my family was one of those families that they would all talk behind your back, you know, immediate family, cousins and stuff.  And I’m sure they’re all going, “This is a crazy idea.”\n\tI also decided not to go to college.  My brothers were all in college and my cousins, and I think they were all kind of concerned for me.  They really just got this vision of sitting in a kitchen somewhere in a wife-beater T-shirt, with a cigarette hanging out of my mouth, stirring a pot of sauce.  I mean, I think that was the vision of what I would sort of amount to.  So I certainly had no idea what it would turn into.  That wasn’t the point.  The point was I love food.\nSo various things just kind of happened to get me into a kitchen.  The first job, I was about fourteen years old.  My parents belonged to a swim club in Clark, New Jersey, and the guy who ran the food concession, the snack bar, hired me one summer to scoop ice cream and [unclear] the cash register or take orders, and he was going to do the cooking.  Within one week, I was doing all the cooking.  He was scooping ice cream.  Best job I ever had in my life.\n\nQ:  What kinds of things did you make?\n\nColicchio:  Well, he would pick me up in the morning because he lived in the same town I did.  So he’d pick me up in the morning, we’d go and buy some provisions, we’d get there and get the shop opened up.  We would make things like grilled cheese sandwiches and hamburgers and steak sandwiches, and sometimes I’d make barbecued ribs.  You know, snack bar kind of food, very simple stuff.\n\tBut I was known for making these great grilled cheese sandwiches and just figured out a way to do them.  This stuff came easy.  I was a short-order cook when I was fourteen years old.  When we’d get busy, I’d hold down a line and have like ten tickets up.  Then we would also do picnics and stuff for around the Fourth of July and Labor Day, Memorial Day.\nI would work in a pair of cutoffs, no shoes, maybe a shirt sometimes, it all depend, and no socks, and he was paying me $275 a week under the table.  I was fourteen years old.  It was the best job I ever had.  It was great.  But what that job did, really, it taught me how to use heat and how to cook, how to work a line.  That lasted, I think, two seasons.\n\tThen second job I had—well, actually I should take a step back.  The first job I had in food, my uncle ran a vegetable stand in the outdoor market in Elizabeth, New Jersey, my Uncle George.  When I was ten, on Saturday mornings I would go there and help him.  So that was my first job in food.\n\nQ:  Was it big, the market?\n\nColicchio:  No, no.  It was a block long.  Actually, I think it was a little larger.  Years back, there was a live chicken market there.  But it was just basic produce, nothing special.  It was in the Italian section of town.  He sold potatoes and string beans and broccoli and cauliflower and potatoes and apples and stuff like that.  So I would go there and help set up and then I would sell stuff.\n\tThen I remember there was a diner, a little sort of lunch counter or something right near where our stand was, and I would go there and get coffee.  I was actually drinking coffee back then.  My uncle and my aunt would let me drink coffee at home.  That’s why when I was there I would drink coffee and get an apple turnover, and that was my breakfast.  I remember that.  I hated it when it was cold.  The other thing I hated more than anything was the smell of rotting citrus fruit, because people would just take the stuff at the end of the night, the stuff that was rotten, and throw it in the street.  It was just horrible.  It was all soft, \n\tAnyway, so, move up now, the second cook job I had, not so glamorous.  There was a Burger King opening up in town, so two hundred kids show up to apply.  I know I’m getting this job.  I’m the only fifteen-year-old with experience cooking, so I’m getting this job.  [laughter]  And I did get the job.  It didn’t last.  It wasn’t my favorite thing in the world.\n\tThen I start working weekends in a restaurant in town called Evelyn’s.  It was a seafood restaurant.  The original one was in Belmar, New Jersey, and it was bought and then they opened a second store in Elizabeth, where I grew up.  My father’s friend did the air conditioning for them, so I got a job working as a busboy, as a busser.\n\nQ:  This was a tablecloth restaurant?\n\nColicchio:  Not really tablecloth; it was a big seafood restaurant, everything from fried dishes to broiled dishes to lobster tails and king crab legs.  It was before Red Lobster.  It was that kind of restaurant.  The original was actually quite nice.  There was a woman who owned it, Evelyn, who opened up a little shop making fish dishes for the construction crew.  They were building a bridge over the Shark River Inlet in Belmar, New Jersey, and so she opened up right there, and it was very successful.  It was a mainstay of Belmar, New Jersey.  I think it’s closed now.  So I got a job bussing there.\n\nQ:  This was after school?\n\nColicchio:  Only on weekends.  Fridays and Saturdays I would do it, and sometimes Sunday lunch, depending.  Yes, it was fine.  It was all right.  I was making some money.  I started working there right out of high school in the kitchen.  So I graduated high school in 1980 and took a few months off in the summer.  I think it was towards the end of the summer I start working in the kitchen, and I start working in the prep kitchen.  It was just hard, long hours.  I mean, I worked minimum eighty hours a week, and it was peeling shrimp, chopping up king crab legs, cracking lobsters.\n\tI remember one of the first nights I was there—see, it wasn’t like I was new to the restaurant.  I knew everybody because I’d worked there before.  So I started working in the prep kitchen, and the prep guys would give me a hard time.  I’d go downstairs.  After working eight hours, they’re like, “You got to do this before you go home,” and they’d put a tub of a hundred pounds of shrimp in front of me.  They’re like, “That’s yours.”  I’d start peeling.  I think I fell asleep over the tub and one of the waitresses came down and woke me up.  But that went on for a while.  It was like the hazing thing you kind of go through.  It was fine.  I was a seventeen-year-old kid.\n\tSo eventually I got out of the prep kitchen.  Step back for a second.  There was one guy in that restaurant who was—there was a whole cast of characters.  I remember them all.  Bob Donnelly, who passed away a little while ago; and Alfred, who was the chef, Molina, I think his last name was; Stuart Stoltz, who was like the GM of the restaurant; Ellie, this cast of characters.  Ramone, who worked what they called the bench, which was where they started all the orders.  He was the head oyster and clam shucker.\n\tThen the fry station was really amazing because you would get the orders in, someone would pass you the orders—really an organized kitchen—someone passed the orders down for fry station, and if you were working the batter, the area, there was usually two people who had to bread everything to order.  They actually bread everything to order, so you had these bins of different flours and stuff, and you had your bins of seafood iced down, and so if they called an order for a fried seafood platter, you knew it was two scallops, two shrimp and whatever.  You’d throw in the flour and then you passed it over to the cook, who was sitting where you’re sitting, or standing where you’re sitting, and he’d pan it and then he would fry it.  So it was this whole production.  So I was eventually able to work the line.  When I first started out, I was really bad at it.\n\nQ:  This was how old?\n\nColicchio:  Eighteen or so.  Let me move back a second.  So, cast of characters, but there was one guy in the restaurant, his name was Slim, and Slim was an older African American gentleman who was from down south originally, and would tell me stories.  He was very, very quiet.  Everyone in a restaurant would run around, you know, busy restaurant.  He would never move fast, just steady, slow.  But he was the head prep guy, but he was the one who did all the cooking, not the cutting and the chopping.  So he made all the sauces for the Lobster Newberg and Oysters Rockefeller and that kind of stuff, and made the stuffing for the stuffed crab, all the more advanced cooking.  They had this recipe book, and he just kind of brushed it aside and did his own thing.\n\tHe would tell me stories about working in hotels and working down south and how he came up, and took me under his wing a little bit.  I always remember him tasting everything, constantly.  He was the closest thing to a mentor that I’ve had, and I’ve worked for some pretty good chefs over the years, but I don’t consider anybody to be a mentor.  But he was a special guy.\n\tSo I ended up working through every station of that restaurant.  I worked on the line.  I never did get to work fish broiler.  That was a deep position.  I worked the fryer, I worked the breading station.  You went from the bench, opening clams and oysters and setting everything up, and then eventually worked on the line, worked fryer.  I worked in the bakery, paste for the bakery.  It’s a horrible job.  I hated it.  I used to make, like, twenty cheesecakes a day and these lemon chiffon pies.  The oven racks would always fall.  I’d have my cheesecakes going and start rotating them, and the racks just would always cave in and destroy my—I mean, it was just so frustrating.  But it was, I think, a great place to start working.\n\tFrom there, I ended up going to a “red sauce” Italian restaurant called Chestnut Tavern in Union, New Jersey, owned by a woman.  Her name was Dee, and her son just ran the restaurant with her.  Her one son Richard had some kind of culinary degree from the local community college, I think.  He also taught there.  But he wasn’t really the chef.  There was a chef in the restaurant, but he was running the place.  The younger brother was kind of a screw-up who just preferred to golf, and he’d always come walking in after golf and he didn’t do much in the restaurant.  There was a tight kitchen crew.  I was hired to take the place of an older guy who was retiring and he was quite slow, and I was a fast kid, so I got all my work done.\n\tQuick thing about that job, the food was okay, but the great thing was I learned to butcher there.  We would butcher, I think, eight to twelve legs of veal a week.  When I say legs of veal, we’d get the leg of veal and we’d break it down completely, seam it out, break it down, and then it was all pounded for veal cutlets or we would use the tenderloins for Veal Scaloppini, whatever it was.  So I learned how to do that, break down legs of lamb.\n\nQ:  Who taught you that?\n\nColicchio:  There was one guy—what was his name?  I think his name was Stan, maybe, who would do that in the morning.  It was actually a good lesson, and I found later on that it was something that you don’t really get to learn in restaurants.  A lot of restaurants, the serving comes in portioned, or someone’s doing it and you don’t get to see it.  So that was a great lesson.\n\tFrom there, I took a job at a restaurant called—I think this is the sequence, yes—40 Main Street.  Forty Main Street was in Millburn, New Jersey.  Danny Cannizzo was the owner of the restaurant.  I’m still friendly with him.  In fact, he texted me a little while ago.  I answered an ad for a sous-chef, but it was already taken when I got there, so I took a cook job.  Sous-chef was a guy named Jerry Bryan, who I’m still great friends with, and the chef’s name was Jim Smith.\nIt was the kind of place where we would change the menu every day.  It was kind of neat because we’d all come in at twelve o’clock in the afternoon and we would sit down around a table, and I was a cook there, but I was allowed to sit there and participate.  In fact, it was the whole kitchen staff.  He would say, “Okay, this came in today.  We’ve got some mushrooms.  What do you want to do?”  And we’d all just talk about food.  Then we’d go and prep it up and do the menu.  Every day it changed, and it was great.  Some things were repetitive and we’d see them over and over again, but it was a lot of fun.  We got three stars in The New York Times.\n\nQ:  That’s serious.\n\nColicchio:  In New Jersey.  Yes, it was a great little restaurant.  It was a busy little restaurant too.  I mean just crazy busy.\nI eventually left and I took a job at a hotel in Secaucus, New Jersey, the Hilton Hotel in Secaucus.\n\nQ:  Where were you living when you were at these restaurants?  Were you living on your own?\n\nColicchio:  Yes, I was, actually.  When I was about eighteen, I moved out of my parents’ house and I took an apartment in East Orange, New Jersey, and that’s where I was living, with my girlfriend, actually.  We moved together.\n\nQ:  So you moved to the Hilton?\n\nColicchio:  We moved, yes.  The Hilton Hotel.  I was one of the youngest cooks in the kitchen, and within two weeks they give me the night chef’s position.  I was in charge of the kitchen at night.  The chef usually would go home around eight o’clock at night, the chef of the hotel.  He was busy with banquets and everything.  So my job, my real job was to run the gourmet restaurant.  There was a coffee shop.  But that was my position.  So there was a menu that I’d have to execute, and I was allowed to come up with specials on my own.  I did that.  A lot of it was I’d read books and try to do the dishes.  I’d read Frédy Girardet and Paul Bocuse and stuff like that.  I couldn’t do his dish.  I wasn’t really good enough, and so I knew I didn’t want this job.  I had to back and learn some more.  So I worked there for eight months or so.  I quit.  They offered me a lot more money.  I was like, “No, I can’t.  I’m leaving.”\n\tI stayed in touch with Jerry, who was the sous-chef at 40 Main Street.  He worked in New York for Leslie Revsin at Bridge Café, and he would always tell me, “You’ve got to go to New York.  You’ve got to get to New York.”\n\tSo after the Hilton, I was like, “All right.  It’s time to go.”\n\nQ:  Did you know what you needed to learn or wanted to learn?\n\nColicchio:  I’m wrong here, I think.  I’m wrong.  I went from Chestnut Tavern to the Hilton Hotel and then to 40 Main Street.  That was it.  That’s right.  Going 40 Main Street, and that’s when you started hearing New American cuisine.  That’s what we were doing.  That’s kind of what we were focusing on.\n\tSo from there, Jerry and another guy, Bill Rogers, who is now the chef at Keens in New York, they were like, “You’ve got to go to New York.”  So I got my résumé together and started making appointments.\nI remember Quilted Giraffe was a restaurant that was really high up for me.  I remember reading a bunch about it and what Barry was doing there, and it seemed very exciting and very different.\n\tBut Jams had just opened up, Jonathan Waxman’s restaurant, and I brought my résumé there and a few other places.  When I went to Jams, the chef was a woman who I was told to see, and she said, “We don’t have anything here, but my husband, Alfred, is opening up, is a chef at the restaurant, Gotham Bar and Grill.”  Back then it was called Gotham Bar and Grill, not the Gotham.  “Why don’t you go talk to him.”\nSo I went there and he hired me.  She didn’t say “my husband,” actually; she just said, “I know another guy.”  I found out later on when I became friendly with her, and Alfred’s a good friend of mine—they’re split up now—I put it all together. \n\nQ:  Did you realize that could be a big deal?\n\nColicchio:  No.  Again, I didn’t know a lot about New York restaurants, and at the time, it was great when you first started.  It was through the chef there before him, and the kitchen was in the middle of transitioning from one thing to another.\n\tI was there a week when I got a phone call Barry Wine saying, “I want to interview you.”  I went in for an interview, and it was kind of funny, like, Barry would have never hired someone like me, what he called a career cook.  He hired career changers, he hired college grads who thought it was a cool thing maybe to cook.  But as Barry told me later on, he had planned on opening a second restaurant.  He knew he had to sort of hire what he called a career cook, so I was the first experiment, which kind of backfired on him because I was there for four months and he gave me the sous-chef position.\n\tThere are a couple of standout things.  Wayne Nish worked there.  David Kinch, the restaurant in California.  But it was, I thought, a great restaurant.  Barry always got a hard time from a lot of chefs because he wasn’t a trained chef.  He was an attorney who left law, went up to New Paltz, opened a restaurant up in New Paltz, and then came to New York and did a version here.  Barry was always smart.  He always had a chef in the kitchen.  There was a chef before I got there, but when I was there, it was Noel Comess, who has now started Tom Cat Bakery after he left the restaurant.\nActually, it was very, very organized.  It ran like the clock.  Great thing about the restaurant, it was open Monday to Friday, so we were off Saturday and Sunday.  And no lunch.  Brilliant.  It was like working in France.  But the cool thing was, the same people were in the same position every day.  So it wasn’t like a seven-day operation where you got to bring other people in because you can’t work seven days a week and people are in different stations.  Waiters were in the same station every night.  Cooks were in the same station every night.  So the consistency was really amazing.\n\tI was there about a year, a little under a year, and Barry had the reputation if you ever left Barry, he wouldn’t talk to you anymore.  That was it.  So I remember going to Barry and telling him I was leaving.  The owner of 40 Main Street called me and offered me the chef position.  I said I’d only do it if my friend Jerry and I did it together, because we were at the time kind of looking to do a place together as co-chefs.  So Barry, I remember going in his office.  I said, “I’ve got to talk to you.”  And my car was just stolen in New York when I was working.\n\tHe goes, “Do you want to buy a car?  What do you need?”  I felt so bad because he was sincere.\n\tI was like, “No, Barr, I’m leaving.”\n\tAnd he was just like, “So, I can’t believe your leaving.”  But we stayed friends.\n\tI always said that, you know, I learned a lot about food there.  Barry had a farm, and talk about farm to table, he was doing this before the word “farm to table” was out there.  He had a farm in New Paltz, though.  He kept his property there, and the cooks would have to go up there and work the farm because he wanted them to see the connection between farm and the table.  So he was, I think, really ahead of his time.  He got a bad reputation for not being a chef at all, so he would go and travel and come back with dishes that he saw and put them on the menu.  Everyone else was doing the same thing, but he was honest about it.  He taught me how to run a restaurant.  You saw the way he and Susan, his wife, the way they ran their operation.  They were great operators.  They really were.\n\tAfter that, I went back to 40 Main Street, took the chef position there.  At this point I knew I wanted to be a chef.  Also, during the very beginning part of my career, my dad had brought me up to Culinary Institute, and you had to work in two restaurants before going up there, and so I started working with the idea that I was going to go to culinary school.  It wasn’t until I got the call to Giraffe and they gave me the sous-chef position—I think I was twenty, maybe—I knew I wasn’t going to school at that point.\n\tSo then 40 Main Street, I did that.  Part of the reason for going to New Jersey is I thought this would be a good way to sort of try to find a style out of New York, because I thought that was important.  I think when you look at what chefs were doing, especially some of the French chefs, I could look at dish and go, “That’s Paul Bocuse’s dish.  That’s the [unclear] dish.”  You’d see, “That’s Alain Chapel’s dish.”  You’d see the style, which was something that was a result of nouvelle cuisine, and that’s not what nouvelle cuisine gets credited for.  You think about different vegetables and cooking things less.  You think about different spices from world travel, things like that.  But the one thing that it did was, prior to that, everything was served on platters and Russian service to a table.  So this is the first time the chefs were actually putting a personality on a plate, and so this was the era of the chef.\nPeople think for some reason this was an American thing where chefs are on TV.  All the three-star chefs did this.  Paul Bocuse was famous, he had the famous line when he would travel around, he would say, “Who’s cooking in your kitchen when you’re not there?”  His response, “The same people who cook when I’m there.”  We all got a lot of mileage from that quote.\n\tSo back to 40 Main Street.  I did that for about eight months, and the problem was that there were two chefs and the owner, and I think the actual owners of the restaurant wanted one of us to go, and we both said, “We’re both going to leave together.”  And we did.\nSo I left 40 Main Street with the idea of I needed to go to France.  Arian Daguin, who has D’Artagnan, her dad owned a two-star Michelin hotel-restaurant in Gascony, Auch, and so I ended up going up for three months.\n\nQ:  Did it make you at all nervous to go from place to place?\n\nColicchio:  No.  For me, it was one year and that was it.\n\nQ:  Did you think in terms of the future?  Were you too young for that?\n\nColicchio:  No, I was thinking in terms of the future.  My feeling was, “I’ll work in a restaurant for a year and that’s it.  Then I’m moving on.”  My feeling is if you couldn’t see everything you need to see in a year, then what’s the point?\n\nQ:  Interesting.\n\nColicchio:  Now, meeting Alfred in such a short time, Alfred was—he wasn’t who he is now.  He was just starting out, and we’ll get to the story, he hired me back again later on.\n\nQ:  So you went to France?\n\nColicchio:  Well, let me think about this for second.  Is this where I went to France?  Yes, I think I did.  Maybe it was after.  No, not yet.  No.  After 40 Main Street, I ended up going to work at Gotham.  Now, this is a couple years later.  Alfred had a different reputation.  He hired me.  I remember going to the restaurant and having lunch, and he remembered me from when I was there.  I guess I’d run into him at events and stuff.  He hired me, not as a sous-chef, but—and it was the strangest thing too, because he was like, “I want you to come in and push my sous-chefs a little bit.”\n\tI was like, “This is a terrible job to have.”\n\nQ:  [laughs] What a job.\n\nColicchio:  Boy.  I was also at a very bad point in my life.  I had just broken up with a girlfriend who I was with for years, my childhood sweetheart.  You know, having your own restaurant where you call the shots and then going to work for somebody else, it’s hard to do.  So I had a bad, just a bad experience.  Not with him.  He was great.  But I was having a very hard time.  I was probably also living too much of the cook’s lifestyle sort of after-hours, if you know what I mean, which was not good.\n\nQ:  You mean partying?\n\nColicchio:  Yes, partying.  Yes, pretty hard.  So that didn’t last long.  I think I was there for about six months.  We just kind of sat down one day and we said, “You know what?  This isn’t working out.”\n\t“Yeah, it’s not working out.”\n\t“Okay, time to go.”  And then I went to France.  Came back.\n\nQ:  What did you do when you were in France?\n\nColicchio:  I’m there for about three months.  I worked in Gascony.  It was a great little job.  I don’t speak French.  I don’t speak a word of French. \n\nQ:  But you knew enough Italian to—\n\nColicchio:  No, I don’t speak Italian at all.  I know kitchen French to get by.\n\tYou’re way out in the country, but there was one guy in the kitchen who spoke pretty good English, and the chef, Barneau, the actual chef de cuisine, who was the son of the fighter, he spoke English too.  So there were enough people speaking English there.  And I knew how to cook.  A lot of these kids who were there really didn’t.  At this point, I could butcher really well.  I can work a line.  I knew what food was, and I knew how to cook.  So I actually started out doing a lot there.  In fact, I got to a certain point where when the chef went on vacation and the sous-chef took his position, I took the sous-chef position, which the other cooks in the kitchen were not happy about at all.  So I was there for about three months.\n\tThe other way I got by, too, was about a month into my stage, Kerry Heffernan, who is now the chef at South Gate, he showed up stage and spoke near fluent French and was American.  So he really helped out.  We became great friends and still very good friends to this day.\n\nQ:  So it was a stage.  Were you not paying anything?\n\nColicchio:  I wasn’t paying anything.  No.  I think there were tips that were collected for the back of house, a certain amount every night, and I think I got a cut of that.  But, no, I wasn’t paid.  I saved up money, and I lived in the hotel too.  The only thing I really had to pay for was drinks at the end of the night and if I decided to travel or go anywhere on my days off.\n\tSo I ended up working there for about three months, and I planned on going and working another three months in Paris.  I got into the middle of a family feud between Arnaud [Daguin] and André, the father, and André  turned around and told his son, “Fine, you take care of the America cooks in Paris,” meaning, “You get them jobs.”  The fight was over a woman.  It was silly.  So I found this out much later,\nWe get to Paris, Arnaud, he goes, “There’s nothing here for you.  I can’t get a job for you.”  We found out later on that Andre called everybody in Paris and said, “Don’t help my son out.”  [laughter]  I mean, it was that bad.  Arian told me this later on.  But it was one of those things. \n\tSo I ended up hanging in Paris for about a month until every dime I had ran out, and I started getting cash.  Somehow I figured out how to get cash on an American Express card until one day I walked in, they took the card away from me, and it’s like, “I’ve got to go home.”\n\tI ended up going home.  I remember it was the day before Thanksgiving when I got home and surprised everybody.\n\nQ:  And you were how old?\n\nColicchio:  Twenty-one, maybe, twenty-two, something like that.\n\tThen I got home and went to see Alfred, and he said, “Go talk to Chef—,” a guy I used to work with at the Polo, “Thomas Keller.  He’s opening a restaurant called Raquel.  It’s down on Clarkson and Carmine.  Go talk to him.”\n\tSo I went to Thomas and he wasn’t open yet.  He said, “I’m opening in about a month.  Come back and see me.”  So I went back to see him in a month, offered me a job as cook.  I think I was there about four or five months and the sous-chef left, and I took the sous-chef’s position there.  That was really eye-opening.  Everybody knows Thomas’ story and what he’s done and what he’s accomplished, but I think the one thing that most people don’t realize was back then he was very different.  The restaurant was never successful, and so the stress of not running a successful restaurant was hard.  His partner, Serge Raoul, ran Raoul’s, and I think wanted half the restaurant to be a club or a scene, downtown scene, and Thomas wanted a serious restaurant.  So that was very stressful, I think, for Thomas because the restaurant was very somewhat schizophrenic.\n\tBut the one thing that he did that was really interesting, in that kitchen the only thing we talked about was food.  So a lot of kitchens you walk in and you talk about the night before and movies, you talk about whatever it is.  You walked in and the discussion was, “This is what’s in the house today.  What are we working on?  Let’s talk food.”  It was only about food, only discussing what was going on for that service that night, who needed what, who needed help.  It was just very, very collaborative as well.  You were allowed to contribute.  He would always tweak whatever you did, and if it ended up on the menu, you felt good about it.\n\tI remember nights where I was working the fish side, he’s working meat side, and a VIP would come in, he would say, “Make a special kind of thing.  Just make something.”  Okay, you make something.  And then he would make something.  And he’d go, “Make something else.”  And this is going on and the other orders, you still have to take care of other orders and stuff.  It was great.\n\nQ:  Was it flattering or terrifying?\n\nColicchio:  Not terrifying.  It was flattering.  It was great.  Again, he wasn’t who he is now.\n\nQ:  But still tall.  [laughs]\n\nColicchio:  Oh, he’s still tall.  But it was never good enough for him.  That was one thing, push and push and push, which was great.  It just made everybody better.  But at the end of a busy night, he’s still pushing.  At the end of a busy night and you’re scrubbing the stove, every little—I mean, he was a fanatic about cleanliness, and it was just like, after a while it was like, “Come on.  How much do you want me to bleed?”\n\tHe’s like, “The answer is yes.”  But that was him and that’s why he’s successful.\n\tBut it was—encouraged to do things.  I remember there was a maître d’, Kenji, who didn’t work for us, but he was from California and worked for Wolfgang Puck, and he was coming to open a restaurant in town.  He came in for his birthday, and I remember Thomas wanted to serve foie gras.  There was like a party of ten.  I took a whole foie. I said, “How about if we throw the whole thing in the oven?”\n\tHe’s looking at me like, “What?”  He goes, “It better work.”\n\tI was like, “Eh, it should work.”  You know, roasted it, and it worked great.  But that was the kind of kitchen.  It was like you did anything.  I remember him standing up on a milk crate putting a plate on another milk crate on the floor, standing up and letting beet juice drizzle off it to splatter.  Like crazy—you know, anything, we did anything.\n\tWe felt so bad, I left the restaurant after about a year, and the restaurant never made it.  Chris Gesualdi was a sous-chef at the time there, and I don’t remember too many other people there, but we all felt we were doing something that was really special, and for some reason it just didn’t catch on.\n\tBut after Raquel, for a very short time I worked at China Grill, only because all the guys who were coming from California to open China Grill, they were good friends of my friend Jerry.  Because while I was doing all this, he went out to California and worked for Wolfgang Puck on Main.  So he came back, and I remember walking down the street after I left Raquel and running into one of the guys and saying, “We need help.  We don’t know New York at all.”  So I worked there for a couple weeks.\n\tThen at this point, my friend Jerry moved back to Virginia.  That’s where he was from.  He and his wife moved back, and so he got involved in this very large operation and he asked me to come down and help him for a couple months.  I ended up staying eight or nine months.\n\nQ:  What was that?\n\nColicchio:  This restaurant was ridiculous.  It was so big.  It was a club inside of it.  It was called The Max.  It was in Portsmouth, Virginia, sort of near Virginia Beach, but near Norfolk.  It had a breakfast area and this lunch business and dinner business with three different dining rooms.  It was just crazy over-the-top.  So I ended up helping him out, and I came back home.\n\tNow, coming back to New York, I had planned on going back to France.  I had a stage worked out to work with Alain Ducasse and Michel Bras.  It was during this time my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer, so I decided to stay close to home.\n\tAlso during this time I was reintroduced to Dennis Foy, who owned the Tarragon Tree and a restaurant, Toto, in New Jersey.  I’d met Dennis years before when I applied for a job and he kind of just looked at me and told me to leave the restaurant.  It was very competitive between Tarragon Tree and 40 Main Street.  They were a town apart, and a rivalry.  So when he saw I was at 40 Main Street, he had no time, after I had waited four hours.\n\tBut when I came back from France, before Raquel opened up, I helped him out in his restaurant, Toto, for a very short time during the holiday season.  So he was opening up Mondrian, this restaurant Mondrian in New York, and he came down to Virginia and said, “Hey, I’m opening this restaurant.  I would like to talk to you about coming on board.”\n\t“I’m going to France.  I’m not going to be around.”  But then my dad was diagnosed, so I decided to stick around.  So I called him up and said, “Let’s talk about this.”\nHe offered me a sous-chef position.  There was already another sous-chef that had worked with Dennis for a long time.  I got there, and a combination of my dad, who was clearly dying, there was no treatment for him at all, that and I didn’t like the way Dennis ran his kitchen.  His food was fine, but he’s ex-military guy.  I didn’t like it.  A lot of yelling, a lot of screaming.  So I decided it wasn’t for me, but I didn’t leave the restaurant yet.\n\tThen my dad passed away.  I took about a month off.  I came back and worked for a short time and said, “I can’t do this.”\n\tI ended up going to France, worked for Michel Bras.  I was there about two months when I got a phone call from the actual owner of Mondrian.  His name was Robert Scott.  A group of guys from Morgan Stanley actually owned the restaurant; they were backers in the restaurant.  So Bob said, “Why don’t you come back.  We want to talk to you about taking the chef’s position here.”\n\t“Okay.”\n\tCame back, and Dennis decided that New York wasn’t for him.  He was going to go back to New Jersey, and they offered me the chef’s job.  I was twenty-six.  Took the job, called my friend Kerry Heffernan, who I met in France, to come on and be a sous-chef, put a team together, and very shortly after that I got three stars in The New York Times.\n\nQ:  How did that make you feel?\n\nColicchio:  That was amazing.\n\nQ:  Did you realize how—you must have—how fast it was to accomplish something like that?\n\nColicchio:  To me it wasn’t fast.  I was eleven years in, so it wasn’t that fast.  It’s overnight success and you find out it really wasn’t overnight.  I was surprised at what it did.  I was surprised when Danny Boulud starting showing up to the restaurant, and Jean-Jacques Rachou.  These are guys who I had up on a pedestal.  Gerard Pangaud.  That’s when I first met Danny.  He started showing up, Danny Meyer.  So, all these people.  I actually met Danny years and years when I was at Quilted when he showed up to do a stage, and he looked like a twelve-year-old, and the rumor was he was opening this restaurant, Union Square Café, with the other guy, Ali Barker.\n\tWe were all laughing, “Oh, this guy’s gonna get eaten alive.”\n\tI remember Jonathan Waxman, who I went to interview at his restaurant, he started coming.  So all these people started coming in, and that I wasn’t ready for.  We were doing some great stuff there.  To this day, there are a lot of people who knew that restaurant when I mention it.  That was a special place.\n\nQ:  Was the food basically what’s called New American?\n\nColicchio:  I called it contemporary cooking, because for me, food, it doesn’t matter if you’re in Spain, you’re in France, you’re in Italy, wherever, contemporary food’s contemporary food.\n\nQ:  Could you explain what that meant to you in terms of the kinds of food you served?\n\nColicchio:  Well, for me what it meant was, I was trained in French cooking, grew up in an Italian household, didn’t want to do Italian food for whatever reason, but there was always that influence sort of there, you know, an Italian influence there.  But also what we were taught in American cooking was, the early sort of pioneers of American cooking, the food had a certain rusticity about it.  You think of Larry Forgione’s food.  These guys were breaking the ground for us.\n\tI think my generation of cooks started going to France, and we came back and we wanted to do food a little more polished but still distinctly America, but without that rusticity, but you’re still keeping a bit of a rustic edge.  It was just, again, trying to find my way.\n\tThe reason I wanted to go to Michel Bras is there was an article that Paul Woolford wrote about in him in New York Times Magazine and I saw the style.  I was like, “That’s what I’m looking for.”\n\tBut getting three stars, it just—and right around the same time I got Best New Chef from Food & Wine magazine.  And that was it.  It was just like, “Wow, I got a career.”  All these people that I looked up to now are my peers.  Then for me it was about just keeping it and just maintaining it.  I was afraid that it was all going to end somehow.  I was afraid that maybe someone would decide that food wasn’t important anymore and not care anymore.  So I just worked like a maniac. \n\tAt Mondrian, I was there every morning at ten o’clock.  I didn’t leave usually until twelve, one o’clock at night, lunch and dinner, prepped all afternoon with the crew, did the wine list, wine consultant.  I hired someone to do the wine list, didn’t like what he was doing.  I did the wine list, and I sold the private dining room.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Oh, my god.\n\nColicchio:  The problem with that restaurant, bad business deal.  These five guys from Morgan Stanley made a bad business deal.  [laughs]  Irony.\n\nQ:  Not the first or last time.  [laughs]\n\nColicchio:  No, and I’ll put it into perspective.  They opened an eighty-seat restaurant, they spent 3.2 million dollars, $36,000-a-month rent.  It was back in the late eighties, and we were going through a little recession there too. \n\tWhen I opened Gramercy [Tavern], 160 seats, 3 million dollars to build it, $9,000-a-month rent.  So in ’91, through my best new chef, Mike Romano, Chef of the Year, [James Beard Award, 1997, for Outstanding Restaurant of the Year] [Union Square] Café gets the award and at the same time I met Danny.  I met him in the restaurant, but now I spent a little more time with him in Aspen at the Food and Wine Festival.  The following year, went back to Aspen, I had a lunch with him and I knew that my restaurant was probably—I was going to close it.\n\tI got to a certain point where the restaurant seemed like it was successful, but every month the guys would write a check.  I finally said, “This is not success to me.  This doesn’t feel right, and I think we should close the restaurant.”\n\tI remember they had a big meeting and they came back and they said, “Well, we’re going to throw a half million dollars into the restaurant.  What would you do to change it?”\n\tI said, “Guys, don’t do it.”  I said, “If you want to do that, my concern is that we owe suppliers.”  I think we owed about $100,000 in payables.  Wine, I knew I could send back to the suppliers.  I got everybody together.  I said, “How much is it going to cost to go bankrupt?”\n\tThe attorney said, “About $100,000 for Chapter 11.”\n\tI said, “Fine.  Give me that money.”  What I did was, actually I said, “Give me $50,000,” and I paid everybody 50 cents on a dollar.  I called all my suppliers up.  I said, “We’re going out of business.  I’ll give you 50 cents on a dollar, cash, tomorrow.”  If we go Chapter 11, they have to wait years for that to work through the courts.  Maybe they get 10 cents on a dollar.  I said, “I’ll give you cash tomorrow.”\n\nQ:  There were many people who run restaurants who wouldn’t have bothered doing that.  What made you realize it’s really important?\n\nColicchio:  I had a great relationship with all my suppliers.  I knew back then that raw ingredients, especially after working in France, that that was the key.  You know, you’ve got to get great ingredients.  I mean, coming from Michel Bras and going to Greenmarket and finding all the stuff there, bringing back seeds and saying, “Will you grow this for me?”  And they did.  So, to me, that relationship was so important, and I knew that I was going to land on my feet, and I didn’t want to [unclear].\n\tEverybody but one person said, “Wow.  This is amazing.  No one ever does this.  They usually just walk away.”  One person gave me a hard time, and I vowed I’d never buy from the guy, and I never have.  Every time I get a call from a salesperson, I say, “Go talk to your boss and ask him why I won’t buy.”\n\tSo July ’92, I know the restaurant’s going to close.  I have lunch with Danny.  I come back the following week, come back to New York, called him up.  I said, “I’m closing the restaurant tomorrow.”  And I knew he was a fan of the restaurant.  He keeps coming all the time.  I said, “I have a sense that maybe you want to do a second restaurant.  Why don’t we talk about doing it together.”\n\tHe said, “No, I really don’t want to do a second restaurant.  I’m busy now.”  \tAbout a week later, he called me up and said, “You know what?  Let’s explore this.”  He told me that he spoke to a wine supplier who I worked with named Robert Chadderdon, and Robert Chadderdon used to come into Mondrian a lot.  He said—it was a baseball metaphor he used, and I think it was “If—,” I don’t know who they used.  It wasn’t Derek Jeter, but, “If Derek Jeter called you up and said, ‘Let’s start a baseball team,’ you’d say yes to that.”  Something along those lines.\nSo Danny and I got together.  We talked a little bit.  You know, we never discussed food or wine.  I knew what he was capable of service-wise from going to Union Square Café.  We talked about what we wanted from the industry, what we wanted from business, and how we want to run a business.  So we got to a certain point, we decided to travel together.  We figure if we could travel together, we could probably work together.  So we took a trip to Italy.  Great trip.  Danny spent summers in Italy or France with his father’s travel business and so he knew a lot of people there, spoke the language, and so we had a great trip.\nCame back.  On the plane ride home, we sketched out the idea for Gramercy Tavern, talked about—\n\nQ:  Can you remember what those ideas were?\n\nColicchio:  We talked about doing a restaurant that was about American food, but something that’s more polished.  What American food was, we wanted to push it a little further.  The idea of service being correct but not stuffy, a little more correct than it was at Union Square Café, a little more polish, but not stuffy.\nTalked about a place.  We talked about this idea of taverns, idea of a place where you come for respite where usually you find them, you know, on the road going from one town to the other, and this place where you actually stayed, and it was the only dining room.  It was a place where also politics were discussed of the day, and things like that.  So that was the sort of sense of community that we wanted in the restaurant and how that restaurant fit into the greater community of New York.  We talked about a lot of stuff like that and talked about what we wanted to accomplish. \n\tSo it took about six months to find a location.  I remember walking down the street.  I was actually going to look at another space with a broker, and I remember walking past the space and the windows were boarded up.  So you have four windows boarded up, graffiti all over the front of the building, and I look at it, and I always remember Aureole uptown and those big windows.  Every night you’d look in there, it looked like a party was going on and you weren’t invited because you were outside.  So the idea of these windows, there was something about it.\nSo we looked at the space, and the owner of the building, his office was upstairs on the third floor or something, and he only wanted to give us half the space.  Danny was like, “No, we need the whole thing.”  We played hardball and talked him into it, got a great rent, and then went about building the restaurant.\n\nQ:  At that point you really knew the downsides of what it was like to own and run a restaurant.  I mean you knew everything that would have been involved.\n\nColicchio:  Well, I didn’t own the other one.  I knew that restaurants fail, can fail.\n\nQ:  But you knew the perils.\n\nColicchio:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So were you scared?\n\nColicchio:  No.\n\nQ:  And why was that?  Did you have to put up money?\n\nColicchio:  I did.  I don’t live life afraid.  I just don’t.  Robert Scott, who I mentioned earlier, when we closed Mondrian, I said, “Listen, I’ll do another restaurant together if you want to stay in the business.”  He loved the restaurant business.  He went to graduate school at Stanford and spent a lot of time in the Bay Area and really enjoyed food.  So I said, “Listen, I’ll talk to Danny Meyer and you should meet him and we’ll do something together.”\n\tNow, what Bob did, Bob is not the kind of guy to just say, “Here’s money.”  But what he did was really interesting.  He guaranteed a loan.  So he went to his bank, he guaranteed the loan, I had to sign for it, and I had to pay back that loan.  So I invested money in Gramercy Tavern.\n\nQ:  Did it seem like a fortune?  I don’t know whether you want to tell me, but—\n\nColicchio:  No, it wasn’t a fortune.  It was a good amount of money to pay back, I want to say $300,000, something like that.\n\nQ:  Oh, imaginable.\n\nColicchio:  Yes.  Well, back sixteen, seventeen years ago.\n\nQ:  Still.\n\nColicchio:  Yes.  So we were going to build the restaurant and design the restaurant.  That was a great experience.  Danny and I would go to antique shows, Connecticut and the [unclear] show in New York, and source stuff.  We had these two guys who were helping us source antiques and artwork.  It was a great process, and I think part of it was we kind of took our time with it.\n\tWe also had children at the same time.  I think they were born almost a month apart.  The great thing was I got to stay home for almost the first year and a half of my son’s life.  My wife was working, or his mother was working, I should say.  So that was neat.  But building this thing and opening, it was a great experience.  But then it wasn’t so great.\n\tWhen we first opened that restaurant, it was okay, got two stars in The New York Times.  I thought we deserved one, based on what I knew I was capable of doing at Mondrian.  I looked at Mondrian versus what we were doing there.  Different reviewers.  Bryan Miller gave me three stars at Mondrian.  Ruth Reichl gave us two, came back a year later and gave us three.  When she gave us a three, we deserved it.  It was night and day, the restaurant, partly because we were doing numbers, and I knew this restaurant was a lot bigger than Mondrian, so I kind of dumbed-down my food because I was afraid of the numbers that we were going to do.\n\nQ:  Dumbed-down in what respect?\n\nColicchio:  I just made it simpler and made it easier to produce, maybe start cooking a little more in advance and things like that.  I remember at one point going to Danny, and he brought in a general manager and a partner, I remember going to them and saying, “You know what?  We’ve got to make some changes here.”\n\tThey said, “What do you have in mind?”\n\tI said, “Well, we’re doing about 240 covers a night.  I don’t want to do that anymore.  I want to do about 180.”\n\tThey looked at me like, “Are you crazy?  You know how much money we’re going to lose?”\n\tI said, “Guys, trust me on this one.  I want to do a tasting menu.  In fact, I want to do two tasting menus.  I want to do better food.  The waiters will have more time at the table.  And I guarantee you if we drop those covers, check average will go up and we’ll make more money.”\n\tAnd they said, “Fine.”\n\nQ:  That’s a big vote of confidence.\n\nColicchio:  Well, I was the managing partner of the restaurant too.  [laughs]  So I was kind of like, “Guys, this is what I need to do.  This isn’t working.  It’s only going to get worse from here.”\n\nQ:  And were you cooking at all?\n\nColicchio:  Oh, yes, I was in the kitchen.  Yes, I was there all the time.  Well, I say cooking.  Chefs don’t typically cook; cooks cook.  But I was in the kitchen night and day.  In fact, I would do the stay at the end of service, twelve o’clock at night.  We had a private dining room about the size of this room here, and that’s where the waiters would check out at the end of the night and do all their paperwork and stuff.  I would sit in there with them.  Back then you could smoke cigars in a restaurant, so I’d sit there and smoke a cigar sometimes and drink whatever I would drink at the end of the night.  And we would have meetings, but very informal.  They didn’t realize it was a meeting.  They’d start talking about the night.  I’d listen to them rant and rave about whatever, and I’d come in the following morning and go, “Oh, I think we should do this, this and this.  And this happened.”\n\tAnd everybody, “Where you getting all this stuff from?”\n\tI’m like, “Well, we have meetings at one o’clock in the morning.  I’m not sure you guys are, but that’s how we’re running this thing.”  So anyway, we cut back.\nI remember it was also right around the time of the [James] Beard Awards.  I knew a lot of people were going to come in town because we’re the new restaurant, and I wanted this thing to just change, and it did.  We also had everything right.  Claudia Fleming was just coming into her own in pastry.  Paul Greico, who now has Hearth, and Tara Weinbar was running service and wine.  Nick Mautone was our general manager.  Things just really started gelling and came together.\nBut it was work.  You know, this was every single day just pushing and pushing and pushing.  So getting that third star by Ruth was just great.  It really just kind of pushed that restaurant into a different place than where it started, because when we started that restaurant, the week before we opened, there was a cover of New York Magazine that said, “Is this the next four-star restaurant?”\n\nQ:  Oh, my.  Terrifying.\n\nColicchio:  I mean, the stakes were so high.  It was really tough.  And, you know, it wasn’t close.  Ruth came back a year later, it was close.  In fact, in her review she said, “This restaurant is just a touch away from your four-star restaurant,” which we never wanted it to be, but it was good.  It was very, very good.  So, happy doing that.\n\nQ:  The idea in the front of no reservations, was that common at that point in the city?\n\nColicchio:  No.\n\nQ:  That seemed like a great idea.\n\nColicchio:  A couple things about the front of that restaurant.  The reason why the front dining room was different was because there would have been way too many seats for me to handle doing the food that I wanted to do, so we decided to separate it and do a smaller restaurant in back and in front.  The reason we didn’t take reservations in the front, we thought it would be too confusing.  People would call for a reservation, we’d say, “Front or the back?”\n\tAnd they, “Well, what do you mean by that?”\n\tSo we just kept the front for walk-ins.  So it was just by necessity; it wasn’t by design at all.\n\nQ:  But it was a really good idea.\n\nColicchio:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Is that the way this is going—\n\nColicchio:  We take reservations up front.  Since then, we figured out a way to do it.  People know it’s different.  The reason being here, also, is we’re so far west, people aren’t going to venture here if they don’t have a reservation.  There’s not enough neighborhood people to fill the seats right now, so we have to take reservations up front.\n\nQ:  We’ll get to it, but what made you build here?\n\nColicchio:  Yes, we’ll get there.\n\nQ:  Okay.  All right.\n\nColicchio:  So after six, seven, eight years, whatever it was, I remember walking with Danny over to look at a space that he was looking at for Michael Amato to do an Indian restaurant, and it was on the north side of Madison Square Park.  I remember walking over there and looking at the space and just saying, “Dan, this is a tough space.”  I remember walking back and pointing to where Eleven Madison and Tabla is now and saying, “This would make a pretty interesting restaurant.”\n\tHe said, “Well, it’s available.”\n\tI was like, “Well, let’s take a look at it.”  So we looked at it and decided to go ahead, and Danny made a deal with the owners of the building, MetLife.\n\tI was involved to a certain point with Eleven Madison and Tabla and decided that I didn’t want to be part of the group.  The ownership was different.  The ownership of Union Square was different than the ownership of Gramercy, and Gramercy was going to be different than the ownership of the other restaurants, and I just didn’t want to be part of it.\n\tDuring this time, right after that, probably because I wanted autonomy to do my own thing still, I mean, Gramercy was my own thing.  I did it with Danny.  That was great, but I wanted my autonomy to do something different where I didn’t have someone sort of telling me when I can and when I can’t do something, or trying to tell me.  So I opted out of the group.\nIt was a year or so later when I was approached by a guy on the coop board of the building where Craft is now, and he wanted to know about garbage and pest control and things like that, and I asked him why.  He said, “Well, we have this building on the corner and we are negotiating for a restaurant tenant, and I just want to talk to you about this stuff.”  So I asked if I could see the space.  He said, “Well, we’re in lease negotiation so we’re going to sign a lease.”  Okay.\n\tCouple months go by.  I walk by the building, nothing’s happening.  I call the guy back and said, “What’s going on?”\n\tHe said, “Well, it fell through.  Let’s talk.”  So we start negotiating, got it up and created a deal, and that’s how Craft started.\n\nQ:  And your idea for Craft at that point was?\n\nColicchio:  Well, the idea was that I was doing my food at Gramercy Tavern, and I knew didn’t want to do an ethnic restaurant or something like that.  I had to do something different.  I couldn’t do the same.  My plan was always to stay at Gramercy; it wasn’t to leave.  In fact, I had a deal to buy Danny out, and at the last second just said, “This is what I want.”\n\tI thought about where I thought the food world was going.  Everybody was talking about simplicity and there was a lot of talk about ingredients and product.  So I thought, okay, if you really want to highlight great ingredients, let’s just highlight the great ingredients.  What is wrong with serving a bowlful of peas?  That’s it.  A little butter, that’s it.  What’s wrong with serving a plate of morels when they’re first in season, or a plate of wraps or asparagus?  And why do you got to mix things?  So partly because I didn’t want to do what I was doing at Gramercy, I didn’t want to just do different dishes, so I was like, “Hmm.  This could work out nicely.”\n\tNow, also, right around this time was the James Beard Awards, and I remember we used to have this little sort of private party after the awards and I would invite some chefs back to my restaurant right after the awards, and then we’d go to parties after that.  I remember this group of, like, twenty of us coming back to the restaurant, and I called John Schaefer, who was the chef of cuisine at Gramercy at this point.  I said, “I want some baby lamb.  Just put some thyme, olive oil on platters on the table.  I want a bowl full of morels.  I know we have some asparagus just came in.  That, and that’s what I want.  Don’t mix together.  I want it on platters.”\n\tI remember sitting down and it start happening and it was great.  People were passing food around.  And it was like, “Wow.  This is different.”  I always remember that.  I said, you know, this is, I think, something missing from a lot of New Yorkers’ lives, the idea of passing food around, because we’re not eating at home, we’re eating out too much, and if you’re already home, it’s takeout.  So this can work out nicely.\n\tSo that’s how Craft came about.  The name came about because to me this was about the craft of cooking, not so much the artistry of cooking.  It was about just really focusing on those individual ingredients and saying you can take a piece of fish, roast it, some herbs, olive oil, put it on a plate and leave it alone.  That’s it.  And that’s what we did.\n\nQ:  Was that difficult to sell?\n\nColicchio:  To sell to—\n\nQ:  Diners.\n\nColicchio:  Not as hard as I thought it was going to be.  What was difficult was the first menu was a little complicated because there was sauces and there was condiments, and I got rid of that within the first week.  Funny thing was, everybody had a very difficult time when it first opened up ordering, trying to figure it out.  Some people didn’t; some people did.  But we opened up the exact same restaurant, pretty much the same restaurant, only we called it Craftsteak in Las Vegas, and no one had a problem figuring it out.  So it’s just how you kind of package it.  A lot of people thought—and I think the press actually misrepresented it as well—that you were going to order these ingredients, these disparate ingredients, you were going to order them and then we were going to plate them together on a plate.  And it’s kind of like, “How do I know this goes with that?”  It’s like, “No, that’s not going to happen.”  And I would always say it grows together, it goes together, so seasonal food always has an affinity for each other.\nBut after a while, people got used to it.  I think also it got very complicated when the waiters would try to explain it.  So finally I remember listening to some waiter explain it and this glazed-over look that these customers had on.  I was like, “Stop explaining it.  Just put the menu down.  If they have questions, they’ll ask.  If not, then tell them.”  But we were doing something right.  Bill Grimes, three stars.  So this is my third restaurant, third different reviewer, third three-star review.  We hit a home run.\n\nQ:  I wasn’t living here, but I came up as often as I could, and I remember going there and thinking the people that I knew who went there, the women were very nervous because the women were used to presenting a sort of full plate at home.  The guys, it was perfectly normal.  It was like they could order a steakhouse menu, and so it was no problem.  I just found it interesting.\n\nColicchio:  This is why men won’t ask for directions and women need directions.  [laughter]  But the funny thing was, I, like a lot of other Italian American chefs from my generation, we all stayed away from Italian food.  Alfred Portale, Tom Valenti all kind of stayed away from Italian food because we were trained in French food and it was a fancier food, whatever.  At a certain point, I looked at what we were doing at Craft and said, “This is Italian.”  This is Italian the way you eat in Italy, not what’s known as Italian restaurants here.  It was funny, because Sergio Macchione’s wife came in for her birthday about two or three weeks after we opened up and she pulled me aside, she goes, “This is the best Italian restaurant in the city.”\n\tI looked at her and said, “Don’t tell people that.”  [laughter]  I wish I had told people that it was Italian, although I don’t know if people would recognize that it’s Italian.\n\nQ:  No.\n\nColicchio:  Never.  But it’s such in the spirit of Italian eating, where one thing and that’s it.\n\nQ:  That’s why Italian food is so good.  I mean real Italian food.\n\nColicchio:  Yes.  But I thought if I called it Italian food, no one would get it.  I think if I tried try to explain it in the spirit of the simplicity, then people would have been confused.\nWe just had our tenth anniversary at Craft, and I brought back some chef notables, cooks and chefs who worked in the kitchen.  So it was Marco Canora, who was the first chef in the restaurant; Jonathan Benno, who was a cook there; David Chang, who started answering phones at Craft and then we [unclear]…him down in the kitchen; Akhtar Nawab; Karen Demasco; and then the three chefs who are currently in my restaurants in New York, James Tracey, Damon Wise, and Lauren Hirschberg.\n\nQ:  Let me ask you two things.  I realize that the time is an issue here.\n\nColicchio:  I got to get to a seder tonight.  That’s all.\n\nQ:  [laughs] Oh, I see.\n\nColicchio:  Well, actually, I’ve got to go home and get the kids packed up into the car so my wife [Lori Silverbush] can go to Brooklyn, and I’m going to take a cab later on and meet here there.\n\nQ:  Do you do two seders?\n\nColicchio:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nColicchio:  Because her parents are divorced.\n\nQ:  At what point did you write Think Like a Chef?\n\nColicchio:  Think Like a Chef, god, that was—\n\nQ:  Because it was published in 2000.\n\nColicchio:  I was still at Gramercy.  And interesting, I didn’t want to write The Gramercy Tavern Cookbook because I didn’t think we were old enough to do that yet.  Think Like a Chef came about because I’d been asked to do cookbooks.  I kept saying, “No, I don’t want to do a cookbook,” because I didn’t want to just have a bunch of recipes and say, “Here’s the recipes.”  I wanted to try to teach someone something different or something at least the way I was comfortable cooking food.  So it was an interesting process writing that book because I kind of started out in a very different direction.  There was a different writer who was a waiter at the restaurant, who was a very, very smart guy, and I was sure he turned in some great papers at school but he wasn’t a writer.\n\nQ:  It’s a fantastic book.\n\nColicchio:  Well, we did everything at home, and my wife’s a writer and she would kind of listen to what we were doing with one ear.  She’s a screenwriter, so she understands story.  So once the manuscript was turned in, she read it and goes, “There’s no way we’re turning this in.”  And within two weeks she wrote the book, just completely rewrote it.\n\nQ:  She reorganized it into the—\n\nColicchio:  No, I did that.  The components?\n\nQ:  Why don’t you explain that.\n\nColicchio:  Well, for me, again, I was trying to figure out ways to teach people about food, and so obviously if you’re going to talk about techniques, you start with techniques.  But I wanted to boil it down to make it really simple and something that you could understand: roasting, braising, sautéing, poaching, how to cook green vegetables, how to do certain things.  So this was the building blocks.  Then from there, I wanted to give the reader a jumping-off point to create their own food, do their own thing.  The idea of going to a market, having the ability to walk into a Greenmarket or whatever and just buy stuff, and knowing that when you come home you’ll figure a way to make it all work, versus the recipe in hand and, “Oh, god, they don’t have this.  What do I do?”\n\tSo I stumbled upon this idea of trilogies, where we take three ingredients and work them together in very different ways to teach people how to create.  Then we look at a dish that you’re doing, lamb, fennel, eggplant, tomato, whatever.  You know it’s all going to go together.  It’s all seasonal.  It all kind of makes sense.  It sounds right.  But the question is, how do you get that stuff in there?  The lamb, is it braised?  Is it roasted?  Well, that all depends on the cut.  The fennel, do you want to roast it?  Do you want to sauté it?  Do you want it braised?  Do you want it cool like a salad?  Do you want to actually make it all together and make a big ragu?  How do you want to do the eggplant?\n\tSo the question is how, not so much what, and that’s something that the trilogies teach, because you take these ingredients and you manipulate them in different ways to come up with different dishes.  So three chapters of that.\nThis is something I used to talk to Barry Wine about, and he was talking about, which was component cooking, because that’s all you do is move components around the board to create the dishes.  But also this idea of ingredients.  What is an ingredient?  You make a roasted tomato.  So now there’s a recipe to do that, but now that’s the ingredient in a dish.  And that was actually something I’d written for Food & Wine magazine.  I did this tomato piece for them a couple years before that and talked about just the roasted tomato, not as an ingredient.  But now when I made it into this book, that became an ingredient, and then from there, so, okay, now you have the ingredient.  What do you do with it?  How do you create dishes starting with the ingredient outward?\n\tSo these themes, as I thought about what I was doing, they presented themselves.  Then once you hit on the tomato theme, it’s like, what other theme can you use?  Oh, it’s the mushroom theme.  Then what else?  So the trilogies, it was throw three ingredients together and let’s see how we can push them and pull them.  So the duck and root vegetable, apple became one.  The ranch asparagus morel, I think, became another.\n\nQ:  I reread it recently, obviously, and I was really impressed with the clarity of the explanation of the techniques.  That alone would have been enormously helpful to people, I think.\n\nColicchio:  My favorite cookbooks are Elizabeth David’s.\n\nQ:  With no instructions.\n\nColicchio:  Exactly.  And why?  The assumption was if you’re buying a cookbook, you knew had to cook.  [laughs]  So you can say, “Take a shoulder of lamb, bone it out removing all the fat, tie it up,” and show you how to tie it, “and then you brown it off and you take your carrot, your celery, onion, leek, cut into quarter-inch pieces, brown them off, put it together, add stock, braise the lamb shoulder.”  That’s all that’s said is, “Braise the lamb shoulder,” so the assumption was you knew how to braise a lamb shoulder.\nSo for me it was like let’s break this down and make it as simple as possible and get rid of all the fluff.  I’d have these problems when I worked with an editor in a magazine and I’d give a recipe and say, “No, you’ve got to be much more detailed than this.”  Why?  It just clouds it up.  Just keep it really clear and to the point, I think it’s easier.\n\nQ:  Because readers panic.\n\nColicchio:  Yes.  You know, it’s funny.  I tie flies.  Just before I came over here, I was reading this magazine that I got.  I don’t need to read—tie flying for me is like recipes.  I don’t read the recipe.  I look at a picture and go, “Okay, I know how to do it.”  I know the technique, so I know how to apply materials to the hook and I know whether it’s fresh water or salt water because it’s all technique.  You learn how to put wings on if you’re tying trout flies.  There’s various flies and you learn how to tie them.  These are the basics.  Then from there, you make your own patterns and your own thing.  Same thing with cooking.\n\tBut I’m looking at this recipe for this fly and it is so complicated.  It is just crazy complicated to what he’s trying, and the fly’s a fairly simple fly.  But to make it where the particular string or feathers don’t get wrapped around the hook, which is a problem, you have to create this base underneath it.  It would have been the easiest thing to give us three photos, and yet it was ten paragraphs of nonsense.  I was reading this, going, “This is so much easier.”\nSo for me, I think cooking, basic cooking, not some of the stuff that’s going on today, which is much more complicated, it is easy and it should be easy.  It doesn’t need to be overly complicated.  I mean, look at a recipe for making a consommé, how complicated it seems.  When you actually do it, it’s like, “Oh, this is it?”  Take some egg whites and some mirepoix and whip it up and put it in stock and just stir it until it comes to the top and let it simmer.  That’s it?  Really?  But yet you read that recipe.\n\nQ:  It’s scary.\n\nColicchio:  Oh, god.  You never want to do it.\n\nQ:  You mentioned writing for magazines.  Had you done enough of that before you did Think Like a Chef so that you felt that you could write a book?\n\nColicchio:  I’d written a few articles.  My wife and I did an article on bay scallops for Saveur.  We did the article together on tomatoes.\n\nQ:  Were editors calling and asking?\n\nColicchio:  Yes, a few would call and say, “Think about doing a book.”\n\nQ:  No, I meant actually for the articles first.\n\nColicchio:  Oh, no.  We would pitch them.  Yes, we would pitch them.  It’s a pretty easy thing to actually do, I guess.  I wish my wife would do more of it.  She doesn’t want to.  In fact, she used to have arguments, “I don’t want to be known as known as a food writer.  I’m a screenwriter.  I’m a director.  I’m a film director.”  I was like, “Use a different name then.”\n\nQ:  She’s right.\n\nColicchio:  Yes.  She won’t even pitch now.  I said, “Well, fine.  We’ll just use a fictitious name and it’ll be fine.”  No.  Won’t do that.\n\tSo, yes, that book, when it came out, it won a Beard Award, which was pretty exciting.  But for me was when I started getting calls from people in cooking schools saying, “We’re trying to use this as a text,” as a teaching book.  That’s pretty cool.\n\nQ:  That’s thrilling.\n\nColicchio:  Yes, it really was.  And I think the second book, The Craft of Cooking, we didn’t put as much effort into the book.  I think it shows.  It’s a good book, but it’s not Think Like a Chef.  I don’t want to say I mailed it in, but we were just trying to capture a moment in time in the restaurant, and so the recipes were very different.  It was a very different book.  It wasn’t meant to be a sequel to Think Like a Chef.  It was really meant to just sort of capture this moment of a restaurant without it being this big over-produced restaurant cookbook.\n\nQ:  When did you have time to do these things?\n\nColicchio:  You find time.  You make time.  For me it’s about having a good team around me sort of forcing me, “Okay, Tom, this is what you have to do today.  You’ve got to get this thing done.”  I’ve owed a new book to my editors for a year now and I haven’t started yet.  But I finally know what I’m doing.  [laughs]  It took a while.\n\nQ:  So you had to figure out what you wanted to say?\n\nColicchio:  Yes.  I thought I was going to do a book based on the Tuesday Dinners, like a big coffee table, over-the-top photo kind of book.  I started looking at those recipes and they were impossible.  I don’t use recipes.  I’d look at a particular dish that I was putting together and just go, “This is way too complicated.”\n\tThen I was thinking of doing a butchering book.  Got very complicated.  Then I hit on something that I think is going to be actually pretty neat.  My son’s turning eighteen and he loves food, has no idea how to cook.  He’s my son.  He should.  His friends all assume he knows how to cook, and I think he actually plays up like he knows how, but he really doesn’t.  So I’m going to teach him.\n\nQ:  It must be pretty intimidating.\n\nColicchio:  No, I don’t think so.\n\nQ:  Really?\n\nColicchio:  No, because I cook at home and it’s very simple stuff.  So this summer I’m going to teach him how to cook, and we’re writing a book together.  He’s writing it too.\n\nQ:  Oh, what a great idea.\n\nColicchio:  It’s going to be stuff I cook at home without it being “Chef cooks at home,” which we need another “Chef cooks at home” book.  He’s eighteen in two days, three days, twenty-first.  Two days.  And our relationship has changed.  He’s a young adult now and he’s not a kid anymore.  He’s away at boarding school, so I don’t see him as much.  With these two babies at home, it’s like we need to reconnect, and so we’re going to reconnect over food.  For me teaching him, it’s more about a life skill.  I doubt he’ll ever work professionally in a kitchen.  So I think this is more life skill, more sort of a way he can cook for himself, for his friends, family later on in life when he has his own family, and just kind of understand food a little better.  So it should be fun.  But I’m making him write the book too.  He’s got to do a little work here.\n\nQ:  I think we should stop now.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tColicchio - 1 -  PAGE 51\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Tom Colicchio\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #2\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t           New York City\n\nDate:  May 12, 2011\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is May 12, 2011, and I’m with Tom Colicchio at his restaurant Colicchio & Sons off the High Line in New York City. \nHi there.\n\nColicchio:  How are you doing?\n\nQ:  Before we move on to the Gramercy Tavern/craft period, I wondered if we could talk about the Gramercy Tavern and how you shaped it, how and why it was set up the way it was, and did it work the way that you wanted it to.\n\nColicchio:  It definitely worked the way we wanted it to.  You know, the space was quite large; it was 10,000 square feet.  We knew we had to have a kitchen on the ground floor and then a prep kitchen in the basement.  Our offices were in the basement.  But upstairs when we saw the space, it was a pretty wide-open space.  There were some columns in there, and I think coming out of the—\n\nQ:  Structural columns.\n\nColicchio:  Yes.  Coming out of the eighties where there were a lot of these large restaurants, there were sort of big open spaces like Gotham and places like that.  We wanted a large restaurant.  Obviously, the economics of running a large restaurant is better than a small restaurant, but we still wanted the restaurant to feel intimate, and so what we actually did was counterintuitive to what you would normally do.  We added different columns to the space, because we wanted to create these corners and these places of intimacy.\nSo if you look at Gramercy, there are four different dining areas, actually five including the private dining room.  There’s a bar area, which we separated from the main restaurant.  Then in the dining rooms there are three smaller dining rooms that compose the dining room.  So there’s the main room when you first walk in, and then there’s another small room off to the left, and then there’s a room in the back.  The way we broke them all up was there are different ceiling designs in each one.  One is a barrel vault, one has a coffered ceiling, and one is just, I think, open beams.\nSo the idea was to create these episodes, and so the idea is that you walk into the restaurant and the restaurant would unveil itself to you slowly, as opposed you walk in and you see the whole thing.  It also gave us the opportunity for a lot of corners.  People like dining in corners, so it gave us a lot of opportunity for corners, a lot of great wall space for artwork and stuff like that. \n\tBecause we knew early on, I mean Danny and I had talked about what the next sort of iconic Americana establishment that we can sort of modernize, so he had Union Square Café, there was also Gotham Bar and Grill, which wasn’t a bar and grill, but still it was an updated version.  Just like Union Square [Café] wasn’t sort of typical of what a café would be; it was a more updated version of that.  So we thought about what was the next thing, and we stumbled upon tavern and the idea of the tavern being a place—usually it was just a place to eat in town, or along the road going from one town to the next town you’d find a tavern.  Sometimes they had rooms, sometimes they didn’t, but it was usually a hub for the community, and so we wanted to create that kind of atmosphere.\n\tThe restaurant itself was such a large space, I was very concerned with having 250 seats in a dining room, and so that’s why we broke it up to a tavern or front room and then a dining room, with the idea that we would do a separate menu in the front and the back.  Then we had enough room to put a grill, so everything was cooked off a wood-burning grill for the front room only, and that made the menus completely different.\nWe wanted that tavern part of the restaurant to be a relatively inexpensive experience and also an experience that we were only doing walk-ins, we weren’t taking reservations, because we wanted to have that sense of community where if you were in a neighborhood, you could just drop in and get a table.\n\nQ:  Was there any other really upscale dining establishment at that point that had done that?\n\nColicchio:  Well, yes, there was.  Chez Panisse had the upstairs that was casual and downstairs was fine dining.\n\nQ:  But that’s far away.\n\nColicchio:  Well, yes, but we knew of that restaurant.  It wasn’t that we didn’t know about that restaurant.  In the city, I’m not sure.\n\tAgain, the space that we found really dictated what we were going to do.  Again, because the space was so large, I was nervous doing that many seats, and so that’s why we decided to do the front room and it became the tavern.  That was the tavern part of the room, the big bar.  Then, you know, we got lucky where Danny [Meyer] had a friend who was an artist, Bob Kushner, who provided that incredible mural for us.  It’s not Bob.  I’m blanking on his name.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  Robert Kushner.\n\nColicchio:  Yes, who provided this incredible mural for us at such a great price because we couldn’t afford it.  He’s a fairly well known artist, so that was a nice favor, and that really, I think, set the tone.  Again, both of us, I think Danny and I both sort of felt that if we brought somebody in like Kushner to create this mural, that it wasn’t about telling him what to do; it was like, “This is what we’re doing in the restaurant.  What do you think would work here?”  And he created the mural.  It’s just beautiful, and I think that really set the tone.\n\tWe had this idea of early American, but, again, modernizing it, and so we went shopping for antiques at all the antique shows, because we wanted it to feel authentic.  We didn’t want to do Pottery Barn Americana.  We really wanted it to be authentic, and so we spent way too much money buying those things, and they had no business being in a restaurant, but they held up pretty well.\n\tPeter Bentel, who was the architect who designed it, we talked about this idea we wanted the place to wear in well.  We wanted the bar, this black ebony bar, and we knew it was going to get worn, and the idea was don’t ever refinish this bar.  I don’t know if it’s been refinished since, but I remember we had a general manager come in, this one area was worn out, and he said, “I’m going to refinish the bar,” and I said, “No, you’re not.  Leave it alone.  Don’t touch it.”  We wanted this idea of this patina--that the place would weather and age really well.\n\tFlowers were also very important.  We had an in-house florist who just created essentially this table, this harvest table you walked by, filled with flowers, and to me that really kind of set the tone as well.\n\nQ:  Did everybody have flowers then the way they do now?\n\nColicchio:  Yes, I think so.\n\nQ:  It’s my recollection that it had an extraordinary cheese deal.\n\nColicchio:  Yes, and we were one of the first American restaurants to definitely do that.  I think Terrance Brennan came up with it right after that and, I would say, probably did it better than we did, but that was something that we wanted.\nDanny and I, before we opened the restaurant, we took a trip to Italy together, and that was one thing that we always ordered, and it was like why isn’t an American restaurant doing this and doing it well?  And so that’s something that we focused on.  In fact, when I came back, before the restaurant opened up—because it was two years between when we first started talking and when the restaurant opened up—I spent a portion of that time working at Dean & Deluca in their cheese shop.\n\nQ:  Learning or—\n\nColicchio:  Yes, I wanted to learn more about cheese, and that was a good way to do it.  They had a great program.  I worked one or two days a week.  In fact, I don’t even think they paid me.  I just wanted to go there and see how they handled their cheese.  I think it’s like anything, if you want to get good at it, you have to be around it.  You have to absorb it.  So definitely that was planned from day one.  We trained the staff on it.  Yes, that was something we purposely went after.\n\nQ:  This was strictly for the tavern part?\n\nColicchio:  No.  Dining room, tavern.\n\nQ:  The menu was less expensive, but also in the sense that you didn’t have to order a whole meal in the front.\n\nColicchio:  Right, right.  In the back was prix fixe, and the front was à la carte, and, yes, nothing was over $20 on the menu, at least when I was there, and that was all by design.  We wanted a place that you can drop by.  The restaurant needed to be a destination restaurant in the back, but it also needed to be a neighborhood restaurant in the front.\n\tThe front, I always thought, set the tone for that entire restaurant.  It was always busy and bustling and happening, and it was an eclectic group of people who were always in there, so it wasn’t your typical, like, you know, only bankers go to this one restaurant and this other restaurant is all artists.  This was a good cross-section of people in New York.\nBut, yes, it was all by design.  It was one of those things where sometimes you do it and it doesn’t work, and sometimes you do it and it just works and you know it.  This was one of those times.\n\nQ:  How aware of your success in achieving your goal were you at the time?\n\nColicchio:  Oh, very.  Yes, because just the numbers.  But it took time to grow, and we weren’t an immediate success, I don’t think.  I think the restaurant got a so-so review when we opened up.  We got two stars at a time when two stars—now it’s a little tougher.  I think you can get two stars now, it’s good.  Then we weren’t shooting for two; we were shooting for three.  Quite frankly, I thought we deserved more.  I didn’t think the restaurant was—we had problems.  We had a lot of problems when we first opened up, just really dealing with—I mean, the day before we opened up, we were on the cover of New York Magazine, Danny and I.  I don’t know if you remember the cover, but there were four stars on the cover and they said “Is this the next four-star restaurant?”  And there were eight pages of—you know.  So the expectations were so high.  We could never live up to them when we first opened up, but it took a lot of work.\n\tFor me, in the kitchen, I would purposely dumb-down the food that I was doing at Mondrian because the restaurant was so much bigger, and I remember we were doing—I don’t know if we covered this last time.  We were doing about 230, 240 covers every night in the dining room, and I got to a point, “You know, this isn’t working for me.”  I wanted to make food better, but the only way to do that is to cut covers.  I couldn’t do 240 a night anymore.\nSo I remember going to Danny and our other partner, Larry Goldberg, who was a GM at the time, saying, “I want to bring this back.  I want to drop down to about 180 covers a night.  I want to add some tasting menus.  I want to make the food better, and I guarantee you we’ll do more money.”\n\tThey both looked at me like I was crazy.  “How is that?  That doesn’t seem to work.”\nI said, “You’ve got to trust me on this one.  We can’t keep going on doing these kind of numbers.”\n\tAnd we did that.  We actually took some seats out of the restaurant, offered a tasting menu, and we did this right around the time of the Beard Awards, too, because we opened—I don’t remember anymore.  It’s almost like eight or nine months until the awards came around, and I knew that since we were the new restaurant in town, a lot of people would be coming in.  I was like, “I can’t do the food I’m doing right now.  I’ve got to make this better.”  And I think that’s when the restaurant changed.  Danny has a very different story about how the restaurant sort of turned the corner.\n\nQ:  What is his story?\n\nColicchio:  You’d have to ask him.\n\nQ:  Did it have to do with the food or—\n\nColicchio:  No, it’s a different story.\n\nQ:  When you say dumbed-down, in terms of the number of steps?\n\nColicchio:  Just the way we were cooking it, precooking some things.  Yes, the steps of it.  It really wasn’t where it needed to be.  Conceptually I was trying to also conceive of dishes that we can expedite quickly as opposed to just putting together great dishes.  I think it all came together.  Nick Mautone was our general manager.  Paul Grieco, who now has Hearth and Terroir wine bars, was our beverage director, our service director.  Claudia Fleming was in the kitchen doing desserts.  There was just a ton of talent in that restaurant, and so many people went on to be chefs or well-known front-of-house people or wine people from that restaurant.  It was a matter of just pulling all that together.\nFrom that moment we changed the food, that kind of changed things for the kitchen, but the restaurant getting to where it ended up, as far as the financial success of the restaurant, the critical success of the restaurant, it was a lot of hard work.  It was day in and day out.  I would stay after service.  In the private dining room, the wait staff would do their paperwork at the end of the night, and I would sit in there and we’d all have cocktails at the end of the night, and sit there and listen to them.  We would have these meetings and sit there.  It was just very impromptu, and listen to what they were having to say, difficulties.\nThe next day I’d go to work and sit down with management and go, “I listened to staff.  Try X, Y, Z.  These are the things they’re complaining about.  This is what we can get better.”\nThey said, “When is this happening?” \nI said, “It happens at one o’clock in the morning when you guys aren’t here.”  [laughs]\n\tBut it was something that we worked on every single day to make that restaurant what it was.  I don’t think you can sort of point to a particular moment or a particular thing that sort of turned the corner, but it was a lot of hard work, lot of hours.\n\nQ:  So between the time that you felt that was a success and the time when you thought about craft, what happened eventually?  Did you get bored?  Did you need another challenge?  Did you want to make more money?\n\nColicchio:  No, it wasn’t about being bored; it was about challenging yourself and also having something else inside that you want to get out.  It’s not just about this one type of food.  I wanted to do something else.  Part of it is in this day and age of chefs and restaurateurs, if you do it once, do it again.  On the other hand, there’s a business that we’re running and if you can handle two or three or four restaurants, you know, why not?  So I wanted to continue to grow and continue to do new things.\n\nQ:  Because your books were starting to—\n\nColicchio:  Well, it had nothing to do with that.  It was really about—\n\nQ:  No, I just mean it’s a lot to balance.\n\nColicchio:  Yes, but it’s really not.  It is and it isn’t.  It’s all just work.  You put together a team of people and you figure out a way to work the books.  We would meet twice a week in the morning at my apartment and go through recipes and work with the writer.  My wife actually ended up writing the book.  I [originally] had another writer on the project.  So it’s a process, and you just sort of stick to it and that’s it, and that’s how we would do it.\n\tI would still go to work.  I would do that from nine o’clock in the morning until twelve, one o’clock, and then I’d go to work at two o’clock in the afternoon and work till twelve, one o’clock at night.\n\tThe photography we did all in the restaurant.  We had [unclear] in the back, so I’d do all the dishes and do the photography.  It’s just a matter of managing your time.\n\tDanny had decided that he wanted to grow.  We were looking at some other restaurants.  I had planned on staying, up to this point, with the Union Square Hospitality Group, and then I decided not to.  I, quite frankly, didn’t like the—\n\nQ:  Corporate, I guess?\n\nColicchio:  No, I got ….. \n\n[Interruption]\n\nColicchio:  So Danny had started growing Union Square Hospitality Group, Two Spaces and Tabla and 11 Madison, and right around this time he created the Union Square Hospitality Group, and I didn’t like my role in the company.  I wanted to have the freedom to open new restaurants where I did what I did at Gramercy.  I designed it; I built it; I was the chef there; I was the managing partner there. And clearly that was not my role.  He had brought other people who would do that, so if I did another restaurant, I would be involved in the food and that was it, and that’s not what I wanted to do.  And I got it. I understood it, but it’s not what I wanted to do.\n\tSo I saw the space that became craft.  It was actually a chairman who was head of the co-op board approached me and wanted to talk to me about garbage and pest control, things like that, and I asked him if I could see the space.  He said, “Well, we have a lease.  We’re ready to sign with another group.  I just wanted to talk to you about it.”  Okay.\nA month or two went by, I didn’t see anything happening there.  I called him back and I said, “Well, did you sign a lease?”\n\tHe said, “No, we didn’t.  It fell apart.”\n\tI said, “Do you want to talk?”\n\tHe said, “We have somebody else.”\n\tI said, “Okay.”\n\tA couple months go by, nothing’s happening again.  Contact him again.  He said, “No, that fell through.  Let’s talk.”\nSo we worked out a deal, and the restaurant opened.\nGramercy was part of Union Square Hospitality Group.  There were separate owners.  It wasn’t owned by the Union Square Hospitality Group; it was owned by me and Danny and one other partner.  Well, Danny’s mother, I think, and uncle and my partner, Robert Scott.  I was an investor in the restaurant, and the way that worked is Robert Scott, who owned Mondrian and came with us to invest in Gramercy, he guaranteed a loan for me.  So I had to put money in the restaurant and I had to repay this loan, so I was an investor alongside of everybody, and that’s the way that was set up.\n\tSo craft opens up, and my intention was to do both.  At some point, Danny came to me and said, “We can’t both own this restaurant anymore.  One of us should own it.”\n\tI said, “Well, I’m not leaving, so if that’s what you really believe, then give me a number and I’ll put together a buyout.”\n\nQ:  We did talk about the philosophy of craft.  What we didn’t talk about in 2001 was 9/11 and when that fit into the opening of the restaurant, when you got married, all of that.\n\nColicchio:  The restaurant opened right before 9/11.  It opened in—I think it was May.  No, it wasn’t May.  We’re in May now.  We just celebrated our anniversary.  March.  So we were open a few months before 9/11.  I don’t know what you wanted.\n\nQ:  I wanted you to talk a little bit about your response to 9/11, what happened in terms of getting the food down there, and also that you got married at a difficult time.\n\nColicchio:  Yes, I got married four days after.  I was on the Vineyard when it happened.  I got married on Martha’s Vineyard, so I was there when it happened.\n\nQ:  But you did play a role, as I understand it, in going down there and helping.\n\nColicchio:  So many of us did, yes.  There was a boat that was donated by, I think—I forget who did that now. Yachts, I guess.  They anchored a boat down by the Winter Garden and there was a feeding station.  So rescue workers would come in at night or go during the day, and that’s where they would eat.  I worked midnight shift, so I got down there at twelve o’clock at night and I’d work till eight o’clock in the morning.  It didn’t last.  I think I did it for a couple weeks, and then they just didn’t need it anymore.\n\nQ:  Did going out to eat in general drop off?\n\nColicchio:  Oh, sure, sure, sure.  I mean, well, we closed for a few days.  Yes.  People were nervous.  People were scared.  Business came back, but, yes, it wasn’t great right after we opened it, this happened.  I think having a dip in business paled in comparison to what people lost.\n\nQ:  So craft got going.  Were you thinking, once that got going, how you could expand your business, your talents, your what?\n\nColicchio:  No.  It wasn’t about sort of sitting down and having a master plan of what would happen.  Things have a way of happening in our business.  After craft opened up, we won a Beard Award for best new restaurant.  The day after the awards, I met Gamal Aziz, who was the president of the MGM, and he was in for lunch and said, “I want to talk to you about doing something in Vegas.”\n\tI said, “Oh, great.  Let’s talk.”\nFlew out to Vegas, met with him, and he showed me the space.  He said, “We want you to do a steakhouse.”\n\tI said, “Well, I’m really not interested in doing a steakhouse.  I just opened craft.  I would love to do another craft.”\n\tHe said, “Well, you can do whatever you want as long as it’s a steakhouse.”\n\tI was like, “Okay.”  But then I thought about it and I was like, well, you know, I could easily see how you can adapt a craft model to a steakhouse.  In fact, it was reversed the other way.  I looked at steakhouses and said, well, why can’t you do really high-end food, where you order your protein and you order your sides.  So it was a very easy fit.\nSo we agreed to do that, and they also let my team do it.  Peter Bentel designed it.  It has a very sort of craft feel to it, and wildly successful.\n\nQ:  How many top-end restaurants were out there at that point?\n\nColicchio:  Oh, it was already the beginning of—the first wave already had passed.  Jean  Georges’s Prime Steakhouses were already there.  Charlie Palmer already had his steakhouse out there.  When I thought about it, all the restaurants doing really well out there were all steakhouses.  So I was like, you know what?  Let’s not fight this.\n\tThings just kind of happened for us because of real estate.  We had the space right next door to craft became available, and that’s where we did craftbar, the first craftbar.  Marco Canora and I are both Italian Americans.  He was a chef at craft at the time.  We both talked about doing this sort of casual Italian almost wine-bar-type restaurant, and so that’s what we did.  So that was, again, wildly successful.  There was a two-hour wait at night to get into the restaurant.  We since then moved it around the corner to a bigger location, but then the space next door to that was available.\n\tOriginally, we had the name ‘wichcraft, my wife threw out there, for craftbar.  I said, “That’s a great name, but it doesn’t tell the whole story.”  So when we got that third space, Sisha Ortuzar, who’s my partner now and co-founder of ʼwichcraft, he’s the one who came up to me at one point and said, “Why don’t we do sandwiches.  We have this great name.  Why don’t we do it?”  And so we did it.\n\tBut if you looked at what we did, and this was the only thing we really did by design, was that we want these difference price points.  We want craft to be the flagship, and that was a high-end $100-a-person check average, and then we wanted to have something in the $50-check range, craftbar, and then ‘wichcraft was even lower, $12-check average.  So we felt that as long as there was a thread that we could weave through the whole thing, that this would be a successful model.\nWe kind of looked at clothing designers.  If you look at, like, Ralph Lauren, there’s Purple label, there’s Polo, there’s Ralph Lauren, there’s R&L, and they’re all different price points, but there is a certain quality that goes through the whole line.  So we actually looked at that as a model as to how we can sort of price this.\nIt worked out really well.  We didn’t have any help with branding at all.  We kind of did it ourselves.  It all just kind of grew organically.\n\nQ:  You mean into a numbers of locations?\n\nColicchio:  Yes.\n\nQ:  I’m at the library a lot at 42nd Street, and it just seems like— What do you call it in a shopping mall when some place is the prime place?\n\nColicchio:  The anchor.\n\nQ:  Yes.  It does seem to have that feel to it, not to mention the fact that the food is better than anything else around there.\n\nColicchio:  ‘wichcraft was sort of its own business.  Actually, it’s a separate company.\n\nQ:  Do you play a role now in figuring out where and when to open new ones?\n\nColicchio:  I play a little bit of a role.  My guys, they come to me and say, “We’re looking at a location. What do you think?”  And I’ll give my blessing.  To that extent, yes. \n\nQ:  So what happened between that period of your life and Top Chef?\n\nColicchio:  I got a call out of the blue from a producer who said, “We’re doing this food show.  It’s a reality show, and we think you’d be great as a judge.”\n\tI was like, “Nah, no interest.”\n\tThey called me back a week later and said, “We really think you’d be great for the show.  Can we send someone just to interview you?”\n\tI was like, “Fine.”\n\tSo they someone with a little handheld camera and asked me a few questions on camera.  They called me back a week later and they said, “We’d love you to come out to L.A. for a screen test.”\n\tI said, “No, I’m not coming out to L.A. for a screen test.  Here’s what I’ll do.”  There was an ABC producer, produced news, who did a documentary series on—it’s called Life 360, and they did one on restaurants.  There were supposed to be three different restaurants, but they ended up just using us.  They got there and we were opening craft.  So from the very early planning stages to when it opened, they documented the whole thing.  So I said, “Listen, we have this whole series.  I’ll send it to you.”  So I sent them.\n\tThen they called up, said, “We want to make an offer.”\n\tThat’s when I started taking them seriously.  I was all like, “All right.  Let me think about this.”  I sat down with them.  I was familiar with Project Runway.  They produced that.\n\nQ:  Familiar from the point of watching it?\n\nColicchio:  Yes, a little bit, just aware of it.  So once they told me they did that, I watched it, and they sent me some tapes and I watched it.  They told me what they were looking for my sort of role to be.  It was kind of a combination of a Tim Gunn mentor and a Michael Kors judge, that kind of role.  I was like, “All right,” and I, for some reason, agreed to do it.\n\nQ:  I was looking online and I saw—I guess it was a promo of you with Kathy Lee Joel.\n\nColicchio:  (nods and smiles) That was an early one, yes.\n\nQ:  You looked a little doubtful about how all of this was really going to materialize, or what would materialize.  I wondered if you could describe what your concerns were.\n\nColicchio:  No one tells you how to do it.  They don’t tell you how to do TV, so all of a sudden, you get there and they throw you into the situation.  I was comfortable at this point in front of the camera from doing Today Show spots and things like that, so that wasn’t much of an issue.  But just the format and how we were going to work this.  These very things that we do now, we take for granted now, these are things that it’s like one day all of sudden someone will say, “Well, why don’t we try this?”  I remember one day at the end of judges’ table, I just decided to do this rundown on each contest that was there, and when I was finished, they went, “That was great.”  So that’s something we do all the time now.\n\nQ:  Genius.\n\nColicchio:  Well, it’s not.  For me, it’s not that at all.  It just felt right.  For me, I’m not an actor and I’m not there to deliver some witty one-liners and sort of knock the chefs down.  For me, if we were going to do this, I wanted it to be a serious food show, I want the chefs to be high-caliber chefs and I wanted the conversation to be about the food.  I didn’t want to go to sort of a personal thing.  All that personal stuff that happens behind the scene, we don’t see it, we don’t know about it, we don’t care about it, and my feeling was that the only way for this to be successful, because you can’t eat the food, as a viewer you can’t experience the food, the only way to experience the food is through a conversation that the judges are having about the dishes.\n\tFrom day one, it was like, “Listen, this has to be about the food.  It has to be a conversation that we’re serious about, or it’s not going to work.  If we’re going to come here and just kind of throw out one-liners, this isn’t going to last three seasons and it’s going to be a joke.”  My biggest concern was that the industry wouldn’t take this seriously.\n\nQ:  I was wondering about that, because when it first came out, people said, “Tom Colicchio?  What is this about?”  So you must have said the same thing.  [both laugh]\n\nColicchio:  Oh, I did.  When we were shooting this thing, I was like, “Oh, what did I get myself into?  This is going to be tough.”  And the first season was, but, luckily, we had good contestants the first season.  I think that’s what really made it, having chefs like Lee Ann and Harold and Tiffani.  They were all really strong, and personalities like a Dave or a Stephen.  So it was a good combination of people who really cared about food, but a good combination of strong personalities and some really good cooks.  So it worked.  God knows why, but it worked.\n\nQ:  Did you have a role in choosing the—\n\nColicchio:  No.\n\nQ:  Who does that?\n\nColicchio:  There’s casting agents that do it.\n\nQ:  So that you see these people when?  When they first turn up for the season?\n\nColicchio:  When they’re on camera the first time is when we see them the first time.  We are not allowed to interact with the contestants at all when we’re shooting.  Unless we’re on camera, we can’t talk to them.  There’s a group of PAs that keep them away from us to the point where we’re not even allowed to walk by them.  I mean, they really keep it on lockdown.  All that stuff that goes on in the house and all that, we have no idea that’s going on.  So it’s really honest.\n\tThe other thing, when I first started, when I agreed to do this, I said, “Listen, I’m not going to be a pawn of some producer.  The judges have to decide who stays and who goes.”\n\tThey were like, “Yes, that’s fine,” and they’ve never, with the exception of one person who physically manhandled someone that had to go home, producers never choose who stays and who goes.\n\nQ:  It sounds like, then, that you had a fairly big role in actually developing the format.\n\nColicchio:  It wasn’t a role that was given to me from the beginning.  It just happened, again, organically, just going through it.  I don’t watch reality TV, so I have no idea what would work, what wouldn’t work, but it just felt like this is what we should be doing.  This is the kind of way it should work.  You know, it’s great.  We’ve got a great production team.\nAgain, my concern was that I wanted the industry to at least look at this and say, “Hey, this is worthwhile,” and they have.  I knew we had something when in the second season, I started getting calls from chefs saying, “Can I be a judge?  How do I get on the show?”\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nColicchio:  Now there is only one person that is a well-known chef who hasn’t done the show, and it’s Mario Batali.  He just won’t do it for whatever reason.  And he watches the show.  He’s a fan.  His kids watch it.  But he doesn’t want to be that guy.\n\nQ:  Why do you think that they want to do it?\n\nColicchio:  Exposure.  Sure.  Again, I didn’t do it for the exposure, because I didn’t know—I took a risk.  And also, I’d seen other reality shows, and if this ever turned into like let’s eat bugs, I’m out.  I’m done.\n\nQ:  Did you watch any cooking shows at any other point in your life, or for that matter before you did this?\n\nColicchio:  Not really, no.\n\nQ:  Not even Jacques Pépin?\n\nColicchio:  I read Jacques’ books and I learned a lot from his books, but, no, I don’t watch—I find the stand-and-stir shows to be boring.  I don’t learn anything.  I know how to cook, so I’m not watching to learn, and I just find them all to be somewhat boring.  As a professional chef I do.  I’m sure as a casual or as a hobbyist [cook], yes, you learn a lot.\n\nQ:  What a lot of people say about Jacques Pépin is his hands are so extraordinary and it’s fascinating, the knife skills.  You don’t need that.  The rest of us do need it.\n\nColicchio:  I see that, yes.  But that’s different when you’re—I mean, Jacques is a professional chef who spent many, many years with a knife in his hand, and so that doesn’t impress me.  It’s like, oh, yes, of course, why not.  [laughs]  I hope he’s that good.  He’s a great guy, Jacques.  He’s the best, really.  I spent some time with him last week.  He’s amazing.\n\nQ:  It’s a very welcoming personality.\n\nColicchio:  And the Jacques and Julia [Child] series, that’s just so iconic.  If I’m surfing and see it on, I’ll watch it for five minutes and go, “That’s great,” and move on.\n\nQ:  So how does this work in your life?  You go where for how long?\n\nColicchio:  One month.\n\nQ:  But where do you physically—\n\nColicchio:  It all depends.  First season was San Francisco, second season was L.A., then Miami, then Chicago, then Vegas.\n\nQ:  What I mean is it a studio that is replaced in—\n\nColicchio:  Yes.\n\nQ:  I see.  How does that work?\n\nColicchio:  They pick it up and rebuild it.  We rented a warehouse.  They build the kitchen, the Top Chef kitchen in that studio, but then we do a lot of location stuff.  But once we go to a town, we typically don’t move.  We stay there.  We’ll travel a little bit, but we always have to go back to judges’ table that’s in the studio.  It takes about a month to shoot the whole thing, five weeks tops, and I work every other day, because I don’t do the Quickfires.  So it takes two days to shoot an episode, one day for Quickfire, announcing the elimination challenge, following the nomination, and that’s it.  Then the third day, we’re back into Quickfire.  There’s no break.\n\nQ:  So how many are in each season?\n\nColicchio:  If there are seventeen contestants or eighteen contestants, there’s usually fifteen episodes, because you go to the finale with three, so fifteen, sixteen episodes.  Sixteen, I think, with the reunion.  We’ll do everything leading up to the finale, so we’ll shoot everything but the finale, and then we’ll wait three or four months and then shoot the finale.\n\nQ:  Can you describe how this has changed your life?  I assume, first of all, financially it’s changed your life.  Maybe not.\n\nColicchio:  First three seasons, they didn’t pay us much at all.  It’s a risk everybody takes.  It’s definitely better now.  Not that much financially.  Things come out of it that financially are great, like commercials.  I did two commercials.  And also personal appearances, also speaking engagements, which could be very lucrative and they’re fairly easy to do hours of your time.  I don’t do a whole lot of them only because I have a business to run, so I can’t be on the road as much.  I need to be here.  I need to be around.  So I’ll do a few.\n\tThere’s a downside of the show, for me, anyway, and that is, if you ask the average person, they would say that I spend three or four months doing the show and I’m no longer in my restaurants, because all I do is TV, and it’s just not the truth.\n\nQ:  That would be very irritating.\n\nColicchio:  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve told this to journalists, and they never print it.  So when I say it takes about twenty-five days of a year to shoot the show, they think I’m lying to them.  People think that you spend a week doing the show, and then it airs, and then you’re back and you work another week, and then it airs and you do another week.  So if there are sixteen episodes, it’s sixteen weeks.  So for sixteen weeks I’m doing the show.\n\tI’ve had people literally walk into my restaurant Wednesday nights saying, “What are you doing here?”\n\t“What are you talking about?”\n\t“Don’t you have a TV show to do?”\n\tLike, “Are you kidding me?  We shot that in August, like last year.”\n\t“Really?”\n\t“Yes.”\n\tThere’s this whole other sort of idea that if you’re doing TV, you’ve sold out and you’re not a chef anymore.  It’s silly.\n\nQ:  I would imagine it would make you want to stay in the kitchen longer.\n\nColicchio:  Well, actually, because of TV, there’s things that I did to combat that, and that’s Tuesday dinners.  We had this open kitchen in our private dining room.  I’ll go do these dinners and physically I’m there and you’ll see that I’m there, and, to me, that was something that came directly from this idea that I’m not in the kitchen anymore.  It is frustrating, because I do spend time in my restaurants and I like to spend time in my restaurants.  The last month I’ve taken off because I’ve had a baby.  Frankly, family commitments take me out of the restaurant more than the TV show does.  Last night, my son’s going to nursery school, and there was a parents’ thing, get-together for nursery school, so I was out of my restaurant.\n\nQ:  Then you’ll have back-to-school night.  [laughs]\n\nColicchio:  I will have all that stuff happening again.  I’ll have to start looking for colleges for my son, so I’ve got to take him on the road looking for colleges, my older son.\n\nQ:  You’re really going to do a road trip?\n\nColicchio:  Yes.\n\nQ:  That will startle people.  Well, actually, for that matter, do people feel because you’re on television all the time, they can just come up to you and you’ll talk to them?\n\nColicchio:  Yes.\n\nQ:  How does that work?\n\nColicchio:  Well, sometimes it’s fine and sometimes it is not.  Living in New York City, usually if you’re walking down the street somebody will give a nod, they recognize you.  They may say, “Hey, I like the show.”  That’s great.  Usually I’ll respond back.  Where it really gets crazy is at a food event.\n\nQ:  You mean like the food and wine thing in Aspen?\n\nColicchio:  It gets a little nutty.  Aspen’s not as bad as say some others, but it gets a little crazy.  They start grabbing at you.  I’m like, “There’s no need to grab me.  You want to take a picture, ask.  I’ll take a picture.  You don’t have to grab me.”  It’s like, “What’s going on here?”  It’s bizarre.\n\nQ:  Television makes you personal property of people?\n\nColicchio:  I guess.  And if you say, no, on a blog you’re some jerk that doesn’t care.  But, you know, I’m having to deal with my family.  I don’t need someone—it’s annoying.\n\nQ:  Actually, since you mentioned blogging, you do blog for Top Chef.\n\nColicchio:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Have you done that since the beginning?\n\nColicchio:  I think from the second season on.\n\nQ:  How do you decide what to do or how much time to give to it?\n\nColicchio:  It all depends.  Usually it’s a recap of the episode.  Occasionally I’ll get on a soapbox.  When we had Stephanie, who won season four, I think it was, there was talk about the first woman winner, and my feeling was that I don’t think she wants to be known as the first woman winner.  She’s a chef who happens to be a woman.  I talked about equality in the workplace and specific to the restaurant industry and why more women—it’s not surprising that she’s the first woman to win Top Chef, because, quite frankly, there aren’t a lot of women in our industry.\nWhen we cast the show, we cast equal amounts of men and women, and that’s also another reason why a lot of times the women are the first couple to go.  It’s just there are very few women chefs.  I list all the social reasons why I think that happens.\n\nQ:  It’s hard to have a family life if you’re going to try to do that [unclear].\n\nColicchio:  It’s hard to have a family if you’re a man, too, but socially there’s a different set of expectations, right?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nColicchio:  And we don’t set those.  I mean, I don’t set that up.  But it is difficult.  It’s very difficult.  If you look at probably the two most influential chefs in the last ten years, Ferran Adria  and Thomas Keller, neither one of them are married.  Ferran just got married, and they don’t have kids.  So I think that the whole family life really gets in the way a lot more than TV does.  TV is not that big of a deal, but definitely it changes your life, and not always for the best.\n\nQ:  How much have you expanded your business or been able to expand your business since you’ve been doing Top Chef?\n\nColicchio:  Well, again, my business is run complete independent from that show.  It’s a completely different process, so the business just runs.  Again, it takes so little of my time, I don’t ever consider like should I open a restaurant or do another season.  It’s just not part of the equation.\n\nQ:  What is a workweek like when you’re not doing Top Chef?\n\nColicchio:  I’m usually in the restaurant somewhere between twelve and two, sometimes as early as ten.  Before the new baby, sometimes I’d get in the office at ten o’clock and work until like ten o’clock at night.  It all depends.  Sometimes I’m here.  I might have to run out of the office, out of the restaurant and go somewhere else.  When Colicchio & Sons first opened up, I was here from like ten in the morning until twelve o’clock at night for the first three months at least.  I dialed that back a little bit where I was coming in a little later, but I’m usually working from twelve o’clock to ten o’clock, around.\n\nQ:  You must get a lot of requests to do charitable events.\n\nColicchio:  Yes.\n\nQ:  I realize all chefs do, but how do you figure that out?\n\nColicchio:  If it’s a friend asking, I’ll almost always say yes, even if I’m not connected to whatever charity it is.  The things that I like to support are hunger issues, children’s issues, and the environment.  I pick and choose.  I mean, there’s some events I’ll always do.  Marc Vetry in Philadelphia has an event called Alex’s Lemonade Stand, that’s just a wonderful event, and I did it three years ago for the first time and told him I’ll do it every year.  I do my own event for Children of Bellevue every year.  I sit on the board of Children of Bellevue.  I just joined the advisory board of Happy Baby.\n\nQ:  What is that?\n\nColicchio:  It’s an organic baby food company, and it’s a really great company.\n\nQ:  What do you feed your children?\n\nColicchio:  I have to say my wife does a great job of—I would say 90 percent of what my son Luka eats is organic, and we cook at home for him.  He eats what we eat.\n\nQ:  I am always amazed at these lines of baby food that come out, because I made my baby food, not because I was a lunatic about it, but because I was living in England and you went into the stores and the baby food was so full of cereal, so basically I just chopped up and blended what we were eating.\n\nColicchio:  Purées, yes.  We started out, somebody gave us this cooker.  It’s an all-in-one thing that actually steams the vegetables and then it purees it right in the same—it was really easy.  But then once we sort of got him past the purée period, we would just chop up what we were eating really fine.  That’s it.  Now he eats everything.  He loves broccoli, asks for broccoli.  It’s his favorite thing to eat.  Eats spicy food.  Doesn’t matter.  It’s great to watch him.  It eventually will change and they go through this period where they won’t eat green stuff, whatever.\n\nQ:  Maybe not.\n\nColicchio:  Who knows?  Usually it’s when they go to school and their friends start saying, “That’s icky.”  But he’s a great eater.  The little guy gets mother’s milk and that’s it.\n\nQ:  I have noticed your involvement in food stamps and school lunches and childhood hunger.  When did that start, your activity there?\n\nColicchio:  It’s kind of always been like that.  Again, not me, but our industry really sort of rallies around hunger issues.  It’s just natural for us.  I think Billy Shore started that with SOS [Share Our Strength].  SOS was really one of the first organizations to come in and really coalesce behind chefs, and since then it’s become—I think, again, because we feed so many people who are coming to our restaurant and are spending money, but I think that at some level you’ve got to believe that people have a right to eat nutritious food.\n\tFor years, twenty or thirty years, as long as I’ve been cooking, whether it’s doing events for Meals on Wheels, God’s Love We Deliver, Food Bank of New York, City Harvest, SOS, we’re doing these events and raising money, and the problem is just getting worse.  These organizations all do great work, so you’ve got to look at this problem and say this is a systemic problem with what we’re doing in this country.  There’s no food policy in this country.  There’s farm policy.  There’s no food policy.\n\tMy wife, actually, and her partner, Kristi Jacobson, who was the one who came to me and said, “Tom, I’m thinking of doing this film on hunger.  What do you think?”\n\nQ:  I was going to ask you about that.\n\nColicchio:  I figured that’s where we were going.\n\nQ:  Well, actually, I want to ask you about testifying before Congress too.\n\nColicchio:  That’s all part of it.\n\nQ:  How so?\n\nColicchio:  We shot that, actually, for a film.  It’s not how it came about, but it was convenient that we were shooting at the same time.\nWhat happened is through various organizations as we were doing the film, this one organization, FRAC [Food Research and Action Center], they set up lobbying days, because there’s a group of people out there that believe the government can fix this problem, and I know right now a lot of people think government is the problem, but government should fix this problem.  We’re the only industrialized country who doesn’t feed their poor.  Because of raising money for so many organizations for so long, the charity model doesn’t work.\n\nQ:  Tell me what you mean by that.\n\nColicchio:  Well, the idea of this charity model where you have to go out as an organization and raise money through doing events or trying to raise money for charity to run your food pantry, it doesn’t work, and it shouldn’t have to work.  All those organizations, if government takes more of a role, they’ll still need to be there, but government should be funding these organizations.\nBut, also, if you look at the way food is produced in this country and what we subsidize, when you’re subsidizing corn, wheat, and soy, all the things that go into fast food or highly processed foods to make them cheap, and you’re not subsidizing fruits and vegetables, so when you go into a fast-food place, a burger costs less money than a peach.  It shouldn’t happen, and it’s kind of crazy when you think about it.\n\tSo government needs to sort of look at this.  It’s a very cynical look at this, but if you looked and said if government was trying to kill off a population of people, they would subsidize these ingredients, turn them into highly processed food, and they would die of heart disease and obesity and diabetes.  If you look at the rates of all this stuff, obesity, there’s a much higher instance in the inner city than anywhere else.\nSo we’ve got to wake up and say, “These are the not the things that we should be subsidizing.”  We’re basically subsidizing a whole industry, and that’s why it’s cheaper.  That’s why people use it.\n\tIt’s very easy for people to blame parents.  “Well, they’re letting them eat this stuff.”  Well, if you have a hard time and you’re struggling putting food on a table, it’s a lot cheaper to walk into a fast-food place and buy a burger and fries and a sweetened drink that provides very little nourishment and a lot of fat and sugar, than it is to put a nutritious meal on the table.  I mean, especially when you’re working two or three jobs trying to make ends meet, when do you have time to come home and cook?  But, yes, you can’t put fresh fruits and vegetables.  They cost too much money.  So government can step up and stop subsidizing that stuff and start subsidizing food, real food, or just stop subsidizing other stuff, and farmers can create more of a marketplace for farmers.\n\tThat’s why, if you look at school lunch, if there was a mandate that a certain amount of food in school lunch had to be fresh organic produce—forget organic for a second, just fresh produce, you’d create more of a market for those farmers so the prices would come down.  But if you go to a Greenmarket, you know, the Greenmarkets we have here in New York City, it’s expensive, but that’s the real cost of food.\n\nQ:  I think most people don’t realize that.  They don’t realize that other countries, people pay more for their food.  I didn’t realize until the last farm bill, when I had to cover it, that the way that fruits and vegetables are referred to in the farm bill is under this specialty-crop designation, as though it were something exotic.  Weird.\n\nColicchio:  It’s crazy.\n\nQ:  As opposed to what we should be eating all the time.\n Colicchio:  Right.  So FRAC, they set up a lobbying day.\n\nQ:  FRAC is?\n\nColicchio:  Food Research Action [Center], I believe.  So they asked me if I would be interested in coming down and testifying, and I said, “Sure.  Why not.”  Actually, my wife really put this piece together that I delivered.  It was interesting to see how it all works, because then, obviously, I stayed very close to what was going on and what happened to that bill that was originally in the House and the president asked for 10 billion dollars over ten years that got watered down to 8 billion in the House, and then 4 and a half billion in the Senate.  Then they decided to take 2 and a half billion to fund that from SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program], which is crazy.\n\nQ:  Again, a new word that really means something else.\n\nColicchio:  Yes.  But watching that process, and then I went to the signing of the bill.  The president signed it at a public school in Washington, and I went down for the signing.  It was just interesting to watch the process, but testifying was interesting.\n\nQ:  Did people feel familiar with you because—\n\nColicchio:  Some, yes.\n\nQ:  How did that show itself?\n\nColicchio:  Afterwards, I took pictures and things like that.  And I talked about the idea that I’m a celebrity and that’s why people will listen.  But it was interesting, watching the process, but in the end, I think so many of us were disappointed by the final outcome of that bill, really disappointed, because the real number, if you talk to some experts, they say 40 billion dollars would fix the problem, and 4 billion is just putting another Band-aid on it.\nBut I think the problem with school lunches, there’s a great book by a woman named Janet Poppendieck, who wrote a book called Free For All.  She makes a great case, but if you look at the way the argument is always couched for school lunch, it’s always about free lunch and taking care of people who can’t afford lunch, where the three-tired system, the free, the reduced, and the full price, it’s all subsidized.  The full price is subsidized too.  So why aren’t parents who are sending their kids to public school, who are paying for the full lunch, why aren’t they complaining about the quality of the food in that lunchroom?  Everybody should be complaining about it.  It’s shocking how bad it is.\n\nQ:  At the Washington Post, there are periods of time when people are asked to various charitable things, and one of the things that I got involved with doing was going to read with children at a local public school during their lunch period, and what shocked me wasn’t the food; it was the way it came.  They didn’t have a kitchen, and so everything was in plastic.  So, for example, if you had a hamburger, the meat would be in plastic, separately the bun would be in plastic, the condiments would be in plastic.\n\nColicchio:  Disgusting.\n\nQ:  Making it very easy to throw away, actually, as well as eat.  I thought, god, I understood why, if you don’t have a cafeteria, why that happens, but—\n\nColicchio:  But they don’t have a cafeteria because they sold all the equipment and got rid of it.  They didn’t want cafeterias.  This is going back to the eighties where all that got gutted.\nIn 1968, I think it was, CBS, Edward R. Murrow and Charles Kuralt did a documentary called Hunger in America.  Our film is not going to be called Hungry in America, by the way; that’s just a working title.  At some point they showed a kid dying in the hospital, and they pulled back the camera and they said, “This isn’t a Third World country; this is America.”  It was in West Virginia.  And people were up in arms.  They couldn’t believe that this was happening in the greatest country in the world.  Very quickly, Senator [Robert J.] Dole and [George] McGovern sponsored bills.  They created the food safety net, pretty much eliminated hunger, until the eighties and the ideology changed, and that’s when all those programs were gutted.  That’s when everything started changing again.\nSo, again, there was a political solution to hunger once before, and there could be one again.  The political climate right now, nothing’s going to happen, although I think the farm bill, I see all subsidies ending, I really do, because I think a lot of that’s going to get cut out, because if you’re going to start cutting, well, why are we cutting there?  Corn’s at an all-time high right now, so why are we subsidizing it?  It’s like gas.  Why are we subsidizing gas companies?  Same thing is going to come out, and I think they’re going to lose some of those subsidies.  But we’ll see.  That’s on both sides of the aisle.  If you don’t think Tom Harkin’s fighting for subsidies for his constituency in Iowa, you’re kidding yourself.\n\nQ:  That tends to be according to the state you represent, as opposed to the political party.\n\nColicchio:  Yes, that’s right.\n\nQ:  Is the film that you’re working with a full-length film?\n\nColicchio:  Yes.\n\nQ:  For television, for movies, for what?\n\nColicchio:  We hope it has theatrical release.  We’re doing it with Participant Media.  They did Inconvenient Truth and they did The Cove and Waiting for Superman, so it’s well financed.  The great thing about Participant, what they do besides just financing the film, they finance a huge outreach program that goes along with the film.  They’re a very socially minded company.  They’re a great partner to have.  It will open up in one of the festivals, probably Toronto in September, and then from there, they’ll look for a sale, whether it’s theatrical or HBO or something.  That’s where it’ll end up.\n\nQ:  The role that you and your wife have in this is what?\n\nColicchio:  I’m executive producer, which means absolutely nothing.  Very early on, I funded a little bit until we got partners.  My wife is directing, producing and directing with her partner, Kristi Jacobson, so they’re both producer/directors.\n\nQ:  In the various things I’ve read about you, it describes things that you do, like play the guitar, box, and things like that.  Do you have time for any of that?\n\nColicchio:  I make time.  I’m up at six in the morning with my son, and somewhere between like seven o’clock and eight o’clock, I’ll pick up the guitar and play for an hour, and I’ll play when I go home.  So when I go home tonight after work, I’ll play for an hour or so, usually just sitting there on the couch, just noodling around with my guitar, playing.\n\tBoxing three days a week, if I’m in town, ten o’clock in the morning.  I’m home by twelve and showered and at work.\n\nQ:  You do it at a gym?\n\nColicchio:  Yes, a boxing gym.  I fish as much as I can.  I almost never go out to eat.  I just don’t.\n\nQ:  I can’t figure out when you can eat.\n\nColicchio:  You know when I eat?  If I’m in the restaurant, we have family meal twice a day, and that’s when I eat, or I eat when I go home.  Tonight I’m not sure where I’m eating.  We have a house on the North Fork of Long Island so I’m going to go out there tonight.  But I don’t go out to restaurants often.  I actually need to start going out more, since I enjoy it, but it’s hard to make plans.\n\nQ:  When was the last time you regularly shopped?\n\nColicchio:  For food?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nColicchio:  We do a lot of our shopping online for the house.  Fresh Direct is great.  I was shopping probably last week over at Chelsea Market.  Yes, shopping last weekend, I think it was.\nI lead a very normal life.  That’s what’s amazing, is that I wake up in the morning with the kids and I brew a pot of coffee and watch MSNBC until [unclear] starts at eight o’clock, and then I sort of get on with my day.  It’s funny, sometimes people have this idea you’re sitting on a beach somewhere with someone fixing me cocktails all day long, and that’s my life.  No, that’s not it.  Still working.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Is there anything that we haven’t talked about that you would want people to know about you or your life, that we haven’t covered so far?  There must be something.\n\nColicchio:  I don’t know.  We covered a lot.  I love to fish.  Fishing season’s starting up.  Going tomorrow.\n\nQ:  Where will you fish?\n\nColicchio:  Tomorrow, out on Long Island.  Actually, I’m fishing Saturday.  Tomorrow’s Friday.  But that’s my passion, is being on the water.  Absolutely love it.  But, no, I lead a fairly boring life.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Any new projects, new seasons of—\n\nColicchio:  We start shooting in July.  I don’t think we’re airing until November.\n\nQ:  Has it been announced where that will be?\n\nColicchio:  No.  [laughs]  There’s certain things I can’t announce.  That’s up to Bravo.  We have to keep a lid on it, too, because it’s so popular now, people try to figure out where we’re shooting.  We’ve had people who camp out, like, in Chicago.  We had a photographer camp out.\n\nQ:  Groupies.\n\nColicchio:  Well, they’ll camp out, and what they’ll try to do is try to figure out who’s getting eliminated from the show, based who’s coming in and out of the house.  So we have ways to sort of throw people off.  If you’re eliminated from the show, you don’t go home.  You stay.  You’re just off camera, but you’re still around.  Because it’s gotten crazy.\n\tI love watching the people when they’re like, “Oh, I’m looking at this photo.  I know this person won because of this and this and this.”  And you laugh and go, “You’re so wrong.”  It’s like, “Come on.  Like we’re that dumb?”\n\nQ:  How long can you keep this up, do you think?\n\nColicchio:  I don’t know.  It all depends on the rating, obviously.  I don’t know.  I’m on for another two seasons at least.\nMy wife and I are working on something scripted, not for me to be in, but a scripted show based on the restaurant.  If we’ll sell that, it would be great.\nI’m trying to think if there’s anything else.  I think that’s about it.\n\nQ:  Thank you very much.  This is great.  Thank you.\n\nColicchio:  Thanks.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tColicchio – 2 -  PAGE 45\n\n\n\n","description":"One of the byproducts of the food revolution is the increasing respect for chefs. Along with that and the attention to the profession given by the media, a new category has emerged: the Celebrity Chef. No one of them is better-known than Tom Colicchio. Already a highly respected and well-reviewed chef and restaurateur when he became the head judge of the wildly popular television program Top Chef, Colicchio is probably the best-known chef in America.\r\n\r\nAs a young teenager, he started cooking at home, discovered he enjoyed it and worked his way through a swim club food concession, a Burger King, and increasingly more ambitious restaurants in his native New Jersey before heading to Manhattan. His teachers were his on-the-jobs training, the chefs he worked for there and in New York and books, especially Jacques Pepin's on method and technique.\r\n\r\nHe came to wide attention at the Gramercy Tavern in New York's Flatiron district, and then at Craft nearby.\r\n\r\nThe recipient of five James Beard Foundation awards, today Colichio and his cooking can be seen not only at the Craft restaurants (including Craftbar and Craftsteak) in New York, LA, Dallas, and Las Vegas), but also at Colicchio and Sons in Manhattan's Meatpacking District. In 2003, Colicchio and two partners founded the more affordable sandwich and salad outlets, 'wichcraft. In 2010 his work at Craft was honored when the Beard Foundation named him the country's Outstanding Chef.\r\n\r\nColicchio is married to his frequent writing partner, the documentary filmmaker Lori Silverbush.","identifier":"tom-colicchio","label":"Tom Colicchio","url":"/interviews/tom-colicchio/index.html","name":"Tom Colicchio","sort":"colicchio","handle":null},{"@search.action":"upload","content":"Mark Federman's family business is Russ & Daughters on the Lower East Side. TTT\n\nInterviewee:  Mark Federman\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t           New York City\n\nDate:  January 25, 2011\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is January 25, 2011, and I’m with Mark Federman at Russ & Daughters on the Lower East Side.\nGood afternoon.\n\nFederman:  Good afternoon to you.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we start with your telling me a little bit about where and when you were born, who your parents were, get into your education, and, of course, the food you ate.\n\nFederman:  I was born on the Lower East Side and, in fact, a block and a half from here.  I was born on Ludlow Street.  I guess if I’m lucky, I’ll probably die here too.  But it’s different.  My story starts here and my family story starts here on the Lower East Side, although it really starts back on the other side, meaning that part of Eastern Europe which was known as Galitzia, a province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but my grandfather never spoke about that part of his life.  It’s like when he landed here in 1907, he just sort of buried that whole thing.  He was like twenty-one years old.  I assume it’s because life was very difficult.  The Russ family doesn’t come from royalty; we come from poor peasant stock in a shtetl, a little town.\nI’m now in the process of trying to uncover some of that stuff for purposes of writing a book, the Russ & Daughters book.  But at any rate, I asked my mother and my aunt.  There were three Russ daughters, and I’m the son of the youngest Russ daughter, Anne.  There was Hattie, the oldest, she’s alive and she’s about to be ninety-eight; Ida, who died ten years ago at eighty-six; and my mother, Anne, the baby of the Russes, who’s about to be ninety years old.\nSo life really started for him here on the Lower East Side, because he came over here, he was sponsored by a sister who had preceded him here, Chana Russ Ebbin, and she was in the herring business on the Lower East Side.  She had gotten here a few years before him.  The herring business then was basically a couple of barrels of herring and a stall which was usually between two buildings.  People would pass by in the street, and the herring was cheap, maybe two cents, five cents each.  The herring would be picked out of a barrel, wrapped in newspaper, and taken home for a meal, maybe sometimes two meals, meaning one meal, if they were really poor, they would just rub the herring across a piece of bread, and that was a meal, and the second meal was actually the herring.  In the newspaper they’d put potatoes, onions, and stick it in a coal-fire stove and that was a meal.\n\nQ:  Why herring?\n\nFederman:  Herring was plentiful and cheap and it was something they had on the other side, salt-cured fish.  Before refrigeration, how do you preserve foods?  It was by salting or drying, smoking them, curing them, pickling them.  Those were the ways to do it.  And herring was a plentiful food all around the world.  Herring was a food fish around the world, and every culture has some form of herring or some word for herring, although I vouchsafe to say that my grandfather had nothing to do with herring, nor his family over there, but they would have seen herring someplace and probably eaten herring cheap over there too.  Herring basically then came from the north Atlantic, and they were known as schmaltz and schmatzes, German and Yiddish for “fat,” and the fat herrings of the north Atlantic are the best. The fatter fish, the better fish.\n\tSo at any rate, he got here and was sponsored by his sister, and the sponsorship in those days was maybe twenty-five dollars, which represented a lot of herring at maybe a nickel each, but she needed help in her business because she married a guy, Isaac Ebbin, who woke up one day and decided he wanted to be a Talmudic scholar and had no time for running this business, however little ungapatchka business it was, or for the many children he had impregnated in her.  So he then was busy with praying and studying, and she called for the younger brother, Joel, pronounced “Yoel,” but Joel Russ.  There was always a question whether Russ was really the name on other side, and turns out by my research—and I had a genealogist just do this—yes, Russ was the name.  It was not uncommon over there in the province of Galitzia, particularly, and may have referred to people who, generations before, emigrated from Russia back into this area, fleeing the czar’s army.  You’ve heard that story about how the czar’s army, conscription lasted twenty-five years and was basically a death sentence for a Jew because there was no kosher foods being served.  At any rate, that’s sort of the family story.\n\tBut the point is that when he got here, it wasn’t about what happened in the old country; it was about this is a new country, this is a new life.  That’s it.\n\tI was born on Ludlow Street, as I said, above something called, sixty-five years ago, Yavarkovsky Paper Distributing Company, which was there until very recently and was basically a series of little warehouses, one-story warehouses, except that Joseph Yarvakovsky, the founder of this in 18-whatever, at some point one of his children, one of his sons became a dentist, so he built above the warehouse a second floor, and the front was an office for his son the dentist.  So that they should bring in some money since he wasn’t going to charge his son rent, he put an apartment in the back, and so my mother moved us there.  I was born while she was living there.\n\tShe was busy, shortly after I was born, chasing my father around, who was in the service at that point.  This was the very end of World War II.  Then she gave me over for nine months to my father’s mother, who lived in Brooklyn on Empire Avenue not far from Ebbets Field.  I didn’t like that grandmother, and I grew up not to like the Dodgers, so I was a Yankees fan.  [laughter]\n\tSo we lived there some years and then ultimately my grandfather moved the entire family out of the Lower East Side to Far Rockaway, but preceding that, there had been many attempts to get the family out of Lower East Side.  This is a very typical Jewish Lower East Side immigrant story.  This was not a place, the Lower East Side, where you wanted to settle.  It was an awful area.  It was always awful.  In the early 1900s, late 1800s, from 1880 to 1923 is like a million and a half Jews came here to Lower East Side.  There were several million who came.  Some of them wound up in Baltimore, in Galveston, and various ports, but the Lower East Side was the major catch basin until 1923 there was some kind of nativistic law that set a quota so that there would be no more Jews or southern Italians, sort of directed as Eastern European Jews and southern Italians.\n\tSo this was an awful area, and my grandfather made several attempts to get his family out of here.  When he first married, an arranged marriage, he moved to Brooklyn, Myrtle Avenue, and he set up a candy store with his wife, and that lasted a few years.  That was in 1910 he moved out there, and by 1914 he came back to Lower East Side and bought a preexisting smoked-fish store.  “Store” is sort of a grandiose term for whatever it was.  It was like a little space, but the guy who owned it before ran it as a smoked-fish place, and my grandfather took that over and ran it for many years, until in the 1920s he moved his business around the corner to its present location.\n\nQ:  Did your grandmother continue to help at the store?\n\nFederman:  My grandmother was not one for working retail.  Not that she wouldn’t work hard.  She was a peasant lady, very hardworking, apparently a lovely lady, but she was an illiterate and didn’t read nor write English or Yiddish.  My grandfather would at times, in one of the few demonstrations of some tenderness, it was the custom for him to read her something called the Bintel Briefs.  The Bintel Briefs were in The Forward and they were basically Dear Abby kind of things. “My husband ran off.  I’m starving.  What do I do?”  “Dear Reader, do this.”  It’s all in Yiddish, so he would read her that.  But there was never any great show of affection.  She would call him by his last name, Russ, but they pronounced it in the Eastern Europe “Roose,” something like that, and he would call her Zug, which means basically “Hey, you.”  [laughter]  So this was not a love match, but I think it was very typical. \n\tBut anyhow, he would move the family out and then didn’t have much money, move back to the Lower East Side.  The point is, the Lower East Side was a place to get out of.  He finally got the family out, the family meaning his wife and his three daughters, when they were young.  In 1926 he bought a big house in Flatbush on Avenue O.  It was a two-family house with two stories, two kitchens, two of everything, including two mortgages.  He had two mortgages.  So the Crash happened in 1929.  In 1932, two bankers showed up and said, “Mr. Russ, it’s your house or your business.”  By then his business was over here.\nThe family mantra, the family slogan in Yiddish was “Vi remptman parnosa.“ From where do we take our living?”  Basically, “How do we survive?”  This was all a matter of survival.  In those days, there was nothing celebrated, romantic about this kind of business, and there were lots of these appetizing stores on Lower East Side.  They were serving daily needs of the people down here.  There was twenty, thirty.  I mean, there were a lot of them.  Basically they were herring stands and then they had some smoked fish and everything was cheap.  You know, that was life.\n\nQ:  Why were they called appetizing stores?\n\nFederman:  Well, nobody knows the answer to that.  Every five or ten years, The New York Times forgets they’ve asked me this question, and they call me, “Hey, Mark, we want to know.  We have a reader.”  You know that “For Your Information” whatever?  “We have a reader who wants to know why it’s called an appetizing store.”  \nMy stock answer is, nobody knows.  There are various theories.  I was on a panel once with Mimi Sheraton, and she had some explanation that dated to a Spanish thing.  I sort of wonder.  But I’ve never heard that before.  So everybody’s free to make up an explanation.  I don’t know the answer.  But the food is appetizers.  It’s not designed to really be a meal, and it couldn’t be called a delicatessen because the very reason for its existence was to separate it from the stores and delicatessens in which meat was served, since this product was generally served with dairy, cream cheese later on, or butter and whatever, the cream sauce.  So the kosher laws, you couldn’t mix meat and dairy, so this gave rise to this thing.  I don’t know if there were any appetizing stores in Europe.\n\nQ:  Where does the word “appetizing” come from?  Is it meant to be an English word or derived from something else?\n\nFederman:  I have no idea.  I don’t know what the derivation would be.  Delicatessen has a derivation, a French derivation, “delicate eating” or something.\n\nQ:  Sounds like it was created here. \n\nFederman:  Appetizing.  It probably was.  It probably was, and lots of people, I’m sure, would lay claim to being the originator of that, but who knows.  Who put together the bagel, cream cheese, and lox for the first time?  Who knows.  So it’s fair game.\n\tAnyhow, we’re far away from my youth.  Do you want to go back?\n\nQ:  Whatever you—\n\nFederman: I could tell the story of the family, because I’m in the process.  I’m retired now, and what am I doing in my retirement?  I’m thinking about these things and trying to write them down, I mean, what happened to the Russ family.\n\nQ:  We want to get you here.  We don’t want you to sort of pop up.\n\nFederman:  Okay.  So the point is that it was moving out and moving back.  If you had money, you moved out.  From the 1880s to the 1920s or 19-whatever, a lot of Jews, pushcarts in the streets.  You’ve seen pictures of this thing.  According to my Aunt Hattie, you can’t believe how crowded it was.  \nI go to Florida every once in a while to see if I can get my aunt and mother—they’re very smart and very sharp.  They’re not so mobile, but they’re sharp and smart, but they’re not really wanting to remember this stuff because it was not a good life for them, so you’ve got to sort of prod around, and every once in a while you’ll uncover a little thing and they’ll say something, and you realize it’s a gem and get excited.  “What are you interested in that for?”\n\tBut Aunt Hattie says it was awful, and she was born in Brooklyn, 1913.  1914, my grandfather moved them back to Lower East Side and had his wife, my grandmother, and the eldest Russ daughter, the one who was born in 1913, my Aunt Hattie, living in the back of that little store, very dark and dismal and crowded in the streets, terrible.  And then her sister came along, less than two years younger, Ida, the middle daughter.  Then at some point he moved the family from the back of the store across the street, on Orchard Street now, right around the corner here, to a tenement, a fourth-floor apartment, which was a cold-water flat, toilets out in the hallway.  They’d go out on the fire escape for some coolness in the summer, the streets teeming below.\nAunt Hattie remembers that she was put in charge of watching Ida as they were growing up, and Aunt Ida was just uncontrollable, running around the pushcarts in the street, and Aunt Hattie, the oldest, was so worried about her and then would lose her and have to go up to the roofs of the tenements, where Ida would be hiding, and Aunt Hattie would try to scare her, “You’re going to get caught by Jack the Ripper.”  Apparently in those days, there was some fear for these kids.  But nothing stopped Ida.\nMy grandmother was working in the store, but she was an illiterate, she couldn’t read nor write, nor did she have a head for business, and so she would have to ask the customers how much they owed, which was not necessarily good for business.  My grandfather would be out on a horse and wagon delivering smoked fish around to whatever restaurants were around the area, but it turned out that it couldn’t last because his wife just was not capable really of running the business.\nOkay.  So that’s the scene that’s set up, and then he gets them out as far as Corona Queens.  I think the first stop was Williamsburg he moved them to, then maybe had them move to Lower East Side, then to Corona Queens, where my mother, the youngest, is born in 1921, and in 1926 he moves them to the Flatbush house and they lose it in 1932, when they move back to a terrible tenement on the Lower East Side.  I think it was on Second Street, a terrible apartment, and Hattie said it was awful, roach-infested.  She freaked out when she was taking a bath and some giant cockroach jumped in the bath.  They had to get out of there, and my grandfather was able to break the lease because of cousin Sylvia.  Who was cousin Sylvia?\n\nQ:  Who is Sylvia?\n\nFederman:  Sylvia is the daughter of Tante Pepe.  Who’s Tante Pepe?  Tante Pepe, Pepe for Pauline, was the sister of Grandma Russ, Bella Russ, but the two sisters didn’t get along well.  There was some envy there because Pepe had married a barber, whereas Bella had married Joel Russ, who had his own store, but Grandpa Russ, who was known to be very proud and arrogant—that seems to be a trait, actually, that I’ve inherited.  I think it skipped a generation.  [laughter]  At any rate, Grandpa Russ called in the services of Sylvia.  The barber, I think the last name was Peters or Trumpet [phonetic] or whatever, he had lots of kids.  He and Tante Pepe had lots of kids, but he was able to get each one of his kids—this is in the [Great] Depression—a good job in like civil service stuff, using his connections with the people whose hair he was cutting.  So the barber did all right, and cousin Sylvia, his daughter Sylvia, he got a job with the Board of Health or something.  So they call in the services of Sylvia to condemn the roach-infested apartment so they could break the lease.  [laughter]\n\tThey then move the family to—now I’m talking about 1930-something.  They move the family to the Ageloff.   The Ageloff, which was built and opened in 1929 and built and marketed as the luxury building of the Lower East Side, uptown, downtown.  I saw, in looking through some marketing material, they touted—well, according to my mother, they had a doorman with white gloves, they had elevators.  They exist and they’re inhabited.  They’re on Avenue A, basically.  They front on Avenue A from Third Street to Fourth Street, the whole thing.  It’s a huge complex, twelve stories.  All the other buildings in the area were tenements of six stories.  So this was unusual.  I think they had stone lions in the doorway and they had the gloved doorman, they had elevators, they had all of this stuff, so Grandpa Russ moved the family there in probably 1936 or ’37.\n\tWhen I heard this story from my mother and aunt the first time, I said, “How did the Russ family—?”  See, whatever I’ve heard, I have this image of a poor, hardworking immigrant family of fishmongers, herring mongers.  It wasn’t even fancy fish; it was herring mostly, right?  What were they doing in the luxury building of the moment on Lower East Side?\n\nQ:  When you say he moved the family, how much of the family does that mean?\n\nFederman:  Well, that’s the point.  All of the family.  All of the family consisted of Joel Russ and his wife Bella, my grandparents, their three daughters, Hattie, Ida, and Anne.  Two of the daughters by this point, Hattie and Ida, had gotten married, so their husbands were in there, Murray and Max.  They also had gotten pregnant and given birth quickly, so the babies were in there, Nina and Lolly, and the two maids, they say.  I said, “What?  We had maids?”  And the response is, how much could it cost in those days?  A maid was like fifteen dollars a month and they were happy to work.\nSo they had two maids, because Mama was busy taking care of the kids because the Russ girls worked in their father’s store, and shopping and cleaning and whatever.  They had two maids.  One was from Czechoslovakia and Mama was able to communicate with her in some Slavic tongue.  The other was from the Deep South and spoke English, except nobody was able to understand her.\nIn the Ageloff, they had this group of people—and we’ll count up how many; I forget—this group living in a two-bedroom apartment with one bathroom.  So one bedroom was Grandma and Grandpa Russ.  The other bedroom was, I think, Ida and Max.  The living room became the bedroom of Hattie and Murray.  The dining room became the bedroom of my mother and the two maids and the babies, or the babies may have been with their parents.  That’s how the Russ family was able to live in the hoo-hah fancy-schmancy building on the Lower East Side and have maids.  And they only had to walk from Third Street and Avenue A, or Fourth Street, over here to Houston Street.\nNow, this is during the Depression.  “How bad were things in the Depression?” I asked.  I said, “Would you consider yourself poor?”\n“No.  Everybody was in the same boat.  We always had what to eat.”\n\nQ:  What about the sisters working in the store?  How unusual was that or ordinary?\n\nFederman:  Totally unusual, totally.  Then by 1936, my grandfather—the store had been known as J. Russ Cut-Rate Appetizers.  I said to Aunt Hattie, “Was that the name?”\n\t“Yeah.”\n\t“Why was it called Cut-Rate?”\n\tAunt Hattie said, “I have no idea.  Everything was so cheap in those days, what rate could they cut?”  And two doors away was another appetizing store, H. Eisenberg Cut-Rate Appetizers.  It turns out that little anecdote is that Harry Eisenberg worked for my grandfather for some years, but he was religious.  My grandfather was not.  Harry Eisenberg, the deal they had was that Harry Eisenberg—my grandfather would work on Saturday and Harry would be off.  My grandfather would then take off on Sunday and Harry would work.  Then they would, I guess, work together during the week.  So that was the arrangement until, as I understand—I just spoke to Harry Eisenberg’s son, who I know, Murray, who’s in Florida, retired, way in his eighties—apparently my grandfather, Joel Russ, asked Harry to come in on Saturday nights after Shabbat was over, and Harry lived in the Bronx, so that he should take care of the trade that was coming in, the after-theater crowd from the Yiddish theater that existed along this whole area here, Second Avenue, mostly.  And Harry refused.  \nThat was the end of that relationship, and Harry opened two doors to the left or right, depending on which way you’re—but according to my aunt, Harry really couldn’t compete.  He didn’t have the same merchandise and he didn’t have the three pretty daughters selling the stuff, but he lasted some years, not too many.  Then I think he went to work for Scotty’s or somebody, another appetizing store in the neighborhood.\n\tSo the deal with the women was not usual, and the concept of calling it something & Daughters, Russ & Daughters, was definitely unusual.  There are those who ask me sort of rhetorically, “So your grandfather was an early feminist or women liberationist.”\n\tI say, “You don’t know my grandfather.  Definitely not.”  But if anything, he had a business sense, and he knew of all the twenty or thirty appetizing stores here, they would have over the door somebody Cohen or, Saperstein & Sons.  Nobody had “& Daughters,” and he had three pretty daughters and they were starting to get married, and he wanted Russ & Daughters.  It didn’t say Russ & Daughters & Sons-in-law.  It was Russ & Daughters.  So that’s what happened.  Their husbands ultimately became partners, but it would never be called anything other than Russ & Daughters, and he was very proud of that.\nIt also was sort of a recognition of a business necessity.  My grandfather was, I suspect, a typical Eastern European self-taught hardworking survivalist to the Lower East Side, and in that, he wasn’t long on patience.  I’ve inherited that also.  So if they gave him a hard time, which typical customers here do, “I don’t want that one.  What do you think, I’m a greenhorn?  You want to give me that?  Go in the back and get me—no, don’t try to give me that one.”  And if they did that to my grandfather, his response in Yiddish—and I haven’t gotten the Yiddish translation—was to the effect of, “Lady, do me a favor.  Lose my address.”  [laughter]  But this is not a great attitude if you’re in retail.\nFortunately, he had three pretty young daughters who started working when—I think Aunt Hattie, when she was eleven, and Aunt Hattie never finished high school.  Ida was allowed to finish high school and my mother, too, but it was clear that they would be coming into the business.  So they started as young girls on the weekends, and then when they finished school or dropped out, they worked full-time.  They were able to charm and disarm the crowd, the toughest customer, and the customers here in those days were tough, and it was shopping as a cross between an art form and an act of war.  You weren’t going to put anything past these customers.  They’d watch you, make sure all your fingers were off the scale.\nWhen I came in in the beginning of 1978, which is long past all of this, I inherited still some of those customers and there are anecdotes about some of these that I remember.  This kind of customer really doesn’t exist anymore, but it’s something I grew up with, and even before that would hear stories about this one and that one.  It’s something that I actually miss now.  These were customers that wanted not even a quarter, but a halb a fertl, half a quarter, an eighth of a pound of lox, and at the same time wanted your kishkes, your insides, on the scale at no extra charge in the package, right?\nSo it was a constant challenge to deal with this when I came in.  It was also me being puffed up and being a lawyer.  I practiced law for a number of years, and here I was, and they were going to try this, and I was going to let them know I was a lawyer.  Well, that didn’t work.  They couldn’t care less if I was a lawyer behind the counter, there was something wrong with me.  “What happened, you failed?”  [laughter]\nBut I miss that kind of customer.  Now what you find is--because we’re somewhat celebrated because we’re still around.  If for no other reason, we’re around.  And this kind of business is not around anymore.  It’s too hard.  Why would you do this kind of thing?  This is not a good business model.  It’s labor-intensive, it’s a product that’s very expensive to us and finicky.  It’s a labor force that doesn’t exist; you have to create it.  Then once you create it, you’ve created prima donnas.  This does not make sense as a business model of an appetizing store anymore, so you don’t see any new appetizing stores anymore, really.\nWhere was I?  But now because we’ve been around so long and dedicated to our business, we’re dedicated to our customers, to our product, and we [unclear] to that, every piece of fish, every customer, whatever, we got caught up in this whole celebration of food.  I don’t know when that started, in the eighties or nineties, Food Network, Food Channel, food this, Hot Chefs, Star Chefs, whatever.  The food world got like Hollywood, and somebody must have said, “Hey, look at Russ & Daughters.  They’re cool.”  And once somebody says that, everybody says that, and then all of a sudden you have this aura about you, whereas to us, the Russ family, we’re still the herring mongers on the Lower East Side, dedicated to our products.  But now they come in, the customers, and they thank you.  Whoever heard of a Jewish customer thanking you for waiting on him?  It was like somebody was doing somebody else a favor.\n\nQ:  Which you are.\n\nFederman:  Right.  So they thank you.  They wait.  If you’re here before a holiday, used to be before Yom Kippur, the break fast, the place is crowded.  Now, that’s an ugly scene.  We can get into this later, but that’s like thousands of Jews have a headache in advance, thinking about not eating for twenty-four hours.  They’re not in a good mood.  Then there are always those that feel sort of entitled, a celebrity.  “I’ve been shopping here since your grandma.  What, me take a number?  What is that?  I should take a number?”  [laughter]\n\nQ:  When did you come along?\n\nFederman:  I came along September 2, 1945.  I was actually born in Beth Israel Hospital, but we lived over here above Yavarkovsky Paper Company.  Remind me at some point to tell you the story of Yarvakovsky and my grandfather.  But I was born then.  Then within about four or five years, my grandfather had finally gotten us out of Lower East Side, he expected for good, and it was, to Far Rockaway, moved the whole family.  He was constantly moving the family and never telling anybody.  We would come home and we’re moving.  Wouldn’t tell his wife, wouldn’t tell anybody.  Made a decision—this is my grandfather—“We’re moving.”  And so they picked up and he moved everybody out to Far Rockaway, and that’s basically where I grew up till I went off to college, which was a very lovely insular Jewish, mostly Jewish community.  You know where Far Rockaway is on the peninsula?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFederman:  And in those days it was quite lovely.  As a kid growing up, you get on your bike and go anyplace, the bay, the beach, whatever.\n\nQ:  Did the whole family go out there?\n\nFederman:  Yes, the whole family did.  By then, the middle daughter had left the family, left the business, she and her husband.  It’s never quite clear whether she was fired by my grandfather or she quit, but it’s clear they didn’t get along.  The irony here, jumping way ahead, is that there’s a family plot at Beth David Cemetery, the Russ family plot, he bought twenty-nine gravesites, so his children and their husbands and the grandchildren and husbands and wives, and it’s on a corner, a corner plot.  This was real estate.  A lot of the old Jews came over, it was about real estate; they bought some property here on Lower East Side, whatever.  But this was a piece of real estate and twenty-nine gravesites, with a big oak tree and a stone bench.  “You should come, bring some food, sit down, have a visit.”  [laughs]  Aunt Ida, who’s the first Russ daughter to die in 2001, got buried.  Joel Russ and Bella Russ, they are there, 1959, 1962, I think.  But then Ida Russ Schwartz [phonetic], the middle aunt, died in 2001, she’s buried right next to her father, and they fought all of the time.  I think there’s something ironic about that.\n\nQ:  What were your expectations for yourself when you were going to high school?\n\nFederman:  Well, for myself or expectations for me?  They’re two different things.  What I was going to tell you is, just to relate my youth to our business here, so we moved out and the concept was to get out of Lower East Side and into suburban life.  It was post war America and New York and everybody was moving someplace, buying houses.  Levittowns were being built and whatever.  That was the dream, right?  So my grandfather picked Far Rockaway by the sea.  Maybe he wanted to be by water and fish.  Who knows why he did.  But it was a schlep to get into the city, so we moved out to get away from the Lower East Side, but it occurred to me at some point, maybe I was six or seven or eight, that we really brought the Lower East Side with us, and we did it by virtue of the smells that we brought, so that working in the store, my grandparents, my parents, my aunts and uncles, we all had a particular smell of this smokiness and fishiness and whatever, and you couldn’t help it.  You were around it all day long.  \nWe thought every house had a herring closet.  I was surprised to find out that there isn’t a herring closet; it was just our family.  So when they came home from work, there would be a vestibule area, and you’d take off your smelly outer clothes so you wouldn’t bring it into the house.  They assumed it didn’t go into the house.  Of course, it did.  So, you know, it was clear, by virtue of the smell, that we were different, because our house smelled different and our parents smelled different.  No matter how many baths and how much cologne, we smelled differently than everybody else.\nThere’s other differences that I realized growing up, and someday I should discuss this with my sisters, to just see what their impressions were, is that everybody else’s parents, their fathers, mostly it was fathers working and mothers not, but their fathers would go to work, put on ties and jackets and whatever, they were teaching, they were this, maybe they had some business, they got dressed up, they smelled nice, they went to work, they came back, they commuted, and they worked five days a week, generally, and they were off on the weekends to do fun things with the family.  They’d go to Coney Island or they’d go whatever, Yankee Stadium, you know, whatever families do together.\nMy family worked on the weekends, and not just my father.  Now on the weekends the Russ daughters were given dispensation where they did not have to work during the week when they had children.  That was their sort of exit plan out of the business.  But on the weekends they would still have to work when it was busier.  They would sort of rotate shifts and stuff.  So now on the weekends, I don’t have a father or mother.  We’re taken care of, myself and my two sisters—I have an older sister and a younger sister—by my grandmother, my father’s mother, who I told you about, who was five foot high and five foot wide, and had the mouth of a tugboat captain and chain-smoked Pall Mall and was the worst possible cook imaginable.  This is not your sweet cuddly grandmother image.  And would chase me around the house with a knife.  She was like awful, scary, was a scary woman.  So she raised us on the weekends.  And all my friends were, like, terrorized by her too.  She would say, “Go play on your own block.”  They all lived on the block.  Everybody was intimidated.\nSo we were different there, because that was our weekend, and the day off, my father’s day off, they worked six days a week, and at this point they were commuting from Far Rockaway into the Lower East Side, which would take an hour each way, at least.  My father had one day off. \n\n[Telephone interruption]\n\n[Begin File 2]\n\nQ:  Go ahead.  So, from PS 104.\n\nFederman:  Right.  Benjamin Cardoza Junior High, which was the first experience being bused out of this little insular community of Far Rockaway, particularly Bayswater [phonetic], to this junior high school I think was newly built in the middle of the peninsula, so it got fed from the more affluent Jewish community of Belle Harbor and Neponset, and then the Far Rockaway community fed into this junior high school, but so did the not-so-nice neighborhoods, the Irish gangs from Rockaway Park and the Italian gangs from wherever they were, and the blacks.  All of a sudden there were blacks in the mix.  So junior high school is a weird period for people anyhow, I guess, for kids that age, of transition from whatever, pre-teen into teen, and then you throw us into the mix with all sorts of people we didn’t know about and it was suddenly scary, and then I got into fights.  It was not a great time.\n\tBut I also was part of this program they called SP. New York had this program, they were allegedly giving a test and identifying kids a little more bright than the others, so that they could segregate them and skip a grade, so I skipped a grade.\nThen I moved generally with this group of kids into high school, Far Rockaway High School.  I went to Far Rockaway High School, which was walking distance from the house, and I had my first girlfriend my senior year.  It was pretty good.  Looking back on it, I don’t recall now what particular emotions I had.  It seemed to me I was having a nice sort of childhood. \nWhat’s sort of significant was that we were required, from the time we were thirteen, “we” meaning myself, my sisters, my cousins, were required to go in and help out in the store on the weekends, so Saturday and Sunday, on a rotating basis.  So one would do it on Saturday and a Sunday, then another.  There were five of us to draw from, but by this point the middle sister and her kids were out.  So it was basically five of us to rotate, and nobody really wanted to work.  By this time I was thirteen, so my older cousin was twenty-one, married, and she was out.  So there were basically four of us.\n\nQ:  Were you taught how to slice fish?\n\nFederman:  No, no, no.  We were not allowed to work behind the fish counter, where there were sharp knives and it was all very active, hectic, and knives happening and fish happening, and you had to know what you were doing.  You could make or lose money, and nobody wanted to buy fish from a kid, which started to get a little more expensive.  We’re talking about in the 1950s.  So they didn’t want to see a kid behind a fish counter.  But there was a candy counter.  At some point my grandfather bought this building, the store.  I have pictures downstairs which show the original store here was half of its size, and the same address was shared by a little commission bakery to the left when my grandfather bought the building. Ultimately the people who had that Little Commission Bakery left and he was able to widen his store, so what was that little bakery store or stall is now our candy side.\n\tNow, why candy?  You know, I think about this.  I asked questions.  I have no idea why it became a candy side in an appetizing store.  You know, the theory is, we’re going to eat salty, fishy whatever, they needed candy, and it wasn’t just candy then.  The candies were primarily hard candies because every Jew of a certain age, usually older, always had hard candies in their pockets.  I don’t know if you grew up the same way.  My grandfather always had hard candies in his pockets, and usually one of several kinds.  There was a mint, I guess for the breath, or there was Hopjes.  I don’t know if you know Hopjes.  Hopjes, we still sell those.  It’s from actually Holland, made by Rademaker, and it’s a cube made out of coffee flavor.  It’s a coffee-flavored cube, and it was a favorite.  Then there was the honey sesame candies that were wrapped in cellophane.  The problem is they kept them in their pockets too long, they got sticky.  But always some kind of hard candy elderly Jews had, that they would eat themselves.  Maybe ate a lot of onions and garlic, maybe to kill that.  Or to give out to kids as treats.  The grandchildren always got some. \n\tAt any rate, most of the appetizing stores had candy being sold to them, so that other side became the candy side, had its own counter, its own scale.  I remember working there.  The scale was a balance scale, so you’d put the weights, which were quarter pound, half pound, one pound, two pound.  If you wanted five pounds, you’d have two two-pounds and one one-pound on one side, and the other side was this big sort of stainless steel scoopy thing where you put the candy, scoop it from a bin into there, and then there was this sort of needle that moved back and forth.  When it was directly in the middle, you had the right weight, because it balanced.  Then you would take that scoop and open a bag up.  Generally in those days it was a brown bag, and hopefully you’d get it all in the bag, and that was the sale.  Of course, the customers in those days would not accept right in the middle.  You had to give them an extra one so it was good weight.  When they said, “That’s good weight,” you knew you were going to be in trouble with your parents or aunts and uncles or something because you gave too much.\nBut we had to do that on the weekend.  We didn’t do it willingly.  They had insulated us, my parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles.  They had insulated our generation.  Here’s how I see it.  The concept was not to groom us to come into this business.  They had to do it.  My grandparents did it as survival, right?  They came over here and this is what they were going to do.  My grandfather brought his three daughters into the business for survival.  He didn’t have any sons and he didn’t do well with hired help.  At various times he had a nephew working, had his brother who came over.  None of that worked out well.\nSo his daughters were expected to come in, not to go to college.  That wasn’t an issue.  There was no expectation they were going to school.  They would come in and help out, and when they got married, he had sort of the right of first refusal.  Whoever they were dating, they didn’t have to see a matchmaker, it wasn’t going to be an arranged marriage like what happened to him, but he would size them up and I guess he’d say to himself, “This one can schlep a herring barrel, can slice lox and look good behind the counter and add up a figure of numbers on a brown bag with a pencil.”  So their husbands came into the business, and it’s all during the Depression.  So to be able to work in a store was, you know, some sense of security.  \nMy aunt tells me that she and her husband were the first—she was the eldest daughter.  She worked, her husband worked with her, and they were paid by my grandfather and they started in 1935, I guess, in the store.  They were paid twenty-five dollars a week for both of them, for six days a week, eight-, ten-, twelve-hours a day, but that was it.  He gave them a place to live in their apartment in the Ageloff and gave them what food to eat.\nBut nobody questioned anything, and nobody would question my grandfather.  That became clear to me as I’m trying to figure this guy out.  I knew him because I was sixteen or seventeen when he died.  This was also not a warm and cuddly figure.  He was sort of a stern bearing, and if you asked him a question that he wanted to answer, he would say, in his heavy European accent, “Ask me.  I’ll ‘splain you.”  “Ask me.  I’ll ‘splain you.”  Well, that set up the whole dynamic.  He was going ‘splain things to you and he was going to tell you.  That was it.  And he also—I mean, I’m getting this as I’m asking people questions, including his daughters—he was arrogant.  “Arrogant” may be too lofty a term.  He thought he was better than most other people.\nThere’s a whole anecdote I won’t go into now, but Rose Yavarkovsky, the daughter-in-law of Yavarkovsky, the paper goods guy, whatever, Rose is sort of an interesting case, since she is the daughter of a pushcart peddler who had a pushcart in front of the store, our store.  She wound up marrying Sol, one of the sons of Joseph Yavarkovsky, the paper dealer who had this basically on Ludlow, so everybody was talking, hoo-haw, how the peddler’s daughter had married up.  [laughter]  Rose Yarvakovsky worked until recently way into her nineties.  My Aunt Hattie says, “Rose is older than I am, though she won’t admit it, and I’m going to be ninety-eight.”  So I know until a few years ago, Rose would work every day—recently in the winter she would go to Florida—standing out front of her door on Ludlow Street with a mink coat and a clipboard, checking in the stuff from the big trailers of paper goods that would be dropped off, and then checking out the little vans of the jobbers who would take it, standing out there in the cold and whatever, doing it.\nRose Yarvakovsky told the story—and some day I’ll tell it to you, but the story basically winds up with Joel Russ was shtolt.  That was the word they used, shtolt, meaning proud but a pride born of arrogance.  Joel Russ thought he was better.  Even his daughter, who said yes to everything, “Yes, Papa, yes, Papa,” Hattie, the eldest daughter, knew—I said, “Were you friendly with the people on the block, the other stores?”\n“No, we kept to ourselves,” she said.\nI said, “Why is that?”\n“My father didn’t mingle.  He thought he was better than everybody else.”  So that was it.  And “what he said, what Papa said, that was it.  Nobody asked questions.”\nLet me know if I’m too far afield, because one thing leads to another.  But I just want to say that in the store, if you go into the store, you will see around, above the shelves, this—maybe you call it a soffit or something, which is made out of smoked white glass and it has black hand-lettered writing on it, each section of it.  This was done when my grandfather renovated the store and the shelving, whatever.  Each section has a name with something that was sold in the store, so it will say Nova Scotia, it will say Caviar or something.  It’ll say Sturgeon, whatever.  The very first section, the soffit there, this section looks out into the street, so this is what people would see if they were walking by, the very first one says Smoked Eel.\n\nQ:  Huh.\n\nFederman:  Right.  Until somebody asked me, I didn’t know, and I’m working here since I’m a kid, right?  I didn’t know it said that, or didn’t register.  So somebody said, “Why?”\n\tI said, “I don’t know, but I’m going to ask my mother and aunt.”  This was some years ago.\nSo I went and asked them, “Why does it say Smoked Eel?”\n“It says what?”  [laughter]\n“It says Smoked Eel.”\n“I don’t know.”\nI said, “Did you ever sell smoked eel?”\nAnd they said, “Yeah, but it was always in the back.  We never had it showcased,” and I know that because even when I came along, for Christmas and New Year’s the non-Jew Eastern European liked to eat smoked eel, and actually it’s quite good but it’s very ugly.  Jews don’t eat smoked eel not only because it’s not kosher, it’s because it’s ugly.  It’s like a snake.  They’re not going to eat it.  So we sold very little of it.  We sold only a few a year and only a certain time of year, and it was kept in the back.  So why then does the very first soffit, the one that everybody sees going by even out in the street, say Smoke Eel?  I asked my mother.  One, it just didn’t occur to them, and, two, if they knew it, they wouldn’t have asked their father. “ If Papa wanted it that way, he must have had his reasons.” “Shoyn, fartig” that’s it.\n\nQ:  Was he still around working in the store when you started working here?\n\nFederman:  I started working in—my bar mitzvah, so it was ’58.  He died in ’62.  He would come and go.  His retirement was putzing around with his garden in Far Rockaway, making some kind of wine out of raisins or cherries, sour cherries, making a syrup out of roses, and until my grandmother died in ’59, he was sort of shepherding her because she was sickly.  The move from Brooklyn back to the Lower East Side, once she got to Brooklyn in the two-family house with the big garden where she could plant things, she suddenly felt comfortable in America.  She was a poor peasant farmer.  When she had to move back, it broke her spirit and she never recovered from that.  So she was sickly after that.  I don’t know if he felt guilty, but he was more attentive in some respects, as attentive as he could be.\n\tSo he wasn’t really in the store, but before I came in, and when he retired, which is basically around 1950 or so, and he had all his daughters and sons-in-law in place, he’d basically take this old cracked leather chair that he had in his little office in the back.  I don’t know if you saw the office that’s back there.  It’s like the size of a bathroom.  Take his chair out and put it near the candy side, and now he would dress up in fancy suits, he had a cane because he had a problem with his foot, with like a gold handle or silver handle, and he would sit out in front.  He had a portrait made of himself, which had hung in the store, and he would sit under this portrait and he would point with his cane, I understood this from my mother and aunt, point to something and say, “Nicht a zoi” meaning, “Not like that.”  This was not a guy for compliments.  He would just tell you what not to do.  “Nicht a zoi.” \nSo he would come in by subway also from Far Rockaway, which is a major schlep, but to do that, to feel sort of busy or whatever.  So that’s it.\n\nQ:  So when you graduated from high school, then what happened?\n\nFederman:  Then the question was where to go to college.  Most of my friends were going locally to, like, Brooklyn or Queens or whatever it was, Brooklyn mostly in those days, and I decided I wanted to go out of town, and that may have been, now that I’m thinking about it, to escape the requirement of working in the store on the weekends and on holidays, which we were required to do.\nIn those days, what happened here is you had a guidance counselor in high school, and the guidance counselor would tell you three choices and those were the schools you applied to, unless you had a burning desire to go someplace you thought you’d get into.  So this guidance counselor I remember very well, Miss Kraft, who had a face like one of those apple people that gets all shriveled up.  It’s the only face I can remember from my teachers in high school.  Miss Kraft decided that the three choices for me were George Washington University, Alfred University upstate, and Grinnell College in Iowa.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nFederman:  And the only one I’d heard of is George Washington, but I decided I would make the rounds to see, so I went with my father.  He went with me to George Washington, and we went by plane.  It may have been the first time I was on a plane.  It was a bad, bumpy ride, so I ruled out George Washington.\nI went by myself then to Grinnell.  I had skipped a grade, so at the time I was looking, I was going to be fifteen and a half, and I got on a plane and I flew to Des Moines, Iowa.  Then I got on a bus for two hours in the flattest, ugliest land you’d ever see, and I got to Grinnell and I didn’t know anything about this place.  Then they assign you to some kid, a student who’s going to show you around and be your mentor for the weekend, and this kid is busy telling me how the townies like to beat up on the freshmen.  [laughter]  Then the sky opens, which apparently is not unusual, and thirty inches of snow came out of nowhere and fell down, and I decided I had to get out of there.  So I didn’t wait.  This all happened within twenty-four hours.  So I hitched a ride in to the Des Moines Airport, waited for the sky to clear, and took off.  I never told anybody, and I don’t think anybody missed me.  I was out of there.\nSo the school I hadn’t seen, the one that was left, was Alfred, so I said, “I’m going there.”  They offered me some kind of scholarship.  So I went to Alfred, sight unseen, and spent four very happy years.  It was a lovely cloistered kind of community.  I guess things were going on then, like maybe a sexual revolution and a drug thing.  Somehow that passed me by.  I wanted it, but—\n\nQ:  It didn’t get to Alfred.  [laughter]\n\nFederman:  It certainly didn’t get to me in Alfred.  So I spent four years there.  What’s of some significance is that Alfred was a land-grant school, and so ROTC was required for the first two years for the men.  So the two years, instead of gym, you put on a uniform and you spit-shined your shoes and polished your brass and stood in some kind of formation and pretended you were playing whatever, just to march around, got a haircut.  But what’s interesting, and I’ve never been able to really put my finger on why I did this, I volunteered to continue the second two years, and this was totally voluntary, and just a few guys did it.  I would suspect it had something to do with this John Wayne syndrome of putting on a uniform, playing soldier, getting the girls or whatever.  There was nothing dangerous happening in the world really at that time.\n\nQ:  Two years after college or an additional two years in college?\n\nFederman:  In college.  So I did that, and as it turns out, on graduation we went through the regular graduation, cap and gown, my parents came up, and it was the first time they had seen the school.  They came up for it, and after the regular graduation, we took off the cap and gown, and I and several of my classmates had uniforms underneath and we got commissioned as second lieutenants in the United States Army.  The problem was then, this was 1966 and Vietnam was starting to heat up, and so it was too late.  There were no backsies on this thing then.  But what I did do is get a deferral to go to law school.\n\nQ:  How did it happen that you were interested in law school?\n\nFederman:  By default.  What does a Jewish boy do who’s relatively successful as a student, and what is expected of you?  It certainly was expected we would come in the fish business.  That’s why they were all working so hard, so that we wouldn’t have to work like that and sell fish and smell like fish.  So I was probably the most successful, in academics, of my cousins and sisters, and so the question is me going on to grad school, and there was some thought of me going on for an M.A./Ph.D. in political science.  I was offered some program that was nice, but for whatever reason I can’t tell you, I think what happens is Jewish boys who can’t become or don’t want to become doctors or dentists or whatever, law is the next best thing.\n\tSo I picked law, and I got into Georgetown Law School and NYU [New York University], and I decided to pick Georgetown just because it was out of town.  Again, if you’re in town, you’re still part of the family, the Russ family, and you still have to work.  Remind me later to tell you what I’ve done to my kids to continue that tradition.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  This kept you out of the army?\n\nFederman:  No.  Deferred me.  So I was in law school for three years, from ’66 to ’69, living in Washington, D.C., in three different places in three different years.  I was there in 1968 when they burned down Washington during the riots.  You were there then, I presume, too, or you were out of town by then?\n\nQ:  No, I was here, actually.\n\nFederman:  Okay.  So we switched.  But I was there.  Because your family was there, I’m sure you’ve heard stories about that period.\n\tAt any rate, I didn’t have anything to do with the military.  I didn’t have a uniform, I didn’t have anything.  I forgot about it.  Then you finish, graduated law school, Georgetown, and seemed to me within a few days I got a notice, “Report for duty.”  Then I went on a trip to Europe—I hadn’t been there—with some friends, gadding around Europe.  You could do Europe on five dollars a day.  You remember the book?  It was Frommer or somebody, and you could do it and have change.  So we did that.\nThen I came and I just had no choice, because for me not to show up would have been desertion, right?  So I had done this thing to myself.  So the army had a plan.  I had a two-year obligation, and the army’s plan for me for the two years was the first year in Fort Polk, Louisiana.  Fort Polk, Louisiana, famous for large mosquitoes, large alligators, and larger rednecks.  None of those seemed exciting to me.  Then the second year they were going to send me to Vietnam.  By this point, we’re talking about 1969, it was quite hot.  It was right after ’68, the Tet [Offensive], Saigon was overrun.  So that was their plan for me, they told me, as if offering me, I don’t know, a Caribbean vacation.  “Here’s what we have planned for you.”\nI said, “Now, wait a minute.  We must be able to do something else.  Let’s discuss this.”\nThey said, “Well, actually, there is something we can do.  If you extend your obligation by a year, make it three instead of two, you can go for the first eighteen months anyplace in the world you want to go where we have an opening, and the next eighteen months we’ll send you anyplace we want to send you.”  I assumed that was going to be Vietnam anyhow, so I would put it off.\nSo I picked that option.  I picked for the first eighteen months San Francisco because I had a cousin living there that I liked.  I don’t know.  I didn’t want to learn a foreign language or whatever.\nSo I got to San Francisco in ’69 and I was assigned to Oakland Army Terminal on the other side of the Oakland Bay Bridge, and at the moment I showed up—this is what Jews call bashert.--the moment I showed up, they had no vacancies in the quarters on the base for officers.  I was a first lieutenant at the time.  So they gave me a stipend to go find my own apartment, which I did, across the street from my cousin in San Francisco.  I bought a car, I had an apartment, and every day I’d put on a uniform, drive over the Bay Bridge to work.  I had got assigned to the JAG office because I was a lawyer at this time, the Judge Advocate General’s Office, so I was, in effect, practicing law.  I’d drive home and take off the uniform, go across the street to hang out with my cousin and smoke some pot.  It was okay, not bad.\nEighteen months came and I’m ready for the letter in the mail.  Didn’t happen.  Nineteen months, twenty months, twenty-one.  I’m saying, “Shit, they forgot about me.  Thank goodness I’m here in San Francisco.”  But twenty-four months, basically, they located me and gave me orders to Vietnam.\nSo there I am with orders to Vietnam and I really didn’t want to go.  Didn’t seem to be a great prospect.  Lots of people were dying.  So my father had a customer or I’m not quite sure the connection, some customer who knew somebody, or may have been the guy himself, who was the head of something in New York, and he was a colonel and whatever, and the idea was for me to go and see him, to get out of going to Vietnam.  So normally I rejected my father’s offers of help in these things, but we’re talking about Vietnam, so I went.  The guy—I remember it—was busy telling me what an honor it was to go to Vietnam, and I’m sitting there in some Kafkaesque scene.  I left there, like, nauseous—I’m getting nauseous thinking about it now—knowing there’s no escape for me.\nI’m deaf in one ear, I was born deaf in one ear, and I thought maybe that would do something, so I tried to get out by virtue of that, and they said, “Oh, man, you’re a lawyer.  You’re going to be in Saigon.  You don’t have to hear anything.  Don’t worry about it.  Everything’ll be fine.”\nSo I took off in a plane with a bunch of other soldiers from McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, and this was in 1971, and flew to Anchorage, Alaska, to Yokota, Japan, to Bien Hoa Air Force Base outside of Saigon.  Okay.  You’re sort of adrenalized and it’s all different and whatever.  At this point I’m a captain, so I can’t start crying because I’m a captain, right?\n\nQ:  A captain in JAG?\n\nFederman:  No.  My assigned branch was AG, the Adjutant General, but I get assigned to JAG because I’m a lawyer.  They always need lawyers.\n\tSo I show up wherever I’m supposed to show up, and hand my papers and say, “Okay, I’m ready for JAG assignment in Saigon,” and it looks like it might be interesting.  And they decided that they needed an adjutant general—I was an administrative officer—in an advisory team in the Mekong Delta.  The last one got blown up on his Jeep, you know, sort of like one of these IEDs today.  I said, “You don’t want to do this to me.  I’m a lawyer.”\n\t“We don’t need lawyers now.  We need an AG.”\n\tSo the next thing I knew, they put me on a plane and our first stop was someplace called Cantho in the Mekong Delta, the headquarters of whatever army that was, 4th Army, whatever, in the Mekong Delta, and I was there for a while.  Now what I’m remembering is how terribly afraid I was.  Couldn’t believe I was in this scene.  This had never crossed my expectation radar.  And I was so vulnerable then.\n\tThey also had, which is strange, like out of a Fellini movie, a bunch of people floating around that were Jews for Jesus, trying to convert.  There weren’t that many Jews around, but they were Jesus freaks and were trying to convert people.\n\nQ:  In the army?\n\nFederman:  Yes, because if you’re going to die, you might as well die believing in Jesus and then the Rapture and whatever.  But I was so screwed up and vulnerable then, that they sort of had me on the ropes, and I might have gone that way except that I got shipped out just before I was ready to say, “Okay, take me, Jesus.”\n\tThen they shipped me out to—they put me on this big supply plane, I don’t know what you call it, C-something, the back opens up and they drive tanks into it, but all they put on that plane was me and some mail, sitting in this thing.  I don’t know, maybe we flew an hour, and it lands and the thing opens up again, and I’m in the middle of a rice paddy with some single strip of corrugated metal that the plane landed on.  I get out and the mail gets thrown out, and the thing closes up and takes off.  And there I am, thinking to myself, “What’s a nice Jewish boy like me doing in a place like this?”\n\tThen a guy comes up in a Jeep, sort of a hippie-type guy, and he says—he doesn’t say anything.  I say, “Oh, you’re here to pick me up?”\n\tHe said, “I’m here to pick up the mail.”\n\tI said, “Well, I’m assigned to the advisory team.”  That’s the only thing down there, so they took me there, and I was there just for a couple of months in the middle of nowhere.  Then they decided they needed a lawyer in Saigon, so they transferred me back for the remainder.  So that was the war.\n\nQ:  After Saigon, then what happened?\n\nFederman:  I came back to the States.  I was discharged from the army, and I’m sure you’ve heard the guys who came back, there were no bands playing for us.  Basically, took off the uniform, threw everything away.  You didn’t want to go around saying you just came back from Vietnam or even that you were in the army, because at that point you were recognized as something, a baby killer, not that I ever shot anybody, nobody ever shot at me, but it wasn’t a good scene.\n\tSo then the question was for me to figure out what to do with my life, and I started to get a little frayed.\n\nQ:  Where were you?\n\nFederman:  I was living at home with my parents in Far Rockaway then, in their house.  I started to get a little not so lucid, so I decided I needed a job right away, so I got a job.  At this point I had taken the bar in New York and passed it before I even went into the army, and when I was stationed in San Francisco I took the bar in California and I passed that, so I had two places, but I had a girlfriend, a longstanding girlfriend at the time in New York, so I decided to stay here.  I got a job here right way with Legal Aid in Brooklyn.  That lasted about eight months.  It was Legal Aid Family Court.  I didn’t like it at all.\nThen they opened up at that point a brand-new office, a prosecutorial office called the Office of the Special Prosecutor for the State of New York, and a guy who became somewhat famous/infamous, Maurice Nadjari.  The concept there, that whole office grew out of the Serpico—you know Serpico.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFederman:  So Serpico had blown the whistle, and as a result, they had hearings before a federal judge, called the Knapp Commission hearings, and as a result of all that, then Governor Rockefeller set up a commission to investigation corruption in the criminal justice system in New York.  Nadjari was named the head of it, and he was putting together a team of young aggressive prosecutors.  I was a defense lawyer for Legal Aid, but somehow I got that job.  For five years I was with that office, and it was somewhat exciting.  We were doing what we thought was good work.\n\tThen I decided I had to make some money because I was married.  I went to a private firm, a litigating firm uptown, and I did that for two years.  At this point I had two children.\nSo the question always is, and it’s a question I ask myself, why did I leave law?  I was doing relatively well in it, making some money, was on the right track.  Why did I leave that and come back into the family business?  And I do not have a good answer for that.  I don’t.  What’s clear is that practicing law wasn’t pleasing me that much, and I’d come home with an armful of files that I had to ready for the next day to go in court, and you never knew which one was going to go to trial when the judge said you’re on trial with that case.  My wife would be home with the two babies, and she wanted to tell me what happened that day, this kid did this and he ate this and he got sick with that, and this baby this.  I’d be trying to be the dutiful husband, looking at her, but my mind was clearly in court the next day, trying to figure out how to do whatever I had to do to win.  So I wasn’t in a comfort zone doing this.  I was doing fine, but wasn’t—I mean, the only thing I can say, it didn’t feel great to me.  It was okay, could have kept doing it.\n\nQ:  What was happening here?\n\nFederman:  What was happening here—the right question—is that by 1975 and leading up to that were two sets of Russes, Aunt Hattie and Uncle Murray, last name Gold, and my mother and father, the Federmans, and they did the business during the week, rotating on weekend shifts and whatever, and that’s for a long time.  Since the 1950s, that’s how the store ran, these two sets.  But by 1976, Uncle Murray and Aunt Hattie were retired.  They were older.  Can’t tell you how old now.  But they were retired.\nSo my mother and father were left here.  My father had an increasingly debilitating heart condition, so they began to talk about—or he did—selling Russ & Daughters.  He had tried to bring in various members of the family at various times, to no avail.  The ones that probably wanted to come in, he didn’t want.  But he never asked me to come in, never.  I was a lawyer and I was the guy he could brag about, “My son the lawyer,” right?  I was the only one of my generation of Russes who became a professional, so he liked to brag, “My son the lawyer.”  I assume he bragged when I was in the army, “My son the captain.”  Whether he bragged or not I was in Vietnam, I’m not sure how he felt about that.  I suppose he felt uncomfortable about it.\nAt any rate, so that’s what was happening.  It now became my mother and father.  He was increasingly ill.  The neighborhood had been into a downward spiral and it was just precipitous in the late seventies.  It was awful.  The late sixties, it sort of started.  Actually, after World War II, the guys came back, wanted out of the Lower East Side.  But it gathered more momentum, but by the late seventies, this neighborhood was awful.  I don’t know if you ever passed through here in the seventies or eighties.  This neighborhood was the pits.  \nOkay.  So business wasn’t doing well, he wasn’t doing well.  They were talking about selling it.  I suspect I wasn’t that happy doing what I was doing, so my bright idea, I came to him and said, “Look.  You want a partner?”  Not that he made me a partner.  [laughs]  “But I’ll work with you part-time and I’ll practice law part-time on my own.”  That was my plan.\n\nQ:  You didn’t dread being here?\n\nFederman:  No, I didn’t.  I’m surprised I didn’t, but I didn’t.  There was something always—as a kid coming in here, even though we came under protest, kicking and screaming, when the store was busy and all the stuff was happening, it was a show.  You see your mother and father and aunts and uncles dealing with these customers, and these customers, all this activity and vibrancy, and your parents and aunts and uncles are somebody special in there on their stage.  Then they would come over and I would say—my father’s Herbert—“Herbie, this your son?”  And they’d grab you by the cheeks.  “What a nice boychik.  Is he going to take over the business?’  And of course it’s the last thing that they wanted at that point.  But it was clear to me that my parents and aunts and uncles were somebody important in this store and were treated as such.\nOccasionally I’d get to ride with my father in the truck as a kid, like Take Your Kid to Work Day.  He would occasionally take me with him into work, but the first stop would be one or several smokehouses, to pick up the fish and pick out the fish, and you see what’s going on there, them yelling and cursing at each other, and the smells and whatever.  It was like show biz.  It’s frightening, it stinks, but it’s show business, something going on that’s out of the realm of normal life.  Then he’d stop at Ratner’s and take me.  You know Ratner’s, the dairy restaurant, right?  So Ratner’s.  He’d go in the back room and all his cronies were sitting there, who had businesses down here or whatever.  “Hi, Herbie.”\nOr even before that, coming over the bridge, there was a traffic cop at the end of the Williamsburg Bridge, so we’d come from Brooklyn smokehouses, from Far Rockaway, Queens, to the smokehouses in Brooklyn, over the bridge, and there’d be a traffic cop and they’d always wave to my father in the truck.  “Hey, Herbie!”  The cop is doing it.  In those days, cops were important.  So this was a cop paying homage to my father and saying hello, and if there was enough time to say, “Hey, you teachin’ your kid the business?”  \nAnd then to Ratner’s and the same group every day would be sitting there, ordering the same thing, and the same schlumpy waiter would come with the stuff and knew exactly what to give each guy.  I’d sit there, “Herbie, you brought your kid in.”  They’d all be doing what they did.  There was some drama about this that stuck.  The smells, the sights, the sounds, it stuck.\nSo I did what I was supposed to do, become a lawyer, the only one in my generation of Russes to do that, and then I decided—in the beginning I wasn’t giving it up.  My plan was to help them in the business, keep Russ & Daughters in the family—I think I recognized this place was something important—and practice law.  Well, the first day I came in here was the last day I practiced law, because it turns out—and I didn’t know this—this business is like overwhelming in details, and if you’re not paying attention to the details, you’re going to lose money.  If you’re not watching every piece of fish and every customer and how everything is handled, or watch the register, make sure the money goes in the register, I mean, there were no credit cards in those days, right?  It was all cash business.  So it’s like immediately overwhelming, and the idea of practicing law—so I tried to keep my hand in it by doing some kind of hearings as a hearing officer for this or that, but, you know, I got caught doing that in terms of I wasn’t in here at some point, and there was a New York Times reporter in here, didn’t like what she got, gave it a bad review, and I said, “Forget this law stuff,” you know.  So this became an obsession.  I became obsessive about this, maybe because I have an obsessive personality.\n\nQ:  What kind of obsession?\n\nFederman:  The obsession is to make sure everything is perfect at all times, beyond reasonable expectation, so that if the store looks beautiful but there’s a smudge on that—you see the showcase is glass in the front?  Okay, people have a habit of taking their hands, like they want to reach in, and they’re putting their fingerprints all over that showcase.  Everything in the store can be perfect, but if I’m seeing fingerprints on the showcase, it’s not.  And my fear is that somebody’s going to come in, the wrong person, and write up, “Russ & Daughters is dirty.  What happened with this generation?  They don’t have the ethic,” whatever.  So that haunted me.\nAnd whenever I thought about changing something, I was haunted by the notion, you know, what would my parents or grandparents or aunts and uncles think?  There was always a struggle.  So if I wanted to put coffee, sell coffee in the store, my mother would say, “We never sold coffee.  Who are you going to sell coffee to?”  Right?  “Why are you going to sell coffee?”  It was always a question.  “What do you want to do that for?”\n\tSo every step that I took was problematic for me, and the neighborhood continued to go down and I sweated out each customer one by one, made sure that I waited on most of them myself so I could give them my personal charm, whatever that was, but they knew the owner and they want the owner to wait on them, right?  And I knew that every piece of fish that went out went out with my name on it.  I’m a Russ and on the door it says Russ.  So I had that.\nThis is all a weight and an anchor, you know, in both senses of the word.  The anchor is, I’m anchored to a family history of doing something on the Lower East Side, and some people really appreciate that.  Because the old-timers go, they disappear for a year or so, they show up again, they want the same piece of fish in the same place.  If it’s not there, what have you done?  And I knew the store was physically getting tired itself.  The neighborhood continued to spiral down, I think, until the nineties.  It always had some interesting thing going on.  The people that moved out of the neighborhood, all the Jews had moved out, the ones who became affluent, they would buy a quarter pound of lox in their neighborhood, but when their families were coming over, their son the lawyer was showing up or was bringing the future machatunim over, or was celebrating a graduation, some special occasion, the family together, they’d want to come to Russ & Daughters when they knew they were going to get quality.  So they kept coming.\nOf course, you know, nobody lived around here, and the neighborhood had a bad reputation.  Your car’s going to be broken into, you’re going to get mugged.  Sometimes it was true.  Bad weather.  They weren’t coming here.  \nFor a while we still had the momentum of the Sunday Blue Laws, which in effect made the Lower East Side because the rest of the world had to shut down on Sundays, but there was some special dispensation where the retail shops could be open on the Lower East Side on Sundays, so that you would find big lines waiting to get into the brassiere store, the ladies’ schmatta thing, you know, the fancy clothes.  So there was still vibrancy until those laws were taken off and anybody could be open on a Sunday.  And then the malls came in, where people could drive from their suburban homes to their suburban malls and park their car and have all the shops there.\nSo that was all the death knell for the Lower East Side, and I just sort of—you know, people would say to me, “Mark, why don’t you move your store uptown where your customers are?”\nAnd I said—it was a flip response—“Sooner or later, uptown is going to move downtown,” I said.  I don’t know if I really meant it or why.  We owned the building.  I couldn’t see working to pay a landlord.  That’s sort of another thing you don’t do in this family.  So I didn’t move, and people would come and we would maintain their business.  Little by little, we increased it.  The old Jews that I inherited from my family as customers, suddenly they were leaving.  They weren’t eating it anymore or the salt they weren’t eating, they moved down to Florida, or they went further south and they were in the cemetery.  But then people more my age, you know, that I had more simpatico with, they were coming in, and some of them turned out to be important people in the world, who knew then, you’re waiting on them, you like them, you talk to them, you schmooze.  I like people, basically, and you’ve got to do that to be in this business.  We schmooze.  I knew fish, I learned fish, so I knew good fish and what people’s tastes were.  That was happening.\nSo it was a struggle.  It was a real struggle.  It’s not like a lot of money was being made.  In 1995, we renovated the store, not meaning the whole thing, just the candy side had gotten tired and the floors and the ceilings and the lighting, so we did that.  So I lined up a business consultant and an architect and an engineer and whatever, and I said, “Look, we need this renovated, but you cannot make this look like uptown.  We are downtown, so we’ve got to maintain our old look.  We’ve got to do it in two weeks,” because we only close for two weeks in the summer.  “We’ve got to have it done.”\nThey said, “Of course.”  Of course they’re going to do it, but they charge you five times more.  But we did it, and we did it, I think, the right way, so we maintained the tile concept, the ceiling concept, and we didn’t make it look trendy uptown chic.  It looks like what it’s supposed to look like, what my grandparents want it to look like and my aunts and uncles, clean and neat, and it’s food and it’s going to be clean and fresh and full and filled in all the time.  I think we maintain that.\nSo part of me wanted to do something with the business.  The other part of me had this sense of tradition.  Would they have done it?  I always have to ask myself the question, would my grandparents, my parents have done it this way?  I don’t know.  Things just sort of happen.  People’s tastes change.  They’re going to eat less salty food, so instead of so much belly lox, they’re going to eat Nova Scotia, and suddenly it’s not just Nova Scotia available, it’s salmons from around the world, Scotch salmon, Irish salmon.  So you start bringing those in.  And cream cheese is not just cream cheese anymore; they want tofu cream cheese.  So you do that and you hope that they’re not rolling over in their graves, the Russ family.  But turns out it’s not so bad.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we stop here and then pick it up again.\n\nFederman:  I think I ran out of steam.\n\nQ:  Well, one does.\n\nFederman:  That’s a little monologue I was just in.\n\nQ:  That’s good.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tFederman -  PAGE 46\n\n\n\nInterviewee:  Mark Federman\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #2\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t           New York City\n\nDate:  January 31, 2011\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is January 31, 2011, and I’m with Mark Federman upstairs and next door from Russ & Daughters.\n\tGood morning.\n\nFederman:  Good morning.\n\nQ:  We got as far as your leaving the law and coming to the store the first time we spoke.  We spoke a little bit about that.  What did you see when you got here?  When you walked into the store and thought about—well, you didn’t think about whether or not you were going to hang in there at first.  Tell me what you saw when you walked in.  I don’t mean visually.\n\nFederman:  Well, I’m not sure I can remember exactly what I saw, but I think an impression was, if not the first day, shortly after that, this wasn’t really what I had in mind.  I’m not sure what I had in mind.  It might have been a more romantic notion of just greeting the customers and being Mr. Russ in front of the store and having everybody happy.  I don’t know, while I lived with this all my life and watched my parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles do this on a daily basis, I don’t know if it ever struck me or I ever understood how difficult this was, and here I was doing it alone.  As soon as I came in, my father exited, for the most part, because he had a bad heart condition.  That was the purpose of this transfer.  My mother was not all that much help.  She was tending to my father.  I think they took off for Pritikin, where they were trying to, I don’t know, turn things around for him.  My aunt and uncle had retired and they had moved to Florida.\nSo I was pretty much alone, although I inherited a staff from them of employees who were not particularly enthusiastic about my arrival on the scene.  One fellow in particular, Sidney, who I describe as a farbisner. \nQ:  What a farbisner?\n\nFederman:  Somebody that’s just dried up and angry.  I suspect that it was his impression that he would take over the business.  He had been there since leaving the army right out of World War II.  He’d come and had been the store manager for some years and I think often he’d let the customers believe that he was a member of the Russ family.  But anyhow, when I showed up, it was probably a surprise to him.  He knew me almost since I’m born, I guess, and he watched as I was probably the most academically successful of the Russ grandchildren, and then I became a lawyer and I was in the army and I practiced law, I had a good position.  So it must have been a shock to him that I showed up and was introduced as the heir apparent to Russ & Daughters.  So he was not going to make my life easy.  It wasn’t his style to make it easy for anybody, not for the fellow employees who he would beat up on verbally.  There was always some issue to his integrity.  The old concept in retail, keep your eyes on the register, is not without justification.\n\nQ:  What does that mean?\n\nFederman:  Keep your eyes on the register?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFederman:  Well, you know, because your help is going to take money from the register.  It’s a cash business.  There were no credit cards in those days that were being used in normal transactions.  So it was a cash business and you had to watch.  Some line I heard from a woman whose father owned a bakery—the woman was eighty-seven; I spoke to her recently—her father owned a bakery two doors to the right, was that her father had a conversation with my grandfather, and she claims that my grandfather had two young guys working for him who had pegged pants.  I said, “What are pegged pants?”  Apparently they were fashionable in that day, 1920 whatever, right?  And her father said to my grandfather, “Russ—.”  They all pronounced Russ as “Roose.”  “Russ, you gotta get rid of those boys.  They’re not going to let you make a living.”  And she claims the story went on, so she obviously heard this from her father, that he also told my grandfather, “Why don’t you bring your daughters into the business,” and my grandfather said to him, “Never.”\nWell, I mentioned this story recently to my mother and my aunt, my aunt being ninety-eight years old, my mother being ninety, and they said that can’t have happened.  First of all, they didn’t know about the kids with the pegged pants, and number two is, it was clear to them that it was expected of them to come into the business from a very early age, so my aunt, the eldest aunt, came in when maybe she was eleven, and maybe her sister came in when she was twelve, started coming on weekends.  They had to go to school.  And my mother says, “And I was lucky, I didn’t have to come in and help out on the weekends till I was fourteen.”\nMy eldest aunt did not finish high school.  At age sixteen she quit, and it was 1929, so the market had crashed.  She went out and had some jobs, but ultimately came back to help her father, and all the daughters came in.\nI don’t know how I got to this point in this monologue.\n\nQ:  That’s okay.  You were talking about Sidney.\n\nFederman:  Me coming into the business.  So the primary characters were Sidney and Louie.  Louie was there to be Sidney’s whipping boy.  I think they hired Louie so that Sidney wouldn’t beat up too much on the customers.  He had a nasty—I mean, when you hear stories of nasty counter men and waiters and the Ratner’s thing, Sidney was like the paradigm for all of this.  He was just nasty.  So when I came in, this nastiness really had a focus.  He would stick a knife in your back, and I wasn’t sure I didn’t have to fear that literally.  There were knives, you know.\nSo Sidney made me miserable and would never really teach me the business, what was going on.  Sidney did everything fast, moves, whatever.  He had that issue.  Fortunately, he had that part of the Russ mantra where you keep everything clean, so there was always a rag and cleaning, whatever.  He made himself look busy and like he knew what he was doing, and wouldn’t share in the secrets like this salad, how was it made, or, you know, anything about the fish.  So I was left with this.\n\nQ:  Who was making the salads?\n\nFederman:  The kitchen crew in the back.  There weren’t that many fancy salads being made.  It was coleslaw, potato salad, chopping herring, whitefish salad.  There wasn’t a lot going on, but whatever it was, it was going to be a mystery that Sidney wasn’t going to let me know about so that, one, he kept his position as being indispensable, the manger of the store, and, two—\n\n[Begin File 2]\n\nFederman:  Where are we?  Are we going in the right direction?\n\nQ:  Yes.  What year was that when you put José and Herman on the—\n\nFederman:  I don’t remember.  It was, I don’t know, four or five years after I came here.  I don’t really remember when that happened, but I never looked back.  They’re fabulous.  They’re really fabulous.  I tell them, “You may have been born a Reyes [phonetic] and a Vargas [phonetic] and [unclear], but you’re Russes.”  Their passion, their ability to work hard, their dedication, their honesty, I’ve never seen anything like those two guys.\nHerman has got the personality, which is just so spectacular, and he also has the ability to double-talk, so that when a customer complains about something, who knows what, Herman is able to just turn that around into a pretzel and they don’t know what happened.  [laughter]  I see them, their eyes glazing over.  “What the hell was the response there?”  But it works, and they keep coming back.  His motivation, both of them, were to please customers, which is essential.  I don’t know if that was the feeling in the generations before, whether it was about pleasing customers.  Certainly you had to please the customer, but these guys would bend over backwards to do it.\n\nQ:  What about your father? \n\nFederman:  My father was like totally charming, totally charming to the customers.  It was a whole other can of worms at home.  And I resented that, because I would see him here, he would spend hours in his little office.  You still haven’t seen the size of that office back there.  He would spend hours there with some customer or other, BS’ing, or a supplier, talking, laughing, smoking cigars, joking around, and I was jealous of the attention, because by the time he got home, he didn’t even want to talk.  He wanted to sit in front of the television, have his dinner served.  He was spent.  So I resented it.\nWhen it came to the kids, he was very volatile.  This is like a shrink session here I’m having with you.  He was very volatile.  But I got this, relating it back to Russ & Daughters, I got this only after I worked here and I understood how you were “on” and had to be “on” here all the time for the suppliers, for the customers, for the staff, so that by the end of the day, you didn’t have anything more to give, so if you went home and your wife wanted to say—or my mother got it, you know.  But, you know, there was trouble with this, the pipe burst, the kids did this.  There was no patience for that.  He had no patience.  And I was constantly on guard in my own life, but when you get tired and stuff, sometimes you slip, but that was the thing that I found distressing.\nMy father was so charming.  Everybody loved my father, Herbie.  Then I got here and I found out its origin.  Well, I mean, there were other origins in his own family.\n\nQ:  What about the product?  Did you change it at all?  Did you keep it the same?\n\nFederman:  Me personally?\n\nQ:  Yes.  How extensive was the product when you came in?\n\nFederman:  There were fewer products, and as more products became available—\n\nQ:  Like what?\n\nFederman:  Okay.  Salmon, for instance.  Salmon was basically belly lox salt-cured salmon, not smoked, real old-fashioned stuff that I still adore at times.  And then the smoked salmon was, by and large, Nova Scotia from the Atlantic Ocean, and then Nova, to distinguish it from the Pacific Ocean, both smokes salmons, both mild cured smoked salmons.\n\nQ:  Which was Pacific?\n\nFederman:  Pacific was the Nova.  But, you know, every appetizing store had a way of calling whatever they had in it.  Some of them called lox anything.  Anything in the store would be called lox.\nInterestingly, it has nothing to do with you, but my daughter Niki had a surprise interview appearance on WNYC just a few days ago.  Do you know this?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nFederman:  Brian Lehrer Show.  You know?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFederman:  So he had as a guest a guy named Ben Zimmer, who took over for William Safire for the “On Language,” the wordsmith guy.  So the segment was about parsing the president’s State of the Union message, he said this and this meant that, blah, blah, blah.  And Brian Lehrer said, “Well, you know, if you ask people, one of the words that sticks in most people’s mind from the speech was ‘salmon.’”  I don’t know if you saw the president’s State of the Union.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFederman:  He attempted some joke about regulation.  We have regulation when salmon’s out at sea, we have other regulations when the salmon’s up the river, and imagine the regulations when the salmon gets smoked.\n\nQ:  A very Washington kind of joke, but go ahead.  [laughs]  A regulation joke.\n\nFederman:  So Brian Lehrer, taking off on that some days before this particular interview—we’re counting this—he said—and I had said on the air that this is a first, the first time that lox have made its way into the State of the Union message, and then he got a nasty email from one or more of his listeners, who said lox is not smoked salmon.  And he said, “My surprise today—.”  This just happened on Friday.  “I have a surprise.  We’re going to get this straightened out by an expert, Niki from Russ & Daughters in New York.”\nSo he gets Niki on the phone.  Niki apparently had a forty-five-minutes heads-up on this.  “Niki, this is Brian Lehrer.”\n“Hi, Brian.”  Well, anyhow, she was great and relaxed and whatever, and describing the difference between lox as pure salt-cured unsmoked salmon and smoked salmon. \n\nQ:  Let me ask you something.  At that point when you came, was any salmon farmed?\n\nFederman:  No, it wasn’t.  We weren’t selling farmed salmon in those days.  It was wild salmon.\n\nQ:  Certainly on the West Coast and on the East Coast.\n\nFederman:  From both oceans.  It was beginning to get depleted, but still enough of it.  Maybe it was $16 a pound, $4 a quarter, 3.99 a quarter.\n\nQ:  That’s very funny, because my memory from that moment, too, is $4 for a quarter of a pound.\n\nFederman:  Right.  Wild salmon, right?\n\nQ:  I didn’t know it was wild.\n\nFederman:  Farmed salmon really hadn’t entered, or at least we weren’t dealing with farmed salmon for as long as possible.  We didn’t deal with farmed caviar as long as possible, believing that we were the place that was supposed to sell wild fish and fish eggs.  So the salmons were free, basically, and then there was baked salmon also.  Baked salmon is a hot smoked salmon, different processes, too much to go into now.  But that was it.  I mean, the typical smoked fish.  So you had sturgeon, always, and whitefish and chubbs.  Chubbs are disappearing.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you, for the record, explain what chubbs are.\n\nFederman:  Chubbs look like small whitefish.  These are all lake fish, mostly Great Lake fish, and the whitefish roughly two to three pounds.  Sometimes they get up to nine or ten pounds, but basically that’s it.  You serve it at a party, take out the bone, you fillet it, and it’s a whitefish.  It’s a white-flesh meat and fat and rich and quite delicious.\n\tThe chubb is a sort of smaller version of it.  It’s a different species, but people think it’s a baby whitefish, and it’s not.  It’s its own species, but, again, it comes from the same waters, although chubbs, I believe, swim at a different depth than whitefish.  But half the world had, in the past, half the world will claim that chubbs are better to eat and half will claim that whitefish are better, for the same reasons, it’s fatter, sweeter, whatever.  Then the half who are eating whitefish claim it tastes better by the head, the other half by the tail, some by the middle.  You know, we’re Russ & Daughters.  We sell tail, head, chubbs, whitefish, you know.\nWe have a sign—you’ll see it—behind the counter.  It says De Gustibus Non Est Disputandam.  Somebody gave me that sign.  Latin, “Of Taste There is No Dispute.”  Basically, if you like it, it’s the best.  So there’s different tastes for everything.\nBut some of these fish disappeared.  Wild salmon, you know, wild Atlantic salmon has been fished out, and that’s a shame.  We sell Gaspe salmon now.  It’s basically the same Atlantic species with a big fat Nova Scotia, what was called Nova Scotia salmon, Atlantic salmon, came from Nova Scotia, and the best of it came from the Gaspe Peninsula, and that’s what we sold.  So now we have a farm version of the same thing, which tastes very much the same, the Gaspe salmon.\n\nQ:  Then you would have gotten it from somebody who supplied Gaspe salmon, when you came?\n\nFederman:  When I came, the wild fish were bought by the smokers.  Huge amounts was bought by the smokers, and we bought it from the various smokers that we were dealing with.  \nDealing with the smokers is a huge other education I got, was not prepared for when I came in.  I don’t know what I thought when I came in.  I thought it was all going to be easy and romantic and I would be the king of the walk, and I would be doing something meaningful.  \nSo the question is, why did I give up law and come in here?  And I’ve never satisfactorily answered that myself, but I suppose--because I was thinking about this this morning--I suppose I wasn’t that happy practicing law.  I suppose that it wasn’t meaningful for me.  I didn’t find any meaning, although I had various jobs practicing law.  I was in the army doing JAG work, then I was doing that also in Vietnam and stateside.  Then I came back and I worked for Legal Aid Family Court for a period of time, and the concept there was to give kids a fair shake and see if you could help them before they go through the criminal justice system.  It was something fairly new, Juvenile Rights Division.  That turned out to be a disaster, as far as I could tell.  We weren’t really practicing law and weren’t helping any of these kids.  It was an animal show.\nThen they formed something just about that time called the Office of the Special Prosecutor.  I probably told you this.  That was about anti-corruption work that came out of Serpico and the Knapp Commission, and that sounded romantic.  I did that for about five years, and that sort of seemed, after a while, to be fruitless and the romance wore off.\nThen I went to a private firm because now I had a kid and I needed to make some money, so I went to a firm and I wanted to be a litigator and try cases.  But working for a law firm and being on trial all the time wears thin, so when you come home, your head is not really at home.  So anyhow, there may be meaning in law, and I’m sure some lawyers find meaning there, but it didn’t attach itself to me.\nThen I wanted to have an exposure to the world, and it seemed to me law wasn’t doing that.  It really is insular, a lot like medicine.  You’re not really engaged with that much of the world.  In a place like Russ & Daughters, it turns out, more and more so as time goes on, the world comes to you, all of the world, all these different people from all over the world come in and are happy to talk to you and share their stories and find out—you know?\nSo I had those notions in mind that I would fall into this, walk around, strut around the store, be Mr. Russ, and then I realized, you know, you got to get the fish in the store, taken care of, handled, please the customers, keep the help in line, doing the right thing and motivated.  Every moment you had to match up a piece of fish and a counter man and a customer, and you had to get it right because your name, Russ, was on the door.  And then you didn’t have a lot of—at least this is what I felt—didn’t have a lot of room to experiment, because I was dealing with a business that had been here already in ’78, the business, put aside the pushcart phase of this business, officially established in 1914, so this is sixty-four years later.  Is that right?  Yes, we’re moving towards a hundred years.\nSo this is sixty-four years later, history of the way it ran, and then I inherited a staff who knew how it had run and were not interested in changing anything, and a customer base who had largely moved out of the neighborhood, but when they came back, they wanted to make sure that everything was the same as the last time they came, whether it was six days ago or six months ago, whatever.  If you moved the chopped herring from this side of the showcase, they’re like, “What’d you do here?  What’s this kid doing to this store?”  So I inherited that.\nSo what was my view?  I think my view was rather from the beginning.  Okay, then this is placed inside a neighborhood which is in total free-fall.  The Lower East Side was the pits.  The street life was inhabited by pimps and prostitutes and junkies and criminals.  It was like, yeah, it was terrible.  The city had given up services.  It was awful down here.  So whatever romantic notion I had or notions I had were sort of dispelled quickly.\nI wanted to pick up a thread.\n\nQ:  Did you think of moving away from the Lower East Side?\n\nFederman:  Sure.  That was a constant.  My thoughts were existential.  Are we going to continue to exist?  Occasionally I find pieces of paper I put in various places in my house.  I’m big on scribbling things down.  Now with a computer I don’t have paper, but occasionally the computer breaks down and I lose my—so at least with a scratch piece of paper, you know it may be someplace.  You may not uncover it for twenty years.  But I found some scratchy notes, with me.  Question: how long can I keep this going?  Am I the generation that will preside over the failure of Russ & Daughters?  And that was a horrible thought.  So I just was trying not to take over the world with this, but trying to sort of negotiate the icebergs, the shoals and all the stuff I was dealing with.\nSo moving uptown, in fact, customers would come in often and say, “Hey, Mark, why don’t you move your business uptown where your customers are?”  Which made sense.  But the concept, because we owned the business and, in effect, I was paying myself rent, of moving and paying a landlord rent was not one that the Russ family, we weren’t big on that.  And, two, I always had the sense that we were in our historically correct location.  Even if the world changed around us, this is where people know us.  So if they were a Jew from Argentina or France or whatever, any place in the world, California, Chicago, and they wanted to come back to the Lower East Side, they wanted to make sure Russ & Daughters was still here, whether they heard about it or they shopped here once or their parents or grandparents shopped here.  So this was a location for us, and I didn’t know if it would work outside of our current location.\n\nQ:  Who did you see as your competition, if anybody?  What state was Zabar’s in at that point?\n\nFederman:  Zabar’s is great.  Zabar’s is the only one I paid attention to, because Zabar’s represented what had become a huge business, big family, huge business, and I don’t do envy very often, but Zabar’s I was envious of, past tense.  I was envious of.  The reason it’s past tense—oh, and part of what I was doing also is trying to negotiate and exist, I felt very strongly that I spend time with my family.  By now I had two young kids, and I didn’t have enough of my parents’ attention.  My mother worked on weekends, left us with a terrible grandmother, my father’s mother.  So, you know, we all try to learn from the mistakes we think our parents made.  Then we make our own new mistakes.  Some of theirs and our own, we create our own.\nSo where was I now?\n\nQ:  Zabar’s.\n\nFederman:  Oh, yes, Zabar’s.  Okay.  That was the one thing I was envious of because I would hear about Zabar’s buying this much fish, was taking this much money, and I always figure I’m as smart as anybody else, not necessarily smarter, but as smart, so I felt somewhat envious of that.  From time to time I would run into one of the Zabars in the smokehouses.  I would be picking out fish.  Then I was running into, more often than the others, David Zabar, who’s the son of one of the brothers, Stanley or Saul. David was new in the business, was somewhat younger than I, and we would talk.  I would tell him whatever we would talk about, I was going here with my family, going on a ski trip, whatever, blah, blah, blah.\n\tSo, some years later there was an article in maybe the New York Magazine about Zabar’s and how it was explosive and the family was fighting, and David would say, while they were interviewing him, and he was pissed off that his family wanted him to work a hundred hours a week and he wasn’t going to take it, blah, blah, blah, typical next-generation, “Why I have to work this hard?”  And he said, “And I have this friend and we meet each other in the smokehouses, and he runs this kind of business and he’s with his family and he’s not working a hundred hours.”  [laughs]  So the irony is that here’s this guy who I envied with the volume of his business, and it turns out he’s envying me for my lifestyle.  So that was the last time I think I envied anybody for anything.  You know, it took me a while to realize we run very different kinds of businesses.\nWhen I came in, also the food world was changing.  The concept of the little Mom and Pop, Edsel, Pedsel and Company business, foods, specialty foods business, was going by the boards.  I mean, in every community you’d see it.  First of all, the communities were changing.  The Italian community little or no longer existed.  So the little bakeries and little [unclear] and whatever, and the Jewish neighborhood of the Lower East Side, you know, that had disappeared, so the delis were going.  The appetizing stores, I think there was maybe two or three or four left here when I first got here, or five, when I first got here, when there were twenty or thirty of them, you know, in its heyday here.  Now we’re the only one that exists here, and maybe one of the few—you can count them on one hand—that exist in the city at all.\nSo the concept of this specialty food business, Mom and Pop family thing was disappearing, and food was going to one-stop shopping and it was getting fancy, so you had not only Zabar’s, you had Balducci’s.  Even the supermarket world was trying to get fancy, with the Food Emporiums.  Then sometimes they got places that got too fancy.  Dino De Laurentiis—I forget which year that was—decided to make some extravaganza on the Upper West Side with whatever he called it, Food Halls.  I forget what he called it.  Food Works, something.  And that didn’t last.  But nonetheless, it was about big one-stop shopping.  That was going on.  There was no economy of scale in doing what we did.  It didn’t make sense as a business model anymore.  The neighborhood was changing.\n\nQ:  Did you deliver?\n\nFederman:  No, we didn’t.  I tried delivering for a while.  It turned out to be a disaster, because you had to send two people to get around the city.  You sent one, you got a ticket.  Then you lost them for hours.  You didn’t know if they truly got stuck in traffic.  There were no cell phones in those days where you could check on a guy.  And it just didn’t really make any sense.\nOf course, if it was a big order, we’d wind up delivering it ourselves.  I remember some guy showed up, one of the first Christmases.  It was some kind of actor, some kind of famous actor.  I don’t remember his name, or semi famous.  He wanted to give little one-pound boxes of chocolate candies to I don’t know how many people, fifty, a hundred, whatever, and he wanted them delivered during Christmas.  So my wife took one of the guys from the kitchen, and we packed them in little stupid white boxes, tried to wrap them.  I mean, we learned, by doing it ourselves, so many things.  We learned the hard way.  Mostly my parents, we inherited what they did, so I suppose here and there they made things a little better, and I think here and there we made some things better and easier.\n\nQ:  So if you didn’t deliver, that means people had to come here.\n\nFederman:  People had to come here.  That’s right.  Shipping is another issue.  Shipping is a big part of our business.  Didn’t exist then.  Here’s what I inherited.  My father and uncle, particularly my uncle was very conservative about this, my father was more trusting and wanted to build up the business, my uncle was very conservative, so if somebody, for instance, an important person from Hollywood wanted five pounds of sturgeon for a party, here’s how it went.  He would say, “Send me a check.  Here’s how much it’ll cost you.  Send me a check.  When it clears, I’ll send you the merchandise.”  [laughter]  \nThere were no credit cards in those days, and there wasn’t really overnight shipping, so they’d have to pack it in dry ice.  To pack something in dry ice, you had to get a delivery of a big thing.  We didn’t use dry ice particularly.  So you’d get this big thing of ice, you’d chip it away, you’d put it in there with the smoke going over, and then you had to make out paperwork for the airlines.  They weren’t happy to have this thing change the cabin pressure and stuff.  It was a nightmare, so we really didn’t do it.  We discouraged it from happening.  That was shipping.\n\tThen credit cards came in, so I beefed up the shipping business, because now you had a credit card.  Then you had overnight shipping, FedEx.  So it’s not like I was brilliant.  I mean, things changed in the world.  The food world changed, the shipping portion of it changed, the way business is done has changed.\nSo in 2000, my daughter Niki, who you know, 2000, 2001, she graduated college in ’99.  I forget when.  She graduated Amherst College, hot shot, very smart, lovely girl, and decided she was going to go West to San Francisco.  That seemed to be the pattern of the kids that graduated college.  If you graduated on the East Coast, you go and get a job on the West Coast, vice versa.  So Niki decided she was going to go West, and so, you know, the Jewish father, “What are you going there for?  Where are you going to stay?”  Whatever. \nAs it turns out, I met a customer in the store, a friend of Calvin Trillin’s.  He brought her in once and then she came in herself, and it turns out she’s from San Francisco, she heard Niki was going out there.  She offered her house to Niki so Niki could stay and get situated.  That’s what happens in Russ & Daughters, you know.\nNiki went there and became an assistant to the director or the assistant to the director of the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco, David somebody, whose name I don’t remember.  I think it took her about a year and a half to figure out that she wasn’t going to be the director, you know.  She was just an assistant.  But Niki’s an ambitious kid from New York.\nSo anyhow, she decided she was going to come back East, much to my delight, but she was going to come back East to work for a not-for-profit.  You notice the way I said that.  Not for profit.  I said, “Niki, we’re the Russ family.  We do for-profit only.”  Of course, my saying that was like the kiss of death on my own fantasy.  So Niki heard that from me, she was going to do this job for sure.  It was some, at that point, some creation, combination of the U.N. and Cisco Systems, the big computer—and they were going to solve all of the world’s problems on the computer.  They were going to get donations [unclear].  Niki was all fired up about this.  It lasted for her about five months.  She realized she was sitting in front of a computer screen, and that wasn’t very intriguing to her, and maybe for the same reasons that being a lawyer wasn’t all that intriguing to me.  Somehow it didn’t work.\nSo she left there, and we had given her an apartment here in the building.  It wasn’t this size; it was a studio.  So she was trying to figure out her next move, when 9/11 happened.  Actually, on 9/11, if you walk to the top of this building, we had then a spectacular view of the back of the building this way, on the top, of the World Trade Center towers.  It was like right in your face.  So when we understood what was going on, Niki and I went up to the top and watched the towers burn and smoke and fall down.  At some point, Niki said to me, “Dad, I think people are jumping out of the windows.” \nAnd I said, “No, Niki, it must be debris.”  But it turns out people were jumping out of the windows.\n\nQ:  Because it was early in the morning, so she still would have been here.  She probably wouldn’t have gone to work yet.\n\nFederman:  She was here living in the building, right.  But I guess the point I wanted to make was not that, but 9/11 changed the dynamic.  Certainly in a moment’s notice there were no jobs available, and she hadn’t figured out her next move.  I thought 9/11, for all its horrors, in a sense worked for me because now Niki would be here, realize that she was the heir apparent of Russ & Daughters.  My son always wanted to be a doctor and became a doctor, you know, and is happy being a doctor and is good at it and is doing good work.\n\nQ:  Where is he?\n\nFederman:  He’s at UCLA and he does pediatric oncology, so he’s not in it for the money, but he’s got a reputation for being a good doctor, which is terrific.  I often say I’m the only Jewish father who didn’t want a son to be a doctor.  I wanted him to be here.  Part of the irony we can get back to is now that I’m here, I want my kids to do this because I think this is good work.\n\tAt any rate, so Niki and her mother decided that Niki would be here till she figured it out, doing special projects.  I maybe mentioned this to you?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nFederman:  Here’s where we’re not on the same page.  I’m seeing Niki as the heir apparent, so I’m going to teach her the way the Russes learned to run this business.  You stand on the counter six days a week, ten hours a day.  That’s just on the counter.  You go home, you do the books, whatever, and you go to the smokehouse several times a week and you buy the fish, then you slice fish, you handle the fish, you tell people what to do.  First you learn how to do it right, blah, blah, blah.  So that’s my vision of this thing.\n\tNiki’s vision and her mother’s vision, my wife, is that Niki will be doing special projects.  I’m saying, “What’s a special project?  This is Russ & Daughters.  What could a special project do?”  A special project, to me, is somebody calls up a restaurant, says, “I need a hundred schmaltz herrings filleted in an hour.”  That’s a special project.  But they’re talking about the Internet, and I don’t know from this stuff.  I do have a computer in the store at this point.\n\nQ:  This point being about when?\n\nFederman:  2001.  Actually, I think I also have closed-circuit TV so I could see from the office to the front, what’s happening.  I have it focused on the register and on the customer thing.  So that’s how I got high tech.  That was about it.  But this Internet business, I’m clear it’s a business, but I don’t know about it.  You want to place an order, you’re in the store or you’re calling me and I know your voice.  Then I let you place an order.\nBut they’re determined, special projects, and my wife comes from a different culture.  She’s from South America society there, and shopkeepers are not held in high repute.  So she doesn’t want this for her daughter.  Plus she knows—now, my wife has been doing—when the kids were old enough and went to school and she had some free time, I started sort of getting my wife involved here, so she would do the books, she would do some of the candy buying, she would run around, do the yeoman’s work.  She tried to stay off the counter, where she never felt comfortable dealing with the public.  But, you know, there was always that sense that this place didn’t comport with her background, that she didn’t see her daughter, who is lovely, delightful, smart, doing this.  Our daughter should be president of the world, not running a little smoked fish outfit.\n\nQ:  Did she have issues with your coming back here, Maria?\n\nFederman:  No, she didn’t, or if she did, she didn’t say so.  I don’t know how much thought we gave to it.  We may have talked about it.  I suspect we did.  We may have had the same romantic notion that it’ll be easier than what I was doing, because I was on trial a lot of the time, and that means constantly your head is someplace else.  It’s an adversarial system in law, and your job is to basically beat the guy in court the next day.\nSo that wasn’t making me happy and I wasn’t able to pay attention to her.  Little did I know that I would come home thinking about whether whitefish are going to be available for Mrs. Goldberg and if it would be filleted right by José the next day.  But, you know, if you’re a worrier, you’re going to worry.  But I think what we both sort of felt was that what I was doing was not making me happy, therefore it wasn’t going to make her happy, and maybe I would have more time to play with the family and be home, whatever notions we had that turned out not to be true.\nSo at any rate, she was going to save her daughter from this, so now my wife is here and she sees how hard this is.  There are no storekeepers in her background.  There are judges and lawyers and senators and governors, right?  This is not like fish salesmen.  So God forbid her daughter does it.  So she’s going to protect her daughter.\nAnd I’m busy downstairs, happy, “Hey, everybody, meet my daughter Niki.  See how pretty she is, how smart she is?  She’s going to take over.”  Niki didn’t want to be my daughter.  She didn’t want to be anybody’s daughter.  She wanted to be her own person.  So I think I mentioned that she exited here after a few years, and my nephew came in.\nGetting back now, jumping around, getting back, you know, the neighborhood spiraled down and the issue was moving uptown, where the customers were, because, you know, they didn’t really want to come down here.  At some point a few years after I got here, really the stores that were draws down here stopped being draws because the malls were developed in the suburbs.\n\nQ:  You mean the Lower East Side stores, clothing stores, that kind of thing?\n\nFederman:  Yes.  I remember in the sixties and into the seventies, you walked down Orchard Street and there were some stores that always had lines.  I saw people waiting to get in to buy the schmattas that were designer or whatever they were.  They weren’t even dressing rooms.  Women were dropping their clothes and trying on these things.  Friedlich’s was one. I forget.\n\nQ:  You know what I used to do occasionally?  I would come down to the fancy fabric stores.  There were places that sold Italian fabric or something, so if you wanted a yard to make a miniskirt, you could do that.  [laughter]\n\nFederman:  That’s right.  Lots of fabric stores and things, woolens and stuff.  Then there were leathergoods stores and there were fur places, schmatta places and whatever.  But that started to disappear quickly also as the malls developed, as the department stores started to offer sales and they could compete with the Lower East Side, as it became more of a hassle to come down here, no place to park, it’s dirty, they’re going to break into your car.  The Sunday Blue Laws were a big part of keeping the economy going down here, because you couldn’t shop anyplace on a Sunday other than Lower East Side.  So people came in.  While they were doing here buying a schmatta or whatever, they’d come to Russ & Daughters while having their pillow stuffed.\n\nQ:  You never worried about having enough people coming here?\n\nFederman:  Always.  To this day.  Not really to this day, because the neighborhood has changed.  Yes, that was the existential worry.  Are there going to be people?  What happens on those days when I have more help than I do customers?  And some of the customers come in and they want an eighth of a pound and a long conversation with the owner.  That’s me.  I mean, it was dreadful.  And others came in and they were doing you a favor.  They came from uptown.  They’re used to having your mother or father or aunt and uncle wait on you, and here you were.  If they were older, they saw me as a kid.  They’re like one step out of the Lower East Side, but all of a sudden, you know, their noses were in the air.  Their husbands had made it in the schmatta business or something.  Then they come back, so they’re doing you a favor and they’d let you know that.  It was awful.\nWhy did I keep doing it?  Because I didn’t want to be the Russ to take it down the drain.  When people knew Russ & Daughters, they knew it and they smiled.  “Oh, yeah, Russ & Daughters ,” blah, blah, blah.  I just didn’t want to preside over the death of Russ & Daughters.\n\nQ:  Did you ever think of enlarging the product line?\n\nFederman:  And I did.\n\nQ:  How did you do that?\n\nFederman:  With a great deal of slowness and trepidation.  There was still my mother in the background.  My father had died two years after I came in.  They’d been in the background.  So we decided, so what do you do when you’re worried about you don’t have enough customers, and is anybody really interested in your product anymore, because your natural customer base is an older affluent Jew, because stuff is starting to get more expensive, older affluent Jewish person who was going to serve it—it’s not a daily thing you’re going to eat.  Maybe you’ll have a bagel and lox or when the family comes home and the son, who’s the doctor, is going to come back with the machatunim to show, you want to have it, but otherwise, they weren’t eating it regularly.  They were going low on salt or they moved to Florida or they were dead or whatever.  So who’s interested?  Was I selling the right things?  What do you do here?\n\nQ:  So what did you do?\n\nFederman:  Well, you know, you start changing some things.  You listen to the customers and what is it that they want.  What is it that they don’t want?  What is a natural thing to do?  One of the big things was for me to grow the caviar business, because it was a natural.  We had the connections for it.  We always sold some caviar, only not a large amount.  And so for some reason, perhaps ego, and I’m looking around seeing the other people selling caviar in this town, I figure—you know.  It took years because you have to develop a palette and be in a position to buy it, and who to buy what from, because in those days, it was like the Wild West in caviar.  Especially after the Soviet Union fell, everything went crazy.\n\nQ:  What about the olive oils and jams and things like that?\n\nFederman:  We always had that stuff, and we still have it.\n\nQ:  Some of it or a little?\n\nFederman:  We always had some.  My grandfather had the store and then his daughters, in the beginning.  There’s a picture there.  The ceilings were higher.  Ultimately the ceilings were dropped.  They were higher and they were floor-to-ceiling shelving with canned goods, sardines, salmon, tuna, sprats, that kind of stuff, and there was a market for it, particularly during World War II when the stuff was rationed.  Then Russ & Daughters seemed to be doing well because they figured out how to get a supply of this stuff, and they had a little warehouse on Ludlow Street, so during the war, people would come and they would be directed, hush-hush, in their cars over to Ludlow Street, and the trunks would be open and the cases would be put in the trunk.\nSo I think that’s when Russ & Daughters finally got to do some business and do better.  But it was canned goods, and people ate canned goods in those days.  Who eats canned goods anymore?  A can of salmon.  Nobody eats a can of salmon.  Now I have special salmon, you buy a little can of salmon, it’s like ten dollars.  It’s delicious, but it’s ten dollars.  And I don’t know if you remember the oval cans of salmon, oval shape.  You’re too young.  Oval-shaped salmon.  It was called a steak salmon.  The spring catch was considered better, and various producers.  Quite delicious.  I was able to get that myself, the last of it, from a producer in Oregon, and I sort of controlled the East Coast market.  It was expensive.\nI’m just remembering an anecdote.  A few days after 9/11, I got a call from one of our customers, Sam LeFrak.  He had built Battery Park City and a lot of other things.  Sam was an old customer at this point, in his eighties.  So he called.  Maybe this is not even a week after 9/11.  “Mark, I need my salmon.”  He was buying these by the case.  It was only the old Jews who were buying this stuff.  “I need my salmon.”\n“I don’t have it, Sam.”\n“What do you mean, you don’t have it?”  He started to yell at me, screaming.\nI said, “What are you yelling at me for?  Do you know what just happened?”\nHe said, “Do I know what happened.  You know, I just lost everything I have in Battery Park City.  Who else can I yell at?”  He felt comfortable yelling at me because I couldn’t get his salmon.\nBut the old Jews would eat canned goods.  The old Jews would suck on hard candies.  I mean, who does that stuff anymore?  We were selling canned goods and hard candies.  So that had to change, but there was a reluctance on my part, fearing that if I changed something, like move the chopped herring from one side of the showcase to the other, the customers would abandon me.  They would say, “What is this upstart doing here?”  You know?  The business ran for so many years, you know.  “What’s he changing what his parents and aunts and uncles and grandparents did?”  So that was that fear that I always carried around about change.\nSo one of the things we did was bring in coffee.  See, my wife was a bit motivating in this, because she didn’t have—\n\n[Begin File 3]\n\nFederman:  Where was I?\n\nQ:  Coffee.\n\nFederman:  Coffee.  My wife.  I’m blessed that my wife, for whatever she thought about this place, she did the work.  She absolutely did the yeoman’s work, never wanted any part of the spotlight of this thing because she’s not really a people person, but also she wasn’t emotionally attached to it like I was.  She didn’t have these ancestors calling out from the grave, “Don’t touch that.  Don’t move that,” whatever.  “What are you doing?”  Right?  So she was always, “We have to renovate.  We have to do something.”\n\tSo for some reason we decided to bring in coffee barrels.  We put in the coffee and we grind coffee.  We never sold coffee in this store.  We made coffee for the help to drink and the Russ family drank coffee.  So we brought in a line of coffee and it was fine.  People bought it.  It didn’t take over the world, but I think the most important thing about bringing coffee was that we had a sense that, okay, maybe lightning wouldn’t strike us.\nSo then little by little, there were things that had to be changed.  Enough people started to ask for the cream cheese substitute.  “Why don’t you bring in this tofu cream cheese they have?”  And I’m thinking my grandfather—there’s a big portrait of my grandfather handing over the candies.  I said, “That’s going to fall down if I do it.”  But, you know, enough people ask and you bring it in, and then more and more people are buying it.\n\nQ:  What does it taste like?\n\nFederman:  It’s not bad, actually.  It’s not bad at all.  If you’re lactose-intolerant or you don’t want to eat real cream cheese, sometimes I do, you know?  Especially if you mix it with vegetables or scallion or something.\nSo from that, you start changing a little bit here, a little bit there.  At some point, in 1995, at my wife’s prodding, we renovated at least the candy side of the store, the candy side and the floors and the ceiling, whatever.  By this point I had put in a new showcase because the old one had died.\n\nQ:  Was old, yes.  [laughs]\n\nFederman:  Really old and had died.  I was worried about when I ripped that out, what I was going to find underneath, whether I’d have to put in a new sub-floor and floor, whatever, but it turns out my grandfather’s concept was, you do it once, you do it right.  So there’s like four inches of concrete under there.  So we put in a showcase.  That was early on.\n\nQ:  It is a lot more candy than it used to be?\n\nFederman:  We had the window, and the window is still pretty much the way it was, where we had dried fruits.  Dried fruits, I don’t know where this came from, but dried fruits is a favorite for Jews, if nothing else, it keep them regular with the prunes, whatever.\n\nQ:  It’s delicious.\n\nFederman:  Also a favorite dessert is fruit compote.  They stew it up and they have dessert, and everybody likes that.  So the store had this nice display of maybe five different dried fruits, prunes, two different kinds, big prunes, too, the sweet big California prune.  My finger’s like three inches, right?  And then there was a big fat sour prune from Oregon.  Some people preferred the sour—I did—that tart taste.\nThen there were apricots.  In those days, the apricots were this Turkish apricot, that was this California Blenheim, also big and tart and soft and fabulous, and pears and peaches and apples.  That was pretty much it, five or six different items in long trays in the window, and people would walk by and look in, say, “Oh, yeah, I need some dried fruit.”  It would be a draw.\nOver the dried fruit we had hanging down strings of Polish mushroom.  It seems rather arcane, but in the turn of the last century and going forward, it was very much a staple for Eastern Europeans to have dried mushrooms.  As I understand it, the reason was ,you couldn’t afford to buy meat.  This is such an earthy, deep rich taste, that it substituted for meat in soups or in sauce or whatever.  So my grandfather, rather early on, billed himself as an importer of these dried Polish mushrooms.  I don’t think he imported them himself, but he bought them from another importer here.  But I saw a reverse directory in 1929, so it was on the t0p billing, two different listings.  The top billing was J. Russ Imported Mushrooms and the next one was J. Russ Appetizers.  So he fancied himself a mushroom guy, and a mushroom was a staple.  Now a pound of mushrooms is someplace between $150 and $175 a pound.  They’re hard to get and not that many people eat them or know what to do with them, but they’re fabulous, sort of that rich deep mother-earth truffle-y thing going on.\nSo the candy side had that and it had these mushroom things hanging down, and then against the back wall it had these candy bins.  Maybe there were twenty of them.  Each one had individual wrapped hard candy, which was common, but less and less were people buying hard candies.  You know anybody who has hard candies in their pocket anymore?  No, but every first-generation Jew always had a hard candy or several hard candies in their pockets.  They would eat it themselves or they would give it out as gifts, hand out hard candies to their grandchildren, nieces, whatever.  It’s a treat.  But that stopped happening, so that had to go.\nIn the front of the counter, I’m picturing this again.  Off to the side we had these glace fruits, really sticky.  I’m not quite sure why people bought them.  They were pretty to put out, serve, but it was sticky.  Then we had other things that we don’t have anymore, like candied kumquats, also sticky, and ginger.\nThen we had two showcases in the front, candy showcases.  One had a lot of nuts, individual nut things, but they were wood and they were open, and that meant in the summertime you’d get these bug-y things going on.\n\nQ:  There’s a lot of chocolate now.\n\nFederman:  Well, we had chocolate then, not when I was a kid.  When I was a kid working in the store, from age thirteen you had to come in on the weekend on a rotating basis.  That was part of the deal of being a Russ.  You didn’t want to, but they needed help.  It was only the candy side, and they paid you very well.  It was like a dollar an hour or 1.10 an hour.  So a ten-hour day, you made like eleven dollars.  You were rich.  That’s a lot of baseball cards, whatever you’re going to buy, right?  In those days, a movie was 25 cents, a slice of pizza was 10, 25 cents.  I forget what it was, or a hot dog.\n\tSo they had chocolates.  When I was a kid working there, the chocolates were basically twists, the chocolate-covered marshmallow twists, but the twists were different in those days because they would freeze.  So you’d put them in the freezer and then you’d have this frozen chocolate-covered marshmallow thing which they thought was a treat.\n\nQ:  It sounds fabulous.\n\nFederman:  It was okay.  Then they had little squares of chocolate-covered halvah. They’re not made anymore. Now they’re wrapped.  Those were little, better.  Then there were these marmalade bars that were two colors.  They were like red and orange and either had sugar and then like a white layer in between, and had either crystallized sugar on the outside or sprinkles, chocolate sprinkles.  I mean, to this day people show up every six months and will say, “Where’s the marmalade bar?”  Or they’re on a mission for themselves or for some aged parent or grandparent, you know.  You want to be remembered in the will, find me this thing I used to get at Russ & Daughters.  And they’d show up and ask for it.  So that’s when I was a kid.\n\tThen also I remember big barrels.  One was of peanuts in a big stainless-steel barrel, and they had these peanuts there, fresh roasted peanuts.  The problem is, the customers would just take them while they were waiting, and it’d be all over the floor.  The other one was a big barrel full of buxa.  You know what buxa is?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nFederman:  Buxa is dried carob, and I don’t know how the Jews got into buxa.  They love buxa.  Also buxa turns out to be one of nature’s great natural laxatives.  But you bite this thing, it was really hard, and you’d make sure not to eat the little seedy thing in there, and it had that carob-y taste, which became something of a chocolate substitute when you sweetened it.  But it had a very weird sort of funky taste to it, but then there were the classic customers who just had to have it.  So that’s what I’m remembering.\n\tIn chocolates, maybe we had also rum cordials, coffee beans.  I think that was pretty much it.  Someplace along the line, they found a line of hand-dipped chocolates, which were truly hand-dipped from a little lady [Sheila Kaye] in Brooklyn who was doing it, and she was making wonderful hand-dipped chocolates.  So then they had a display of chocolate-covered pineapple cores and prune and apricot and orange peel and chocolate-covered ginger, and then marshmallows of different kind.  The best was like a maple marshmallow chocolate-covered hand-dipped with a line of caramel.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nFederman:  Right.  Exactly.  So there was this whole line, and then there was this one I didn’t like but a lot of people did, honeycomb.  What is that stuff?  Honeycomb, chocolate covered.  It was awful, but people liked it.  So they had this line of hand-dipped chocolates.  So we got in the chocolate business.\n\tWell, someplace along the line, Nassau Candy took over the business, the lady sold out, she got older, sold out to some big candy company, who then commercialized it, and that wasn’t so good anymore.  But now my daughter and nephew have discovered some small companies making sort of artisanal little chocolates that are quite wonderful, much more expensive, but quite wonderful.  So they like to buy things that are small family-company artisanal stuff and try to sell that.\n\nQ:  All of this is way fattening.  That hasn’t affected the people who want to buy it?\n\nFederman:  When you’re in this store, you’re not going to be wanting to think about fattening or salt.  There’s no reason to be in the store, Russ & Daughters, if that’s what your thinking is.  It’s just the way it is.  I tried at one point, when I realized that, to dabble in different products, so every year we’d go to Fancy Foods Show.  You’ve been in the Fancy Food Center, right?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFederman:  You know what that’s—\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFederman:  As a kid, I would occasionally get taken by my father to the Fancy Foods Show, which was then the Candy and Confection Show in the Columbus Circle, whatever was there at the time.  I’m talking about a long time ago.  That was very exciting for a kid, and then you could have samples of stuff, and the suppliers would recognize my father as Russ & Daughters, and they would schmooze him up and give me candies and pencils with the name on it.  So it’s part of the romantic notion I carried forward.\n\tNow we go to the Fancy Foods Show, International Fancy Foods Show in the Javits Center, it’s like that on steroids.  It’s extraordinary.  But it’s always with an eye towards finding new products.  Most often, you know, it’s finding the same products repackaged, so it gets a little old, but still I walk around and say hello to the vendors, and people, “Oh, Russ & Daughters,” blah, blah, blah, you know.\n\tI remember once finding a sugar-free halvah, and I decided that this may be an oxymoron, but I had to try it.  The Jews were then realizing they were all diabetic.  Remind me, the story about my recollection about James Beard.  At any rate, so I tried to bring this stuff in, and no Jew was going to buy that.  It was awful, dry, straw-y tasting, like whatever.\nThe James Beard this is, I didn’t know James Beard.  I think my parents had dealt with him several times in the store, or often, but by the time I came in here, I was dealing with Clay, who was his houseman, assistant, whatever, sort of a heavyset guy.  Clay would come in and buy for James Beard.  Sturgeon he loved, and chocolates.  It turns out that he was not allowed to eat, by his doctors, either salt products or sweets, but he kept the candies, I understood from Clay, under the bed, and the sturgeon he just ate right away.\nI remember after he died, Clay was floating around.  I would see him floating around on the Lower East Side, never came in after that.  That was the James Beard story.\n\nQ:  So he never came in, actually?\n\nFederman:  James Beard?  He did, but before my time.  Not when I was there.  They had their share of foodies.  Mimi Sheraton would come in, still does.  Calvin Trillin still does.  People come in and they get a sort of proprietary interest in Russ & Daughters, and it becomes something more than a commercial transaction.  You always have to give them the good product.  That’s without a doubt.  But they have a special attachment to it.\n\nQ:  When did you online business start to grow?\n\nFederman:  Well, so Niki, over my objection, developed this website, and she got her friends to do the—I don’t know even what they call it.  I mean, I just like opted out of this.\n\nQ:  Why was it over your objections?\n\nFederman:  Because we had never done business like that.  It was like too sort of futuristic for me.  I didn’t understand it.  My head wasn’t wrapping around it very well.\n\nQ:  This was how long ago?\n\nFederman:  2001.  I didn’t understand it and I didn’t want to deal with it.  I didn’t know if it would take off.  I didn’t know if it would crash everything around, we’d send a bad piece of something to somebody and it would bring down everything.  I just didn’t understand it, didn’t know it, didn’t want it, didn’t want the headache of it.  But it turns out by now to be a substantial portion of our business.\n\nQ:  How substantial?\n\nFederman:  I don’t know what the figures are, but I would imagine 20 percent of our business is online.\n\nQ:  And somebody packs it from here?\n\nFederman:  It’s all done here.  We built a whole new shipping department down in the basement, but that was largely because I got a contract for—I don’t know if it was a year or two, maybe it was one year, yes, one year and I gave it up, with Neiman-Marcus.  They wanted a package from us, a bagels and lox package.  I agreed to do it, but I realized I couldn’t deal with the volume, so I built a whole shipping, packing department in the basement.  Of course, we had a lot of product going out, but it was stupid.  We made no money.  I don’t know if we lost money on that thing.  They weren’t going to buy for a lot of money.  They were going to sell it for a lot of money, but they weren’t going to buy it for a lot of money.  So they billed it in their catalog, Russ & Daughters, the famous New York emporium, the best smoked fish, blah, blah, blah, with lox and [unclear], and it was just a lot of work.  We hand-sliced everything.  It was stupid.\n\tBut anyhow, as a result of that, the good thing that happened is that I built out this portion and another walk-in, so now we’re able to fulfill—everything is done here.  Again, this is not the kind of business you would choose, because you have to slice salmon a certain way, you have to pack it, it’s perishable, it costs us a lot of money.  It’s not your favorite kind of business.\n\nQ:  You said the best smoked-fish business.  That’s a major reputation to live up to.  How did you do that?\n\nFederman:  I’m not following the question.\n\nQ:  There are other people that sell smoked fish.  How do you keep this the best?\n\nFederman:  First of all, you have to be fearful.\n\nQ:  I see.  [laughter]\n\nFederman:  And you have to be egotistical.  You’re asking me questions I haven’t thought about.\n\nQ:  Do you remember I went with you to a smoked—whatever you call it, smokeree or whatever, smokehouse at one point, and I remember the floor was wet, but they obviously save you the good stuff, get you the good stuff?  How does that work?  You buy the good stuff, I guess.\n\nFederman:  Yes, we have to know what the good stuff is.  Part of it is learning a good piece of fish from a bad piece of fish, and that’s a process.  So, I mean, the story is that I asked my father, one of the first days I came in, I’m all puffed up, I’m a lawyer, I’m more educated than any member of my family before me—\n\nQ:  What you really need is boots to go to the smokehouse.  [laughter]\n\nFederman:  Who knew, right?  Okay.  I figure I’m going to learn it with one lesson.  “Teach me a good piece of fish from a bad piece of fish.”\n\tHe said, “We’ll go to the smokehouse and we’ll look at this and we’ll taste this and we’ll do this and we’ll bring it back to the store and we’ll—,” da-da-da-da.  And a whole litany of things.  And he said, “Okay.”\n\tI said, “That’s it?”\n\tHe said, “Yeah.  And then maybe after ten years you’ll know a good piece of fish from a bad piece of fish.”  So it’s this constant handling and whatever.  I figure I’m smarter than the rest of the Russes.  It took me maybe five years, and maybe it took me a little less to teach my nephew and my daughter that kind of thing.\nBut it basically is handling the product and tasting and whatever.  You can’t taste everything, so some of it you’ve got to know by feel.  You have to engage a lot of senses in doing this.  So that’s what we consider a bit of the art form of this thing, knowing good from bad.  You can’t decimate a good piece of fish because you want too—you can’t break it open and eat it, because the smoker’s not going to let you do it.\n\nQ:  But you also have to have the cooperation of the smoker, yes, to either save you the good things—\n\nFederman:  To get that.  Right.  To get that, you need to know what you’re doing, because if they sense that you don’t, they’ll—you know.  So you need to know what you’re doing, hopefully.  You need to buy in large volume.  They’re not going to mess around with a guy—everybody’s got a piece of lox in their showcase, but you’ve got to be buying hundreds of pieces of lox at a time.  And you’ve got to pay your bills.  They’re all from the old school, you know, they’ve inherited the same thing we did, so we pay their bills right away.  Hopefully after a while I knew what I was doing, and we sell a lot of fish, enough so that we could buy from lots of different places.  You don’t want to bury yourself with one smoker.  So this guy doesn’t have it today, maybe the other guy has it, and whatever.  Maybe his [unclear] are not so good, whatever, or the other guy burnt his whitefish and this guy didn’t today or tomorrow, whatever.\nSo it’s a lot of headaches and it’s all very expensive stuff, and you’ve got to remember, the smokers are buying huge quantities of fish.  They’re not buying a box of fish here.  They buy thousands of pounds of fish and smoking up hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds at a time, and not all of that is great fish, and yet they all look alike.\n\nQ:  So how do you learn?\n\nFederman:  So then you learn, right?  How do you distinguish, when you’re looking at two pieces of salmon that look pretty much the same, how do you determine which is the salmon that you want to sell in the store because the person who’s going to buy it is going to serve it to her whoever.  Her rabbi’s coming over for dinner or something, right?  So it’s about the buying, the knowing, the connections, whatever.\n\tBut this point, the fourth generation, my daughter and nephew, are dealing with some of the smokehouses of four generations also, so by this point there’s a connection and we are big-volume users of fish, so they want to please us.  Still, we’re very finicky because that’s what you inherit from my grandfather, is this demand for quality and cleanliness and whatever, you know.\n\nQ:  If you were to go into Zabar’s or somewhere else, can you tell the difference between what they’re selling and what you’re selling, or is there much difference or less volume?\n\nFederman:  No, no, no, no.  He’s got big volume and he has good fish.  You know, I wouldn’t downplay some of these places.  They have the ability to buy good fish.  There’s only a certain number of places that sell it, so hopefully if he’s on top of his game and he knows what he’s doing, he’s buying the right fish from that big batch of fish, and I’m buying the right piece of fish.  I like to say this is our specialty.  We’re not diffused by pots and pans or whatever.  But that’s not to say that you can’t get good fish other places.  Hopefully you can get the best fish here consistently, hopefully.  This is what we do.  Not every piece of fish tastes the same.  Not every fish is the same, not every portion of the fish is the same.  Again, it’s one of those businesses you wouldn’t choose.  If you have a genetic attachment to it, it’s okay.\n\nQ:  Is there a difference between smoked farmed fish and smoked wild fish?\n\nFederman:  Sure.  By now, most of the people that are the generation below me know pretty much only farmed fish and they don’t know about wild fish.  So that’s their model of, let’s say, salmon, the primary farm fish, should taste like.  Wild fish in its best, there’s nothing like it, you know.  But wild fish, because it’s wild, is subject to so many variables, so that one day it tastes like this, the next day it tastes like that, or it’s leaner or it’s fatter or it’s whatever, so you have all of these things.  Wild fish, also the texture if firmer in wild fish because it’s out there swimming in the wild, and the taste can change based upon what it’s feeding on.  It’s just a lot of variables, so it doesn’t necessarily taste the same today, next week, or whatever.\n\nQ:  When did it become impossible or at least wildly expensive to get—\n\nFederman:  Well, we still have wild fish.  We have wild Pacific king salmon that’s line-caught down there, but, number one, it’s more expensive.  Where the other salmon’s maybe thirty-something dollars a pound, that’s like forty-eight dollars a pound because it’s wild, and that’s being decimated, that Pacific king salmon thing.\n\nQ:  Who buys that?\n\nFederman:  Well, you know, some people like the taste of the wild salmon.  It’s stronger, more assertive, less fatty.  Some people like that.  Some people like the idea of buying wild salmon, so they’ll buy that because they just want to buy wild.  But there’s a market for it, but much less than the other salmons.  What happens in the farming business is that things get better because it’s a business and you have to improve the taste and texture and whatever, and now the concentration is on making sure the stuff you’re feeding these salmon are better, are organic or whatever, they’re not going to pollute the environment.  People are becoming more aware of that.\n\nQ:  Do you remember when you had to make the change to mostly—\n\nFederman:  I don’t know the year.\n\nQ:  Do you remember the feeling?\n\nFederman:  Well, the feeling is like they kept coming in, they want to buy this, whatever, and, you know, I would say no, but then the point is, okay, if you’re going to buy this salmon, you know, it’s based on the catch.  When it’s wild, it’s based on the catch.  Oh, we’re not catching it, so it’s not available, and if you want to buy it, it’s going to cost you five times as much, so you bring it in, but the customers don’t want to pay five times as much.  They’re going to put it on a bagel and cream cheese, you know.  And it looks the same to them.  That’s a portion of the public.  Another portion wants the wild salmon.  So you’re at the point where you’re changing over and a point where the wild salmon no longer makes sense for the smoker to handle because he’s able to—\n\nQ:  I see.  That’s where the difference would take place, at the smokehouse.\n\nFederman:  Yes, not at my level.  At the smokehouse.  He no longer wants to handle it or he can’t buy it because commercial fishing of Atlantic salmon just dies.  Maybe they put an embargo on the fishing of it for a while to see if it regenerates, and it never does.  I’m talking about Atlantic salmon.  It’s a different species.  Pacifica salmon, they’re always catching some some years or worse.  I don’t know of any years that’s better, so they’re always constantly going down.  Then they build the dams and the fish can’t go upstream, and they have oil leaks in the Alaskan bays.\n\nQ:  What about the changeover from lox to smoked salmon?  When did that happen?\n\nFederman:  I don’t know.  I’ve been rooting around, trying to figure this out.  My aunt and my mother are no help.  My father and uncles are dead.  The question is, when did that happen?  I think that it may have been that lox and smoked lox were sold initially, because they were smokers.  It was a German business smoking here, as far as I could tell, and then the Jews in the 1920s began to take over the smokehouses from the Germans.  They were smoking whitefish and carp, the available fish.  Then some sturgeon was plentiful then; it was being smoked.  Mackerel was being smoked and salmon was being smoked.  So salmon was being sold smoked.  Smoked lox and lox, unsmoked lox.\n\nQ:  What does smoked lox taste like?\n\nFederman:  It was salty.  It was still salty.  In the twenties and thirties, the salmon was largely coming from the Pacific.  It wasn’t Nova Scotia in those days.  What they were doing is huge amounts of salmon, so it was cheap.  In the thirties, I think my aunt remembers the price being like 9 cents a quarter of a pound.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nFederman:  Right?  So maybe it was a sale, 35 cents a pound.  Most of it was coming from the Pacific, with huge amounts of salmon, and from Alaska on down to California, and they were catching the salmon and they were dumping it into heavy salt brine, because there was no refrigerated rail at that point, and then what they called tierces, big wooden caskets that took like nine hundred pounds of salmon in brine.  So now we have the salmons that were split, gutted, and sitting in this very heavy salt brine as a preservative, because there’s no refrigeration, being shipped by rail to New York ports for transshipment to Europe and some of it staying here, and some of the smokers, who were German and then Jewish, smoked it with their other fish.  It was heavy smoked.  They’d just take it out of the tierce of salt and smoke it.  It was salty.  Then you had the salmon that wasn’t smoked, and people bought one or the other, but it was all salt product.  But still the Jew and the Eastern European had the taste for salt.  They were used to that saltiness.  Now people don’t want things salty.  So that’s what happened.\n\tThen I think it was not until the late thirties or forties that we had refrigerated railcars, we had now the ability to bring—not we, but the smokers, from Nova Scotia large amounts of salmon from that area down quickly.  You didn’t have to put it in heavy salt brine; you could bring it here and fresh-smoke it here without that strong salt, make it down here in a day.  I don’t know what they did.  But it was called a mild cure salmon, and they didn’t have to heavily salt it, and they could smoke it.  They would brine it here, add sugar to it.  They had what’s called a wet cure, be cured that way.\n\nQ:  At some point people referred to Nova, and it seemed to me that what they were talking about was the difference between smoked fish and cured fish, lox and smoked fish.  Is that what Nova meant at that point?\n\nFederman:  Nova meant different things to different people, just like lox does, so it’s all sort of conflated and confused.  They’re all cured.  Smoked fish is all cured, meaning it’s in a salt.  What happens, this allows for smoking the fish to take up the flavor and it’s a preservative.  It’s an osmotic process, osmosis.  So it all has to be salt-cured.  The amount of salt used is regulated now by the government.  You can’t use less of a certain amount as a preservative of these things.  So it’s all cured.  The question is how heavy the salt is.  You can’t be less than a minimum, but how heavy the salt curing is, when the sugar is put in, and then most of it gets smoked, whether it’s whitefish, sturgeon, [unclear].  Then the processes are cold-smoked, which the oven has been—and that’s what happened when you’re buying what you call Nova, smoked salmon, it’s all cold-smoked.  It’s cured and then smoked at maybe 75 degrees maximum, and the smoke is generated outside.  The room is blown in over the salmon, sort of been cured already for a period of time.\n\tOr hot-smoking with whitefish and sturgeon and most of the other fish and baked salmon, what we call [unclear] salmon, are hot-smoked, which means they’re cured again, but they’re put in ovens and the temperature goes to maybe 160, 170 degrees, so it’s actual oven cooking process and you get a different texture.  You get a flaky texture.\n\nQ:  But just plain lox?\n\nFederman:  Just plain lox was just salt-cured, not smoked, and mostly referred to—lox, the word, is anglicized from the German lachs, meaning salmon, so the initial lox, that word anglicized, was about the specific salmons early on that were just caught, dressed, meaning filleted—well, not really filleted.  The bones were in.  But gutted, split, and dumped in these heavy salt brine things, and then either sold, not smoked or smoked, so lox unsmoked or smoked lox, which was smoked.  Then you get these smoked salmons coming in, the Nova Scotia salmon or Pacific salmon, and then salmons from around the world.\n\nQ:  Nobody ever asks for gravlax here?\n\nFederman:  Plenty of gravlax.  Yes, gravlax is just cured and dill and sugar and salt.\n\nQ:  So you sell that here too?\n\nFederman:  Yes.  Now we’re into selling lots of—there’s probably ten different kinds of smoked salmon in the store now, so where we started this conversation was about three, lox, unsmoked, just cured salted salmon, and Nova Scotia Atlantic salmon and Nova Pacifica salmon, that was it.  So now there’s like salmons from all over the world, and most of it is farmed, but we have wild Pacific salmon, still, and some of the salmons from Ireland, from Scotland, from Denmark, they have some general distinguishing characteristics to it, but that changes also.\n\nQ:  Can you taste the difference or can anybody?\n\nFederman:  I can because I have a palette for the stuff.  It’s my business.  If you’re going to put it on a bagel, particularly the bagels that exist today, these big roll-y things, and a lot of cream cheese, you know, it doesn’t really matter, but if you’re going to pay attention to what you’re eating, then some fish you can.  I have downstairs—I gave you a taste the other day—this Danish salmon which is double smoked and a different color, smoked in Denmark with a richer maybe peat or something that gives a different flavor to it.  It’s just wonderful salmon.\n\nQ:  It’s delicate.\n\nFederman:  There’s no point in putting that on a bagel with cream cheese, to me.  Just like what’s the point?  But just to eat it on a cracker with a little fresh pepper on it or just with nothing, it’s spectacular.\n\nQ:  When people in catering order platters, what kind of—\n\nFederman:  Depends on the platter.  We give them a choice of what they want, and then we make a platter of just different kinds of smoked salmon, so they have a platter of five or six different kinds of salmon, or in the standard platter that we make, it’s usually Gaspe salmon, which is the traditional.  It’s basically the same kind as the traditional Nova Scotia that most people like to taste.  It’s mild, it’s delicate, it’s rich.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you tell me about deciding to, as it were, retire.\n\nFederman:  Well, it’s clearly something I never thought about.  Why did I decide to retire?  I was getting to the point where I’d ridden this wave that was crashing.  I came in when the business was really going down.  Business was going down, the neighborhood was going down, and I spent a lot of energy keeping every customer we had and trying to make new customers.  That was my energy.  It was very, as I said, existential.\nThen we just got lucky with the wave that had changed the food world and the neighborhood.  In the food world, people were starting to appreciate.  As the food world got more homogenized and glitzy and big-box-store-y and whatever, then there was that portion that was growing of people who appreciated these little jewel-y kind of places.  They wanted the experience of shopping here, and for most of them, they recognized that we were going to give them a superior product.  So they were going to get not only the product, but they were going to get an experience of what happens when you’re in a store like this and you’re having a communication with the guy who’s selling it to you and you’re watching his hands slice that salmon, as opposed to buying a packaged something.  So you have that, and then in the location where the store pretty much looks like always did in a neighborhood where it always existed.  So that’s a whole other kind of experience.  As the world got away from this, people appreciated it.\nThen the neighborhood started to change in the late eighties, I would say, and then it wasn’t just the druggies and prostitutes and criminals, but always with that there was also the artists and the musicians who lived down here because it was cheap rent.  They would float in and out of here and buy a bagel or whatever.\n\nQ:  It was cheap.\n\nFederman:  Yes.  And people started to recognize this is sort of a cool place.  Then it started to transform itself.  It usually does.  Then people started to move in to be close to this energy that was happening down here.  Some of it was the energy of freefall and some of it was this artistic energy.  So then people wanted to be close to it, particularly young people, and as they moved in, prices went up, the buildings got renovated and the artists couldn’t live here anymore.  But it’s typical of the gentrification, if you want to call it that.\n\tWhat line am I on here?  What am I talking about?\n\nQ:  Retirement.  But I must say, as you’re talking about this, I’m also thinking about Whole Foods up the street.  But anyway, go ahead.\n\nFederman:  Whole Foods up the street, that’s interesting also.\n\nQ:  When did first your nephew, is that right—\n\nFederman:  First Niki, and then Niki left and there was no sense of her coming back.  She was going to get an MBA at Yale and she was going to do something.  At that point I didn’t know I lost her.  I said, “What do you need to go there?  I’ll teach you whatever you want to know right here,” but she didn’t want me to teach her, and there was no sense of her coming back.  She wanted to cut the tie once and for all and go off in the world.\n\tWhen that happened, my nephew, Josh, who had been from time to time, “Hey, Uncle Mark, want me to come in the business?”  He was an engineer on [unclear] working for some big companies.  I don’t even know.  I keep asking him what kind of engineer.  I didn’t know there were more than one kinds.  He was chemical or civil or something, I have no idea, doing something with chips.  It’s a world I know nothing about.  But it seems that he was similarly not happy, not unhappy, but not feeling—“fulfilled” is sort of a trite word.  He was feeling something missing from his life and he wanted to reconnect through the family, because he had sort of a weird family upbringing.  He was brought up on an ashram, because my sisters, in the sixties, you know, everybody in the sixties were all looking for something.\n\nQ:  Remind me who his parents are.\n\nFederman:  There’s three of us.  His mother is my eldest sister, Tara.  She’s two years older than me.  My younger sister is Hope. She’s three and a half years younger.  My oldest, Tara, is two years older than me, my younger sister is three and a half years younger than me.  I’m in the middle.  \nSo Tara, in the sixties, his mother, she was artsy-fartsy and whatever, and she suddenly found herself in the communal world of an ashram.  It was upstate, they moved to California with the guru, and then my younger sister followed that lifestyle, and I was in college in law school and then in the army.  I was following whatever path I thought I was supposed to follow at the moment.\n\tSo my nephew Josh—and he has two sisters—was raised on an ashram, in a communal environment, and his parents were, you know, that spirit.  They had nothing to do with the business here.  They lived upstate, it was a different kind of lifestyle.  They would come into the store once a year, whatever.  My sister would bring them down.  They would run behind the candy counter and take some candy, and that was their experience.  So for him to call me now, when he was an engineer working on the West Coast, and say, “Hey, Uncle Mark, what about me coming into the business?”  And I would constantly say, “Josh, I mean, what do you want?  This is hard.  You don’t know anything about it.”\n\tBut when Niki left and I had had this notion that, okay, I would retire, I would work with Niki for a while and ease out, I had this really romantic notion of working with my daughter, easing out, and by this point, you know, business had gotten better.  The neighborhood got better.  We were getting more famous, you know, and I didn’t have the energy to do it anymore.  This turns out to be tough.  It’s wearing physically because you’re standing on the counter, emotionally, dealing with all the little problems.  I used to look at all these other businesses and they’d multiply.  I’d say, “How do they do this?  How do they run these big businesses?”  I couldn’t get it.  For me it was about watching each sale, each piece of fish, each customer.  I don’t know why I trapped myself like that.  On the other hand, on reflection, it seems it wasn’t such a trap; it’s what I wanted.  I didn’t have grand goals of taking over the world.  I wanted to do the best I could in my corner of the world, the little fish corner of the world in the Lower East Side.\n\tAnyhow, so when I thought I had Niki here and then it became apparent that there would be a succession and then I would have an exit plan, I got very happy, and then Niki left sort of precipitously and I got very unhappy, and I couldn’t muster the energy to think about continuing each day opening the store in the morning, bringing the fish in, facing the same customers.  I was just getting too old for that.  This business will wear you down.  And that’s about when Josh called and said, “Hey, Uncle Mark.  What do you think?”\n\tAnd at this point I said, “Josh, come on in.  I have no idea.  We’ll see what you can do.”  And Josh came in here, and I was very hesitant with Josh because he had no experience in this and he had a different sort of mentality, more corporate, and then I didn’t think he could do it alone.  I tried to make a shidduch.  You know what a shidduch is?  A marriage between Josh and Herman, who was my manager for years now, and that took a lot of sort of energy in trying to figure out how to make that work.  One way was to take myself out of the profit scheme of things, pick myself a minimal salary and turn my profit over to them so they could divide it, to understand if they made money, it was based on their efforts.  So I did that.\n\nQ:  When was that?\n\nFederman:  That was 2003, ’04, ’05, I don’t know.  I did that, and still something missing.  I wasn’t quite comfortable that the two of them could continue it on.  They had the passion, they had the ability, but I wasn’t quite sure of the dynamic.  And then someplace along the line, Niki said, “Hey, Dad, I want to come back in the business.”  She’d been out now in the world, trying various things for three years or so.\n\tI said, “Niki.”  I immediately got protective of my bodily functions, my heart mostly, and said, “Niki, this no longer has anything to do with me.  I will not make a judgment on this.  You need to clear it through Josh and Herman.  They’re running the business.”\n\tSo she did.  They said okay.  She came in a trial period before they cut her in equally.\n\nQ:  This was?\n\nFederman:  This was around 2006, maybe, ’07.  You can’t ask me dates.  \nThen the three of them, and then Maria, who kept on—I made Maria an equal partner of the business someplace along the time, because it seemed to me that she was doing the yeoman’s work and she ought to be invested in it, so she had held on.  Even when I gave up my portion of the profit, she had kept hers, and then when her daughter came in here, she gave hers up so there would be more of a pie for the three of them to divide up.  So then we just became salaried whatever.\nThen Niki came in, then the three of them had been sort of working out their dynamic, and I think largely it works very well.  Niki and Josh, the dynamic there, they complement each other because Niki is this big, expansive person now.  She’ll walk into a room and light up a room.  Everybody I see, “Oh, Niki, your daughter, is the best.”  She’s this, she’s that.  She cares about people.  She shows she cares.  She cares about Russ & Daughters.  She’s carrying on the legacy.  Josh is an engineer, he’s more withdrawn and quiet and less verbal and vocal, but Josh, I love Josh.  Maybe I admire him too.  He can get from Point A to Point B in a straight line.  He’s an engineer, and you need that in business too.  So the two of them are able to do that.  When I came to criticize something, they immediately circled their two wagons and I didn’t get it.  I was the boogey man.  I was from the old school.  I was the dinosaur.\nAnd Herman, I had to teach him the things, a good fish from a bad fish, even a good customer from a bad customer, but my presence is a critical presence.  Didn’t work so well particularly with my daughter, because there’s all that family kind of baggage.  But Herman had been trained by me, so he was there in the mix to present the way that we had done business.  \nSo it seems to me that it has, for the most part, worked out spectacularly well.  I’m very confident now that they’re running the business actually better than I ever have.  The numbers are better.  I come in, the customers are happy, the press is happy, the suppliers are happy, and I come in, and the most important thing to me is I come in and I eat what I want and I taste.  That’s part of the deal in the transfer.  You don’t have to pay me a lot of money, but let me eat what I want.  But the importance of that is, I taste.  I pick up the sturgeon, I feel it, I taste it, and the salmon, and the fish is as good, if not better, so they’re able to stay on top of the product, which is ultimately, no matter how great a schmoozer you are or how famous your business is, you’ve got to deliver consistently good product to the customer.  And they’re doing that.  So, you know, I kvel. \n\nQ:  This is terrific.  Thank you very much.\n\n[End of interview]\n","description":"Mark Federman's family business is Russ & Daughters on the Lower East Side.

Lewis, Janet Flanner, into the world of food.\r\n\r\nWorking at night after he finished his day job, Ferrone began, out of a devotion to the friendship, editing scores of Beard's articles. Eventually he worked on some of Beard's books and continued to do so (as Beard's literary executor) after his death.

Ferrone continues to steward Beard's books and attempt keep them in print.TTT\n\nInterviewee:  John Ferrone\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t        New York City\n\nDate:  March 3, 2009\n\n\n\nQ:  It’s March third.  I’m with John Ferrone at his home on West 13th Street in the Village, and we’re going to begin our interview now.\n\tJohn, if you could just tell me where and when you were born and tell me a little something about your early life and education, and then we’ll go on from there.\n\nFerrone:  I’ll start at the very, very beginning.  I was born in Morristown, New Jersey, in a hospital and grew up in a small town in Morris County, Rockaway, not to be confused with Rockaway in New York, population four thousand.  So I’m really a small-town boy.\nI was the youngest of five children in an immigrant Italian family.  My mother and father both immigrated.  My mother arrived when she was nine, so she was really quite Americanized by the time I came along.  My father spoke very little English.  I never had a conversation with him in all of my life; my mother used to interpret for us.\n\nQ:  How old was he when he came to this country?\n\nFerrone:  Around nineteen.  My mother was a good cook, intuitive cook.  Because she arrived in this country when she was nine, she didn’t come armed with a treasury of Italian recipes.  Everything she cooked that was Italian, my father taught her.  We only had spaghetti, as it was called, never pasta.  We had spaghetti once a week, so we were pretty Americanized, and we were helped along in that regard by an older sister who was determined that we were not going to be ordinary immigrants.  She was pretty cultural-minded.  She went to concerts and lectures, and encouraged my creativity.\n\nQ:  How much older was she?\n\nFerrone:  Thirteen years older.  She more or less raised me.  She was my surrogate mother.\nI went to the local high school, graduated at the head of my class, and had two small jobs before I went off to the war.  First, I worked at a sporting goods store which sold records, and I ran the record department.  Then I got a job as a secretary at an iron ore mine.  There were no women employed there, so I was the secretary till I went off to World War II at the age of nineteen, and I served for close to three years.  I was with an outfit called the Radio Security Detachment.  We monitored our own radio transmissions for violations of security.\n\nQ:  Where was this?\n\nFerrone:  We were all over the United States.  I went to school, radio school, in Madison, Wisconsin, and was transferred to Drew Field in Florida.  I was at Fort Meade in Maryland, Peterson Field in Colorado Springs, spent some time in Arlington just before going overseas for an intensive course, a high security course, and was there when Roosevelt died.\n\nQ:  In Arlington?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  Shipped overseas with a small group from my outfit in spring of 1944.  No, wrong.  I think it was ’45.  It was my first trip on a plane, and it was a 7,000-mile trip in bucket seats.\n\nQ:  Destination?\n\nFerrone:  Guam.  So I spent the next several months, not quite a year, on Guam.  We arrived too late to be of any good to anybody, but it was the closest I came to the real war.  I was shipped back in February 1946, went back to my old job.\n\nQ:  Which old job was that?\n\nFerrone:  At the iron ore mine.  Now I was a bookkeeper.  Then I went off to college, Colorado College in 1947, in February 1947.  I applied to Columbia, they turned me down, and then I decided I would go to Drew University in Madison, New Jersey, which would have meant living at home.  But at the last minute, a WAC that I had met in the army said she was going to Colorado College—and that’s where I’d met her, at Colorado Springs—said why didn’t I go to Colorado College.  I thought it was a great idea, so off I went.  I spent two years there, but I wanted creative writing, and they didn’t offer it.  I applied to Harvard and Stanford, Harvard turned me down.  Stanford accepted me.\n\nQ:  How did you know you wanted to do creative writing?  What was in your mind at that point?\n\nFerrone:  I had done a lot of writing in my high school years.\n\nQ:  What kind?\n\nFerrone:  Nonfiction.  And had won a writing contest that my English teacher arranged.  She encouraged me to write.  I just felt it.\n\nQ:  Had you at that point been speaking Italian at home, or no?\n\nFerrone:  I spoke no Italian.  My mother, as I said, translated between me and my father.  She spoke English with no accent.  I think possibly, too, because of my father’s inability to learn the language, language became more important to me.  I was compensating for him in some strange way.  I also took courses in writing and English, correspondence courses.  When I was in the army on Guam, I was taking correspondence courses in English.\n\nQ:  In prose writing or—\n\nFerrone:  Essay writing, I think.  And my commanding officer even invited me to vet his letters.  There I was with a high school education, and another of my colleagues in the army and I had to write reports based on the radio transmissions, the logs that men in our detachment would transcribe.  So we would prepare these pretentious reports on the dangers of security lapses.  I was doing a lot of writing of one sort or another.\nSo off I went to Stanford in fall of 1948 to major in creative writing.  I began writing stories there.\n\nQ:  Fiction?\n\nFerrone:  Fiction.  I had three stories published in the quarterly magazine put out at Stanford called the Pacific Spectator, and I had one story published by a quarterly called Epoch, which emanated from Cornell University.  I studied with Wallace Stegner.\n\nQ:  Did you really?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.  That must have been the best possible education.\n\nFerrone:  He was a wonderful man, and we became friends, really.  I visited him whenever I went to California after I graduated.\n\nQ:  Was it obvious what a fine writer he was at that point?\n\nFerrone:  Oh yes, and he was a help in getting me a creative writing fellowship.\n\nQ:  Where was this?  At Stanford?\n\nFerrone:  At Stanford, yes.  There was a professor emeritus named Edith Miralees, who was also quite interested in me and my writing, and she was editor of the Pacific Spectator for a number of years.  So on the strength of getting the creative writing fellowship, I made my first trip to Europe in 1950, and that was the beginning of the trail that led to Beard, really.\n\nQ:  How so?\n\nFerrone:  Because a friend in California at Stanford said, “When you’re in Italy, Rome, look up my friend Ted Hitchcock.”  It was an elderly man who worked for the Rome Daily American newspaper and who later appeared briefly in the film Roman Holiday.\nWhen I moved to New York in 1953, Ted wrote and said, “Look up my friend Paul Bernard,” a man who, I believe, was in advertising.  Then when I moved to 12th Street in 1954, Paul noted that I was living a few doors away from James Beard.  He says, “You two ought to get to know each other.”  So that was the beginning of thirty years of friendship and a professional relationship.\n\nQ:  What did you do after you got back from that European trip?\n\nFerrone:  I got my master’s degree in creative writing.\n\nQ:  At Stanford?\n\nFerrone:  At Stanford.  Then Stegner got me a job at the Stanford University Press, where I was an apprentice editor, and I worked there for only about a year and a half.\nWhen I came back to New York one Christmas holiday, a woman I know who was at Stanford had moved to New York, and I spent the weekend here.  New York looked so glamorous and exciting, I decided it was time to come back east.  So I packed up, got a ride with a fellow student who was driving cross country, and arrived in New York in March 1953.\n\nQ:  Any job prospects in mind?\n\nFerrone:  Again, a whole chain of friends who were responsible for my getting my first job.  Again, a friend in California said look up a friend in New York who was in publishing.  I think he worked for Bobbs Merrill at that point, Bill Raney.  Bill sent me to Frank Taylor, who was then editor-in-chief of Dell Books.  Dell Books were packaged by an editorial staff working for Western Printing and Lithographing Company, but we acquired the books, did everything, and Dell was really the distributor and publisher.  They were mass-market books.  When I arrived, they were still not quite respectable.\n\nQ:  Dell?\n\nFerrone:  Mass-market books.  But it was the beginning of a shift to trade paperbacks.  We began to produce classics with introductions by well-known academics, and I started off as a reader and became an editor.\n\nQ:  After about how long?\n\nFerrone:  Oh, after about a year, I would think.\n\nQ:  Now, in those days, editors really edited, right?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  That’s so different now.  So, once you had a book in hand, how did you approach that?\n\nFerrone:  Well, we were largely reprinters at that point, but we started up something called first editions, which were original books.  One of the more offbeat things that I produced during that period was a collection of pieces by Noel Coward, short stories, plays, and lyrics.  He’d just had his comeback triumph in Las Vegas.  It was about 1952 or ‘53.\n\nQ:  Did you know him, or how did you get that assignment?\n\nFerrone:  I think it was on the strength of his publicity in Las Vegas, I thought it would make a sellable book, and I was indulged in it.\n\nQ:  You asked if you could approach him?\n\nFerrone:  I just asked if we could do it, and he agreed to it, and when he was in New York, I went to visit him at Hampton House.  I wasn’t given credit for putting together the anthology, but they needed a name.  The name that we came up with at that point was a writer for the New York Times, Gilbert Milstein.  Means nothing nowadays, but he was a feature writer at that point, and we both went to see Coward at Hampton House.  And there was one song, the lyrics to which I couldn’t—I couldn’t find the lyrics to one song, and Coward dictated “Mad About the Boy” to me.  Milstein was very fawning, and Coward kept slapping him down.  [laughs]  He was very nice to me.  But that’s just one of numbers of original projects that began to crop up in the midst of these reprints.\n\nQ:  And the company let you do these original projects?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  We also put out the first guide to LP records, and for that I secured the endorsement of Stokowski and went to visit him.  I think he was then married to Gloria Vanderbilt or had just ceased being married to her.\nThey were exciting years and entertaining years.  Frank Taylor was a rather charming, flamboyant character and entrepreneur.  I don’t think he ever edited a thing, but he had taste and an instinct for hiring the right people to work for him.  I worked with the Dell group for, I think, eleven years, until Western Printing and Dell split.  Most of us from the editorial staff were invited to go with Dell and continue.  A number of us stayed behind and set up a new publishing company, a new publishing imprint, which didn’t really get off the ground.\n\nQ:  You were part of that group?\n\nFerrone:  Part of that group, yes.\n\nQ:  And the idea was to publish what kind of things?\n\nFerrone:  Just general trade publishing.  That fell apart, and I stayed on for another incarnation under Albert Leventhal, who used to run Golden Books.  That fell apart, and I was unemployed for about six months.\n\nQ:  This would have been when?\n\nFerrone:  1964 or 1965.  When I heard about the job opening up at Harcourt Brace, they were looking for a paperback editor.  They had had a paperback line for a number of years, but it was done with a left hand by the editors.  They had nobody in charge.  So I took over as editor of Harvest Books and was with Harcourt for twenty-six years, eventually doing hardcover books as well as paperbacks.\n\nQ:  How did it develop that you began to work with the incredibly distinguished literary writers that you worked with?\n\nFerrone:  Well, first of all, I reprinted many of them.\n\nQ:  Reprinted.  Who would that have been?\n\nFerrone:  Well, Alice Walker for one, Virginia Woolf, Eudora Welty, Anais Nin.\n\nQ:  Reprinted them for the American paperback market?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  Harvest Books was a trade paperback imprint.  I also handled a line of books that was done in conjunction with the college department.  They were trade paperbacks that were done by academics, but they weren’t textbooks.  It was called Harbinger Books.  There was a third paperback line for, well, young readers, not children, but teenage readers, called Harbrace Paperbound Library, which included the more popular books, My Sister Eileen, and that sort of thing, Miracle on 34th Street.\n\tAnd then I got involved with the children’s books.  They were called Voyager Books.  So I reprinted those and had to deal with children’s book authors, including the infamous Pamela Travers of Mary Poppins fame.  So I was handling five paperback imprints plus an occasional hardcover book.\n\nQ:  And since they were some of them reprinted, did that mean that you could edit any of them?  How did that work?\n\nFerrone:  No, they were just reprinted as they were.  As I may have told you, I served as the American editor for the Virginia Woolf books.  First of all, no one in the trade department seemed interested in Virginia Woolf besides me.  I saw that all of the books of hers that were out of print were brought back into print, and I was the American editor for Quentin Bell’s biography of her, and it went on from there.\n\nQ:  This would have been about when?\n\nFerrone:  In the early seventies.  So I was American editor for the diaries and letters and other Bloomsbury books.  I was also editor of several posthumous collections of works by C.S. Lewis, letters, stories.\n\nQ:  Now, how did it happen then that you began to work with Anais Nin and Alice Walker and Eudora Welty?  Which came first?\n\nFerrone:  I’m just trying to think of the order of things.  Anais Nin, her editor at Harcourt was originally a man named Hiram Haydn, a very distinguished editor who helped found Atheneum.  Hiram died.  He was an elderly man.  I’m just trying to think whether—I had probably reprinted the first volume of Anais’s diary.  She came to my office to see me.  That was 1969.  So when Hiram died, I took over as her full-time editor.\n\nQ:  And what did that mean?  Presumably they were published in Europe first, or were they?\n\nFerrone:  No.\n\nQ:  They were published here first?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  I see.  So then what role did you have in the actual books—volumes, rather?\n\nFerrone:  Well, I was fully editing at that point.\n\nQ:  Could you describe to me what that meant?\n\nFerrone:  Line editing, not merely acquisition.  I was always a hands-on editor, which worked with some authors and not with others.  Alice Walker, for example, was a more prickly person to work with, although we got along, but I didn’t retreat.  I felt I wasn’t doing my authors any good if I was in awe of them.  So Alice came to me in the same way, through the death of her editor.  She was originally published by Hiram Haydn also, her first book of poetry.  Hiram died, and she was handed over to a British editor—well, he was working for Harcourt.  Tony Godwin.  Tony died of a heart attack, and Alice was left high and dry at Harcourt, and her agent came to me and asked me to take over, because Alice was pleased with the work I had done in reprinting her earlier volumes.\nEudora Welty was another.  That was simply a case of my admiring her work, and we had published most of her short stories.\n\nQ:  What was she like?  To work with, that is.\n\nFerrone:  Wonderful, humble, modest, cooperative.\n\nQ:  Rare.\n\nFerrone:  It took a while to get all the rights assembled so I could do the collected stories.  But the collected stories brought her enormous acclaim, won the National Book Award and really launched her in a way that she hadn’t been before.  And we became very good friends.  Over a period of ten years, she used to visit me at my farm in Pennsylvania for weekends.\n\nQ:  Now, with people of this stature, what kind of a role did you have in actually shaping any of the words or presentation?\n\nFerrone:  With the collected stories, I would have no shaping to do.  It was largely administrative work.  But in the case of Alice Walker and Nin, yes, there was raw material worked on.\n\nQ:  How raw?\n\nFerrone:  Well, both finished, accomplished writers, so when I say raw, a bit of editing here and there.\n\nQ:  And, meanwhile, what was your life in New York like?  Were you enjoying New York?\n\nFerrone:  Tremendously.  The fifties were great.  Sixties were very unsettling, weren’t they?  I can’t see it in decades really beyond that.  It just flows.\n\nQ:  What did you have time to do yourself?  I mean, presumably you got to know a lot of people.  What kind of a personal life were you leading?\n\nFerrone:  It was very exciting, because I had so many people who were enriching my life.  There was Beard in the food world and other food people.  I worked with Walter Terry on a guide to the ballet, so he would haul me off to the ballet frequently.  And there was Emily Coleman, who was a music and dance critic for Newsweek magazine, and I got taken off to the opera and concerts.  Who else?\n\nQ:  Where were you living?  What kind of apartment situation did you have?\n\nFerrone:  I started off on 12th Street in a tiny studio apartment, third-floor walk-up.  I had three sticks of furniture.  I was poor.  Then I moved to a one-bedroom apartment on 8th Street, where I was quite happy for a number of years until 8th Street began to deteriorate.  And then a friend of Beard’s, Agnes White, an interior designer, found this apartment for me.\n\nQ:  This one?\n\nFerrone:  This one.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nFerrone:  That was about 1965.\n\nQ:  So you would have been how old, approximately, then?\n\nFerrone:  About forty-four.\n\nQ:  It’s a great apartment.\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  How did she find it?\n\nFerrone:  She had a real estate agency which her husband used to run, William Alfred White.  He died and she inherited it.  She was a close Portland friend of Beard’s.  She knew him from Oregon days.\n\nQ:  Before you met Beard, were you interested in food at all?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  I was a decent cook with a very limited repertoire.  I made an awful lot of chicken cacciatore in those days.  I had a few dishes, but I did pretty well.\n\nQ:  Was it like your mother’s cooking?\n\nFerrone:  Well, not really.  I don’t know how I picked it up.  There was a time at Colorado College when I batched with three Jewish guys.  We took turns cooking.  None of us knew how to cook, really, and they were all music students.  They had an apartment with a woman named Carol Truaz, who was a fine cook and had produced a book called the Sixty-Minute Chef.  So we learned from that.  That was my first cookbook.\n\nQ:  And you just continued when you got to New York, or how did that work?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  Well, when I met Beard, I began to pick up things immediately.  He was my mentor, of course.\n\nQ:  How did you meet him?\n\nFerrone:  Well, as I said earlier, when I moved to 12th Street after my being in New York about six months, a mutual friend noted the fact that Jim and I lived only a few doors apart from each other, and he thought we should get to know each other, and gave Jim my telephone number and me Jim’s number.  I don’t know who called whom first.\n\nQ:  What was he like at that point?\n\nFerrone:  Always, always good company, charming, generous, interested in everything, not only food, but music, books, politics, gossip.\n\nQ:  I noticed in the list of articles that you gave me and the list of meals, that the meals preceded the articles by about ten years, so I wasn’t sure what that meant, whether—\n\nFerrone:  The meals preceded the articles.\n\nQ:  You started having meals about ten years before you started helping him with his articles.\n\nFerrone:  That was because he was working with a friend named Isabel Callvert for the beginning years.  She was a Portlander, a radio actress from Jim’s early days there, and she worked with him on three of his cookbooks, early cookbooks and articles.\nSo I didn’t kick in until The James Beard Cookbook, which was published in 1959, and that came about—I’d known Jim for about a year.  Well, I told my boss, Frank Taylor, that Jim was available for a cookbook.  He’d had four cookbooks published at that point, and my boss was interested in this news.  So the question was what kind of a cookbook would he write.  There’s always been some question about how he came to ask him to write a basic cookbook.  I seem to remember it was Frank’s wife, Nan Taylor, who was a good cook, who said that we really hadn’t had a good basic cookbook since Fannie Farmer, and that’s what Jim should do.  So that’s how the basic idea came along.\nFrank invited Jim and me along with his wife, Nan, to Chambord to present this proposal.  Chambord was then the upscale French restaurant in New York in those days.  And Jim accepted the proposal.  I remember the meal was sumptuous.  For four of us it cost $110, which was astronomical.\n\nQ:  And this was what year?\n\nFerrone:  1955, I would say.\n\nQ:  So about that time, who were you editing in a literary way?  Certainly you had a full plate.\n\nFerrone:  At that time, I was largely reprinting.  We were doing reprints of the classics and working with academics on introductions.  I worked with a long list of academics.\n\nQ:  I guess what I’m getting at is how was publishing a cookbook, even with James Beard, seen in the publishing world?\n\nFerrone:  It was very unusual, because it was an original cookbook in paperback.  Normally it would have been published in hardcover first and then reprinted.\n\nQ:  And why was it in paperback first?\n\nFerrone:  Because we had this [unclear] line of first editions.  We were creating new books.  The book actually was reprinted in hardcover later, so it reversed the usual process, but it was a huge success.  He did it in collaboration with Isabel Callvert.  It got some publicity from Craig Claiborne in the New York Times just before it appeared, and the book was sold out in all the bookstores and newsstands in New York and even on the Dell’s list.  It even outsold his number one fiction book, Anatomy of a Murder.  In his first year of publication, it sold 150,000 copies.\n\nQ:  Oh, my heavens.  And that would have been—\n\nFerrone:  1959.\n\nQ:  Wow.  A hundred and fifty thousand copies was huge then.\n\nFerrone:  A mass-market distribution was in those numbers.  And next month we celebrate its fiftieth anniversary.  It’s been continuously in print all these years.\n\nQ:  As a paperback?\n\nFerrone:  No, his hardcover editions and paperback.\n\nQ:  Now, he had worked with Isabelle on that, but then as time went on, did you take over as the editor for that?\n\nFerrone:  That was the beginning of my editorial involvement with him.\n\nQ:  Could you tell me about that?\n\nFerrone:  When it came time to find an editor for his Delights and Prejudices, his agent turned to me.  That would have been about 1962.  And I was handed a manuscript, I may have told you, on onionskin, single spaced, totally unorganized, just a clump of patches of writing.  So I had to organize it into chapters and suggest places where it could be filled out, suggested new chapters.  Jim and the agent were so pleased with the results that I really got the job of working with him on articles.\n\nQ:  Tell me what you mean by that, the job of working with him on articles.\n\nFerrone:  Well, he was writing for House and Garden, Woman’s Day, Gourmet, although for Gourmet for a short time only, and he, in those days, used to type out his material.  The notion that he had a ghost writer was certainly inaccurate.  This really was raw material.  He would bang out his article, had no interest in shaping it further or polishing it, he was done with it, and he needed someone to polish it and organize it properly.\n\nQ:  Why do you think he had no interest in doing that?\n\nFerrone:  He didn’t consider himself to be a good writer.  He just wasn’t interested in himself as a writer, though the material was all there, the authority, the charm, the energy, the creativity, but he just didn’t want to look at it again after he’d pounded it out.\n\nQ:  So what would happen?\n\nFerrone:  That’s where I came in.  I enjoyed polishing, rewriting.  So I would have a full-time job.  I’d come home in the evenings and do food work.\n\nQ:  What were you doing in your full-time job at that point?\n\nFerrone:  At which point?\n\nQ:  When you would come home and work on his articles.\n\nFerrone:  Well, I was working on all the things I’ve discussed.\n\nQ:  What years are we talking about, the years of those first articles?\n\nFerrone:  It would have been from the sixties and seventies.\n\nQ:  By that time, what was your friendship like?  Was it close, was it—\n\nFerrone:  It was very close.\n\nQ:  Sometimes it can be hard to try and edit material from somebody who is a close friend.  Did he have any, I don’t know, pride of ownership in the words or anything like that?\n\nFerrone:  No.  I never got any feedback after I would turn in a completed article.  He would never say, “That’s fine.  That’s just what I wanted.  That sounds like me.”  Nothing.  He was done with it.  I had the feeling that he felt a little bit abashed, the fact that it really wasn’t completely his own work.\n\nQ:  What gave you that feeling?\n\nFerrone:  I was just trying to interpret his silence.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Were you spending a lot of time together at that point?\n\nFerrone:  Well, we’d always lived close by, because he lived, first of all, on 10th Street, and I lived on 8th Street and then here, and he moved from 10th to 12th, so he was just around the corner.  I would pop in to see him.  I should mention the time, too, when he was living on 8th Street, I stopped in to see him after work one day, and he was having a heart attack.  And at that point, his companion, Gino Cofacci, was in residence, but he didn’t want to bother Gino.\nSo I rushed to the phone, called his doctor, and said, “Get an ambulance and get him to Doctors’ Hospital.”  So the ambulance came.  They wanted to be paid in advance for the trip, so this poor man, who’s having a heart attack, had to sign a blank check.  I rode in the ambulance with him to Doctors’ Hospital, and we got into a traffic jam near Gracie Mansion.  I thought Jim wasn’t going to make it, but finally they got him installed, and he survived very nicely.  And the period following when he was recuperating was a real circus in his hospital room.  There were balloons.\n\nQ:  That really was a circus.  [laughs]\n\nFerrone:  Restaurant Associates sent him splits of champagne and lump crabmeat all packed in ice for visitors.  All his friends would sneak in food for him.  Alvin Kerr, who worked for Gourmet magazine, would bring him in hamburgers.  I would stop at the Swedish delicatessen on Second Avenue and bring him sandwiches and Swedish meatballs.  Rudolph Stanish, the omelet king, prepared an omelet at bedside.\n\nQ:  How long was he there?\n\nFerrone:  He must have been there for several weeks.\n\nQ:  Did he ever talk about his food consumption, worried about it, or anything like that?\n\nFerrone:  Oh, he was always dieting and falling off the diet.\n\nQ:  Do you know if he felt ashamed of not being able to stay on a diet, which, of course, is everybody.\n\nFerrone:  He felt guilty about it, yes.  I imagine he would sneak food, I would guess.\n\nQ:  Let’s talk a little bit about the meals at his home that you were part of.  How would something like that happen?  Would it be spontaneous?  Would he invite people?  How would it work?\n\nFerrone:  Well, I was there frequently as the only guest.  It might be an impromptu call the same day or the day before.  In the early days before his companion, Gino Cofacci, I might be the only guest because he was doing a lot of kitchen testing in those days.  He was working on magazine articles, and it was exciting because it was experimental.  I would be learning in the process, and very often he would give me plates of food to carry home, sometimes enough so I could invite a friend to share it with me the next day.\nWhen Gino entered the picture, it was somewhat different.  When he lived on 12th Street, for example, Gino had a third-floor apartment.  I would go over, and Jim would be in the kitchen.  We would start putting dinner together, the two of us.  It was wonderful, easy.  We’d laugh and chat.  And Jim had this way of going about putting together a meal with great ease.  He knew exactly what he was doing.  He’d be whistling or humming.\nWhen he got to this point where the meal was just about ready, he would get on the telephone and call Cofacci on the third floor and say, “We’re ready now.”  Cofacci would enter, and the whole atmosphere would change to one of fussing, anxiety, complaints.\n\nQ:  From whom?\n\nFerrone:  From Cofacci.\n\nQ:  And how did Beard react to that?\n\nFerrone:  Tolerated it.  But the magic was gone.  The fun was gone.\n\nQ:  Of making the meal?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  The list that you gave me had such amazing details of so many of the meals.  I wondered if you’d kept notes, or how you kept a record of that?\n\nFerrone:  It was not intentional.  It came from various sources.  I did keep little datebooks at that point.  I may have just jotted down a particular meal.  But I don’t know what other sources I had.  This probably would be my only source.\n\nQ:  That’s amazing.  I guess you kept all your datebooks.\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  In the article that you gave me with the trip in the south of France, it seemed as though he might have been writing letters to you before you got over there?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Is that correct?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So the information about the food might have come from those letters?  In other words, the information about the meals where you were not present.\n\nFerrone:  Some of it may have come from letters he wrote to Helen Evans Brown, in which he talked about what he was planning to cook or what he had cooked, for himself or for me.\n\nQ:  How much was food a subject of his conversation?\n\nFerrone:  He was always interested in what you just ate or were about to eat.  If you were to ask me what food people talked about, I would say food.  They’re always chatting about food, but Beard was interested in everything, as I said.\n\nQ:  Did you ever do other things with him, go places with him, you know, to the theater or opera or anything like that?\n\nFerrone:  I’ve been to the opera with him.\n\nQ:  Did he enjoy opera?\n\nFerrone:  Oh, he was a great opera fan.\n\nQ:  Because of his early interest in it?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  Well, he studied voice.  I spent three vacations with him, I may have told you.\n\nQ:  No.\n\nFerrone:  Twice with him in Plascassier in Julia Child’s house, and once in Gearhart, in Oregon seaside, where he used to go in summers as a boy with his family.  He was staying in a friend’s house, Harvey Welsh’s house, and I was there with him and his childhood friend, Mary Hamblett.  I remember going clamming, razor clamming, with a little shovel, bringing back the clams, which Jim cooked for us for our lunch.  And I visited him in San Francisco when he held cooking classes at Stanford Court Hotel.\n\nQ:  When you went on vacations with him, did he ever bring along any of his companions?\n\nFerrone:  No.  Well, on two of these occasions I was working on a book with him.  In St. Remy, for example, we were finishing up Delights and Prejudices, and at Plascassier we were working on American Cookery.  We worked on American Cookery for almost four years.  I thought it would never end.\n\nQ:  Why did it take that long?\n\nFerrone:  It’s a huge book.  It was intended to be comprehensive.  He had a lot to say.  He’d done a tremendous amount of research.  Even then, there are holes in it.  We just finally couldn’t go on any longer.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  What kinds of holes?\n\nFerrone:  It seems to me that we couldn’t get it [unclear] the chapter on preserving and canning.  I’d have to go look at it again.\n\nQ:  Actually, let us go over the books that you did edit.  Soups, is that correct?\n\nFerrone:  No.\n\nQ:  No?  Because I read that you edited Soups.\n\nFerrone:  I did a little series for Thames and Hudson, Soups, Salads, Shellfish, and Poultry.  That was posthumous.\n\nQ:  All of them?\n\nFerrone:  Those four, yes.\n\nQ:  So the ones that you worked on with him when he was alive were?\n\nFerrone:  Starting off with James Beard Cookbook, Delights and Prejudices, Menus for Entertaining, Beard on Bread.\n\nQ:  And then on your own afterward you did The Armchair James Beard?\n\nFerrone:  I did the book of letters, Love and Kisses and a Halo of Truffles and The Armchair James Beard.\n\nQ:  So when you were working with him on either the Cookbook or Delights and Prejudices, was there a standard pattern of behavior?  How did that work?  Would he present you with more onionskin?\n\nFerrone:  No.  For the earlier books, he would type out the material, but for the later ones, for, say, Beard on Bread and the books beyond that, he would tape the material, and his secretary would transcribe it and we’d get the rough draft.\n\nQ:  Why did he tape it, do you think?\n\nFerrone:  His fingers wouldn’t fit on the typewriter keys any longer.\n\nQ:  I see.  That’s a good reason.  And in terms of the writing procedure on the many, many articles that you did with him over the years, how did that work?  He would give you—\n\nFerrone:  Again, it would probably be taped and then transcribed, where the earlier ones would have been typed up by him.\n\nQ:  So when were the years where you would have done that at night, rather than on your day job?\n\nFerrone:  I would say during the sixties and seventies.\n\nQ:  Did you have an arrangement, an unspoken arrangement?  Did he pay you?  Did you do it as a favor?\n\nFerrone:  It was handled through his agent.\n\nQ:  Aha.  So it was treated in a professional manner.\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  And when you would finish an article, would it go back to him?  Would it go straight to House and Garden?  How would that work?\n\nFerrone:  It would go back to him.\n\nQ:  Did you mind not getting more credit for it at that point?\n\nFerrone:  No.\n\nQ:  Tell me about that.\n\nFerrone:  I didn’t feel the need for credit somehow.  I felt bad for him in a way.  I’m sorry that he couldn’t complete the process himself.  He did well by me, after all.  \n\nQ:  No?  Did he also leave you physically any of his material?\n\nFerrone:  No.  I acquired some things from the estate that were auctioned off.  That Chinese painting, “The Ancestors,” was Jim’s, for example.\n\nQ:  And you purchased that from the estate?\n\nFerrone:  Yes, at the auction.  He was great on giving me castoff kitchen things, and in the early days, too, he used to travel by ship to Europe, and he would buy enormous quantities of dishes.  He would bring back a barrel full.  He’d give me nine wonderful dishes from France.\nOne time he was having his shirts custom-made in Barcelona.  He noted that one of the workmen had a wonderful striped apron.  It was more than an apron; it was more like a smock.  He had one made for me and one made for Craig Claiborne.\n\nQ:  Do you still have it?\n\nFerrone:  I never wore it.  I don’t think I ever saw on occasion to use it.  I think I gave it away.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nFerrone:  Jim was very generous to begin with, which seems at odds with his reputation for being very tight, especially when going to restaurants with friends and not footing the bill.\n\nQ:  Did that always happen?\n\nFerrone:  Well, I used to eat out a lot with him in restaurants, but usually it was on the house.\n\nQ:  So how did that reputation get going for not picking up the tab?\n\nFerrone:  Well, it occurs in his biographies.  I wasn’t aware of it myself.  He was always afraid of going broke.\n\nQ:  Why do you think that was?\n\nFerrone:  Well, he was freelancing.  He was scrambling. He had a rather elaborate lifestyle.  He entertained lavishly, traveled, and he had to really hustle to bring it all together.\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nFerrone:  He had to have so many sources of income, and he was writing cookbooks and writing articles and doing food demonstrations across the country, appearing on television, acting as a consultant to restaurants, acting as consultant to Green Giant, doing demonstrations for the Cognac people.\n\nQ:  I know it’s a different time now, but was any of that frowned upon?\n\nFerrone:  Well, he was always criticized for being tight and anti-commercial, but I never saw that it affected his writing.  I mean, he could do consulting for Green Giant, for example, but that didn’t mean that he was going to push Green Giant products in his cookbooks.\n\nQ:  He was criticized because at that time nobody was doing it?\n\nFerrone:  Nobody was doing it and certainly not to his extent to which he was doing it.  He had his fingers in an awful lot of pies.\n\nQ:  Why do you think he was so anxious about going broke?\n\nFerrone:  Well, I could understand that if you don’t have a full-time job.\n\nQ:  Did he ever talk about his mother and how his mother managed to support herself or if that was difficult?\n\nFerrone:  Well, he wrote about it extensively in Delights and Prejudices.\n\nQ:  But as conversation?\n\nFerrone:  He didn’t talk much about his mother.\n\nQ:  Do you think that you learned anything from him about food, and I don’t mean recipes.  I mean starting with good product, that kind of thing?\n\nFerrone:  I learned everything from him about it, how to cook honestly, simply, with attention to the freshness of the food.  He gave me a sense of the joy of cooking seasonally.  We used to have an asparagus festival every spring.\n\nQ:  What was that like?\n\nFerrone:  Either he would do it or I would do it.  We’d have the first asparagus on the market and shad roe.  And he also taught me the importance of food presentation, a sensuous approach to food, rather than just a clinical approach.\n\nQ:  How was that communicated to you?  I mean the importance of food presentation.\n\nFerrone:  I imitated him.  He was not one for serving sets of dishes.\n\nQ:  You mean to have all the food come on the same kind of plate?\n\nFerrone:  Yes, a parade of a dinner service.  He collected wonderful Majolica and all sorts of other dinnerware, antiques often, and he would choose the dish to suit the food.  And so it wasn’t boring.  It was exciting.  I think we all imitated him whether we were going out for a meal [unclear].  H was a pacesetter.\n\nQ:  Tell me what you mean.\n\nFerrone:  He was always on the lookout for new foods, and he’d go traveling, and he’d bring back a new dish and it would become his new signature dish for the season.  We’d all copy it.\n\nQ:  He seems to have had tumultuous personal relationships with all different kinds of people, professional people, friends.  But your relationship didn’t seem to have that.\n\nFerrone:  No.  The only time he got mad at me was when we were doing a new edition of his book Fowl and Gamebird Cookery.  I think the original was Fowl and Game, and we changed it to Fowl and Gamebird.  I didn’t want a conventional food cover.  I wanted a picture of Jim on the cover with birds, and the artist couldn’t quite get Jim right.  Jim was on the West Coast, and finally the artist came up with a cover which seemed acceptable.  But I couldn’t get in touch with Jim, and we were down to a deadline.  We finally had to go into production.  And Jim hated that cover so much because it had a pheasant flying behind his head, but it looked as though he was wearing a feathered hat.  And he got furious with me over that jacket.  That’s the only time I remember him being angry with me.  But I don’t recall his having tumultuous relationships with other people in the food world.\n\nQ:  No, I wasn’t really thinking of the food world.  Well, he just seemed to—maybe “tumultuous” is not quite the right word.  There were moments of intense emotion in one way or another.\n\nFerrone:  Can you think of somebody you have in mind?\n\nQ:  Well, I guess I was thinking more of personal relationships, rather.  I mean, you would never—or perhaps you would—have described him as a person of extremely even temperament, would you?\n\nFerrone:  He had a temper, certainly, which I’ve only seen operating once or twice.\n\nQ:  The other day—and we’ve talked about it tangentially today—you talked about him and the performance of food, meal as a performance.  I wondered if you could amplify on that a little bit.\n\nFerrone:  Well, you know, several people have said that he was a poor television performer and was self-conscious in front of the camera.  That may have been true, but I think of all the enormous numbers of food demonstrations he did across the country for his cooking school and on behalf of Cognac industry.  He, I think, was quite at ease in front of a smaller live audience.  With the Cognac performance, there were always flames, of course, so it was very theatrical.\n\nQ:  Did that extend into meals at his house?\n\nFerrone:  Well, I don’t recall flaming at his house.  He used to have his cocktail buffets with a great crush of people, but he never had these tiny, precious canapés, which he called doots. He had a spectacular roast of beef with someone to carve it, and French bread.  He would have Polish sausages poached in red wine and sliced.  At one point, he was serving baby quail.  But the food was—“generous” is a weak word for it.\n\nQ:  Let me ask you about the books that he either worked on with other people or that other people more or less wrote most of them.  How did that happen?\n\nFerrone:  Well, I think I was succeeded by José Wilson, who used to be food editor at House and Garden.  She also did a syndicated column with him.  And then José committed suicide, and then he worked briefly with Irene Sax.\n\nQ:  But she told me that she did write one book for him.\n\nFerrone:  She wrote it for him?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFerrone:  I wasn’t aware that he ever—sure, he dictated the material.\n\nQ:  I’ll find out and let you know.\n\nFerrone:  Because that would have been his style at that point, talking into a machine.  It would have been the New James Beard maybe?  The New James Beard was a compilation of all the recipes he really wanted to preserve.  Or was it Beard on Pasta?  I don’t know.  It’s possible it was Beard on Pasta.\n\nQ:  Why did you actually stop working with him on books?  I mean, you seem to have continued on articles.  When you say that you were succeeded by José Wilson, what stopped?  I mean, why was she necessary?  Why did you stop?\n\nFerrone:  Well, Beard just switched allegiances, I guess.\n\nQ:  In terms of the books?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Do you have any idea why?\n\nFerrone:  I can’t think why.\n\nQ:  With any discussion with you or—\n\nFerrone:  I don’t recall a discussion.  Jim wouldn’t have discussed anything like this.  I’m just trying to think whether I had too much work to do and couldn’t handle it anymore.  I really can’t remember.  Or it may have been that José lost her job at House and Garden and—\n\nQ:  During the time, which is decades, that you were working with him, were you continuing to work as an editor on all the things that you’ve previously edited, literary things?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So what kinds of day jobs were you engaged in at that point?  What kinds of authors?\n\nFerrone:  Well, apart from those major authors that I listed?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFerrone:  It’s hard to remember, there was so much.  I was editor for a book by Janet Flanner, for example, called Janet Flanner’s World.  She was then somewhat senile.  I went to visit her.\n\nQ:  And she lived in Paris?\n\nFerrone:  She lived in New York.  And I went to her eighty-fifth birthday party, which was quite an event, with people like Virgil Thompson and Glenway Wescott and Ned Rorem in attendance.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nFerrone:  We gave a big party for the book at the St. Regis, and I was editing C.S. Lewis’ books, in conjunction with his executor in England.\n\nQ:  Was Beard interested in that side of your work at all?\n\nFerrone:  Just trying to think whether—I don’t think he would have been interested in Virginia Woolf or Anais Nin or Alice Walker, but he read a lot, certainly.\n\nQ:  Do you know what kinds of things?\n\nFerrone:  I don’t know.  Whatever was current, I would say.\n\nQ:  I’m going to turn this off.\n\n[End of interview] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFerrone– 1 -  PAGE 40\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  John Ferrone\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #2\n\nInterviewer:   Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t           New York City\n\nDate:  March 5, 2009\n\n\nQ:  I’m with John Ferrone in his home in Greenwich Village, and this is our second interview.  Good afternoon.\n\nFerrone:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  You know, one of the things that we didn’t speak about the other day was the circle of people around James Beard, and I assume that you knew most of them, at least the ones that were regular participants in his life.\n\nFerrone:  Well, I would encounter them at his cocktail parties.\n\nQ:  You would encounter them at his cocktail parties?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  Of the people surrounding him, I probably knew best Helen McCully, who was then food editor of McCall’s, and Cecily Brownstone, who was food editor for Associated Press, and there was Alvin Kerr, who worked for Gourmet.  There were the Aarons.\n\nQ:  What was her name?\n\nFerrone:  Florence and Sam Aaron.  Then there was Jack Aaron.  Jack didn’t come to these parties.  It was Sam and Florence.\n\nQ:  Jack was a son?\n\nFerrone:  No, Jack was a brother who ran Sherry Wine and Spirits, as it was then called.\n\nQ:  And when you say you would encounter them, that means at dinner parties?\n\nFerrone:  Dinner parties and cocktail buffets, both.\n\nQ:  Which did James prefer?\n\nFerrone:  Oh, he liked his buffets.  It was a great roundup.  It would be quite a number of people, although I have been to dinner parties at his place when he had eighteen people as guests.\n\nQ:  How did that work?\n\nFerrone:  Very well, amazingly enough.  I think I wrote about one early dinner that I recall when he was still at 36 West 12th Street with a very limited kitchen, notoriously limited.  He had a cranky little gas stove, no kitchen sink.  The kitchen sort of intertwined with the bathroom along a kind of hallway, and he had to do dishes in the bathroom sink, but he preferred to do dishes sometimes in the bathtub.  He said he would wash the dishes in the sink, or at least soap them in the sink, put them in the bathtub, pull the shower curtain closed, and turn on the shower.  This, of course, was when he had enormous dinner parties and there were a lot of crockery to be cleaned.\n\nQ:  Did it work?\n\nFerrone:  It worked, and sometimes the bathtub was used as a giant cooler for champagne.\nAnyway, there was one party which he served a lobster dish en croute, which was pretty ambitious for eighteen people, and Craig Claiborne was at that party, I remember, because he helped with the puff paste.  But there were other dinner parties of that magnitude.\n\nQ:  How did he do the seating?  Was it casual, or did he think it through?\n\nFerrone:  Well, eighteen people couldn’t have sat down very easily in the studio apartment he had.\n\nQ:  Oh, of course.\n\nFerrone:  It was a largish room, but even so, you couldn’t seat eighteen people.  I suppose we carried a plate around with us.\n\nQ:  There wasn’t like a sideboard or—\n\nFerrone:  There was no sideboard.  He had a rather large marble-top table, his dining table, I suspect.  That was where the food was arrayed.  I talked about his cocktail buffets in which he liked to have rather substantial kinds of food rather than bits and pieces.\n\nQ:  Was there ever anything in the way of help?\n\nFerrone:  Oh, he had help, yes.  There was always his houseman, Clay Triplette, who’s still with the James Beard Foundation.  He hired Clay, I think, in 1959, and Clay was with him until he died, and he’s still there as a kind of representation of the good old days.\n\nQ:  What did he actually do for Beard?\n\nFerrone:  Well, he was called a housekeeper on occasion.  Whether he did physical cleaning or not, I have no idea, but he was a good cook in his own right, and he probably did preliminary preparation for various meals and for the parties, certainly.\n\nQ:  So might he have carried around plates, or who would have done that?\n\nFerrone:  Beard would hire extra help for these parties.\n\nQ:  And the silver and plates would be laid out somewhere?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  Well, in two places, two apartments, he had his working space for his classes, and he had what he called his grand piano, which was a rather horseshoe-shaped array of stoves, stovetops, all electric.  I don’t recall—at least in the first kitchen on 10th Street, his interior designer, Agnes White, had made for him panels to cover the stove for buffet so the food was—\n\nQ:  In the first apartment?\n\nFerrone:  In the first apartment.  The food was arrayed all around this horseshoe-shaped stove arrangement.\n\nQ:  Some of them still in the pots they were cooked in or on platters, or how did that work?\n\nFerrone:  I don’t recall specifically how it was served.  I said that he would have an enormous roast beef prepared for him by Leon Leonides of the Coach House and he’d have somebody there to slice it, carve it, and serve it on French bread.  But he’d have at least two or three or four people serving on those occasions.\n\nQ:  And was it done in an orderly course-by-course style, or no?\n\nFerrone:  No.  No.\n\nQ:  Just everything there?\n\nFerrone:  Everything there.\n\nQ:  So with a large party, could you describe the kinds of things that might have been there?  This big roast beef, would there have been several vegetable dishes or—\n\nFerrone:  There might have been vegetable dishes, crudités.  I think I mentioned the fact that he often had smoked Polish sausages poached in red wine and sliced.  And at one point when he knew someone who had a quail farm, he served bits of quail roasted, grilled.  He served quail eggs.\n\nQ:  That was pretty early for quail eggs, wasn’t it?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  But there were always a few surprise dishes, too, and always a feeling of great bounty.\n\nQ:  What time did they start, more or less?\n\nFerrone:  Probably around six.\n\nQ:  And it would go on—\n\nFerrone:  Go on to eight or nine.  The whole idea behind his style of serving was to provide substantial food for the drinkers so they didn’t have to feel they would need to go on to a dinner afterwards.  They could make a dinner out of whatever was there.\n\nQ:  Were there sweets or desserts after?\n\nFerrone:  There were sweets also.\n\nQ:  On the table at the same time?\n\nFerrone:  I couldn’t remember.\n\nQ:  Was there a kind of organized conversation or people milled around?\n\nFerrone:  No, we just all milled around.  Sometimes it was quite a crush.  People would gravitate to the food, naturally.  When he moved to the place on 12th Street, there were people downstairs and upstairs in a number of rooms.\n\nQ:  Would people be allowed in the kitchen?\n\nFerrone:  Oh yes.  That’s where the food was, and in the latter days, Jim would sit in his director’s chair with people milling about him.  I can remember one occasion when he was probably close to eighty years old, it was a large party, it was a holiday, probably a Christmas party, and he had been dieting.  He was standing up, and someone handed him a Christmas present.  As he reached out to take it, his pants fell down, and everyone, including him, roared.  But he had successfully dieted, apparently.\n\nQ:  If people got an invitation to come to one of these dinners, how was that seen, as a great coup or a measure of friendship or what?\n\nFerrone:  Measure of friendship, largely, because you saw the same old gang each time.  There might have been a few new faces, but we all knew one another.\n\nQ:  Which actually brings me to another kind of questioning.  Do you think he had good taste in people, the people he surrounded himself with, people who were good for him?\n\nFerrone:  Good taste.  Well, some of them were colleagues in the food business.  Some of them went back to his Portland days, like Ron and Isabel Callvert and Peggy Loesser.  And there were sort of business associates, like the Aarons.  It was a sort of a mixed bag.  I don’t think he chose his guest list with any particular slant.  It also included a woman named Sylvia Pedlar, who was a designer of lingerie, so it wasn’t always food-related.\n\nQ:  How did he meet Sylvia?\n\nFerrone:  I have no idea, but she and her husband were certainly present at every party I ever went to, I think.\n\nQ:  Were any of the young men he was involved with present at these dinners?\n\nFerrone:  Well, he wasn’t really involved with anybody until Cofacci came along, and he was certainly present because he lived there.  Although Carl Jerome, who also lived in Beard’s house for a time, he helped Beard in his cooking school.\n\nQ:  From your point of view in watching the different people that he worked with, would you think that any of them were particularly helpful to him?  Were some of them better than others in terms of drawing him out or making him feel relaxed or just about anything?\n\nFerrone:  Well, I think they all did a good job with him.  Isabel Callvert was the first, and she knew him quite well.  She’d known him for a long period of time, so she knew his voice and knew what was expected of him.  José Wilson was probably the most professional of all of us who worked with him.\n\nQ:  You mean in terms of training or what?\n\nFerrone:  Her background, her long association with House and Garden as food editor.  She was a good writer and a strong personality.  She could handle Jim.\n\nQ:  Could you describe the process when you worked with him on books, how that happened?  What came first?  How did it proceed?\n\nFerrone:  Well, as I said earlier, in the beginning days he used to pound out a rough draft of his articles on his portable typewriter, very rough indeed, but containing all the necessary ingredients.  Occasionally, he would just hand me the draft for me to work on.  We didn’t necessarily discuss anything.  I would go to work on it, polish it up, hand it back to him, and then I would hear nothing, assuming that what I had done was satisfactory.  Occasionally he would write to me and tell me what he wanted to get out of the article, what sort of feeling he wanted to project.\n\nQ:  Could you remember enough to describe one of those?\n\nFerrone:  Well, I was thinking of an introduction to a book on cooking utensils that was published by Wolf Glaser Beard, and Jim was writing the introduction for it.  He wanted to start it off by saying that he grew up in the iron age of cooking; in other words, his mother cooked in iron.  So he told me the kind of feeling he wanted to inject in this piece about the early days of cooking.\n\nQ:  Literally the early days of cooking?\n\nFerrone:  I mean early in his own life.  But that was rare.  Occasionally he would do that with a given piece, but normally I would just be handed a rough draft to work on.  I might send it back to him and say that it needed clarification or additional material.  It may have passed between us a couple of times.  But later on he would talk his piece into a tape machine, and then his secretary would transcribe it.\n\nQ:  What about the recipes that went along with those pieces?  Would he have them written down somewhere and incorporate them, or would he actually dictate recipes as well?\n\nFerrone:  He would dictate the recipes as well.\n\nQ:  Interesting.\n\nFerrone:  And, of course, we were kitchen testing all the time too.  Not necessarily because I was asked to, but because I was intrigued enough to kitchen test.\n\nQ:  And when you were kitchen testing, was the idea that the readers of whatever publication would then definitely be able to follow it?  I mean, were the readers’ strengths kept in mind?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  I made sure that the instructions were clear enough for any cook to follow.\n\nQ:  That wasn’t something he was particularly interested in or—\n\nFerrone:  Well, he was, yes, but it was up to me to tell him if it wasn’t clear enough.\n\nQ:  So testing would have been very helpful in that respect?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Of the books that you worked on with him, was any one of them more of a pleasure or more of a chore than any of the others?\n\nFerrone:  Well, American Cookery went on for four years, so that was a chore, though it was exciting at the same time.\n\nQ:  Exciting because?\n\nFerrone:  Because of the nature of the material, all the research he had done on the early cookbook writers.\nMenus for Entertaining was the closest we came to a collaboration.  I think it was my idea to begin with, the concept for the book, and I really outlined it for him.  In other words, I gave him the various chapters, and he filled in the blanks, so to speak.  But I think he enjoyed working on that book, and I did too.  I’m trying to think where we were writing part of that.  We might have started that in France.\nDelights and Prejudices we finished up in the south of France, that is for sure.  That was a pleasure to work on, although, as I said, the actual manuscript on onionskin single-spaced was not a pleasure to work with.\n\nQ:  You started to mention before that this collaboration was not exactly face to face most of the time; it was pieces of paper in between both of you.\n\nFerrone:  Yes. \n\nQ:  How you would describe that pattern?\n\nFerrone:  Beard and I, I don’t think ever sat down to discuss a piece.  I would drop by and pick up the rough draft from his secretary and deliver it the same way.\n\nQ:  Do you know if he’d done any initial testing before that?\n\nFerrone:  Oh, I’m sure he was testing the whole time.\n\nQ:  Why?  I mean, why are you sure?\n\nFerrone:  Because I was there for some of the—\n\nQ:  I see, yes.\n\nFerrone:  —for the experiments, and he would sometimes ask me to test something for him if we were working on a piece.\n\nQ:  What was his attitude toward a new book, generally speaking?  Was it excitement or worried or arduous in the sense that a huge amount of work had to be done?  When there was a new project, how was he likely to react to it?\n\nFerrone:  I don’t know.  I think he approached it in a very workmanlike way.\n\nQ:  Do you think any of them gave him more pleasure than any of the others?\n\nFerrone:  It’d be hard to say.\n\nQ:  I just wondered if it showed.  Along those lines, I know he obviously talked about food, but was he constantly talking about food or what?\n\nFerrone:  We talked about food a lot.  As I said earlier, food people talked about food.  And if I called him on the phone, he always wanted to know what I was going to eat that night for dinner or what I had eaten the night before, or what I was going to serve if I had guests coming.  He was interested to that degree in food, but he was also interested in a great many other things.\n\nQ:  Some of the clips that I’ve read about him said that he had—and I think in the Clark book, too, it describes a good instinct for knowing what the public wanted at a particular time or what might resonate with the public at a particular time.  Does that strike you as accurate?\n\nFerrone:  That doesn’t sound like him at all.  I don’t think he thought in terms of responding to public need.  I think he was the leader.  He set the trends.  I don’t think he thought it out in that way, in a marketing way.  That wasn’t his style and that wasn’t his approach to food.\n\nQ:  You mean doing what was trendy?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  No, I wouldn’t think so.  Did he ever come to your country house?\n\nFerrone:  Yes, two or three times.\n\nQ:  For something special or—\n\nFerrone:  Well, all our calls came certainly at the height of the summer season when the vegetable season, especially when the garden was overflowing.  I have pictures of him lugging a basket loaded with tomatoes and other vegetables.  We had a good time together, very relaxed.  We cooked together.  I have a fairly spacious kitchen in the country.\nOn one occasion, I know I had other guests when he was there, and we did a loin of pork roast stuffed with prunes and a smoked loin of pork roast stuffed with dried apricots.\n\nQ:  Why do you think you remember that?  Was it a lot of people?\n\nFerrone:  There might have been three or four other guests.  I think that was when he’d just stopped by.  He’d been doing a demonstration at Boscov’s department store in Redding.\n\nQ:  To do a demonstration or to sign?\n\nFerrone:  He did a demonstration, and they sold, I think, eight hundred copies of The James Beard Cookbook.\n\nQ:  At Boscov’s?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Was that because his personality was particularly winning or that he gave them confidence about cooking or what?\n\nFerrone:  It was just a well-organized event.\n\nQ:  I see.  That sounds right.  That’s very funny.\n\nFerrone:  He did these cooking demonstrations all across the country for a good deal of time with his helper, Ruth Norman.  He was a busy man.  He traveled a good deal for food demonstrations associated with the cooking school, but then he also did demonstrations for the Cognac industry, in which he flamed an awful lot of food.  I can’t think of another food authority who was active in so many ways, cooking schools, the cross-country demonstrations, consultant to restaurants and to the food industry, television appearances, and cookbook writing.  He was a very busy man.\n\nQ:  Do you know if he had favorite restaurants in New York or the Village?\n\nFerrone:  Oh, he did.  Uptown he liked QuoVadis a lot.  I don’t think it exists any longer.\n\nQ:  He liked the food or the atmosphere?\n\nFerrone:  Both, and the reception.  Here in the Village he liked the Coach House, where he knew Leon Leonides very well and was given a great welcome.  I can remember going there with him for Christmas Eve or Christmas dinner on several occasions.\n\nQ:  Any smaller places that he liked?\n\nFerrone:  Well, he used to like that Italian restaurant called Grand Ticino, which he tried to buy at one point.\n\nQ:  Why?\n\nFerrone:  He wanted a restaurant of his own.  The deal was almost all set, and then the owner backed out at the last minute, and he was terribly disappointed.  Then he went on the hunt for a restaurant all over the place.  He went to Maryland.  He was constantly after Helen Evans Brown to go into the restaurant business with him, and nothing ever came of it.\n\nQ:  Why do you think he wanted to do that?  Surely he knew how difficult and expensive running a restaurant was.\n\nFerrone:  Well, he might have seen it as a challenge, but he was just drawn to it.  He managed a restaurant on Nantucket one summer, it was in 1953, which may have provided the spark.\n\nQ:  Let me ask you about the homosexuality issue in terms of—let’s just say things were very different then, and sexual preference simply wasn’t mentioned, and people weren’t as comfortable being out in the open with what they were as certainly they are now.  What was his attitude about that, as far as you could tell?\n\nFerrone:  Well, we really didn’t talk about it.  Just taken for granted.  I think he was lonely a good deal of the time.  But in his earlier days, I think he took some risks.\n\nQ:  So also those opera desires didn’t go away either.  That’s very funny.  I guess you just said in the early days he took some risks in terms of who he was associating with.  Did he just give that up?\n\nFerrone:  He gave it up.  I think he must have come to his senses.  And then Cofacci arrived on the scene.  He was a much younger man, a would-be architect who went into the food business, became a professional baker, provided dacquoise and chocolate cakes to a couple of restaurants.\n\nQ:  Was Beard happier at that time?\n\nFerrone:  Well, maybe initially, but Cofacci became a burden.  He was just a childish, self-centered person.\n\nQ:  Did his friends comment about that to him?\n\nFerrone:  Well, it was very touchy.  I mean, his friends knew that Beard was having difficulty with Cofacci, but didn’t dare comment on it directly.\n\nQ:  Why not?\n\nFerrone:  Because Beard was, at the same time, very protective.  You know how that can be.  He could criticize Cofacci, but no one else could.  He was very protective.  I used to get annoyed with Jim, because I would invite them here for dinner, and Jim would go home, and an hour later the phone would ring, and Jim would say, “Well, Mr. Cofacci had a good time,” when all I cared about was whether Mr. Beard had had a good time.\n\nQ:  Yes, exactly.  [laughs]  What would you say?\n\nFerrone:  Well, I made the proper noises.\n\nQ:  Was it at all daunting to cook for him?\n\nFerrone:  Oh, initially, but afterwards, it was fun.  He was very easy to be with and very appreciative of anyone who cooked for him.  I can show you my kitchen and show you the space the two of us operated in.\n\nQ:  Good.  I’ll take a look afterward.  Actually, when I was asking you about the restaurants, I forgot to ask you, did the owners comp most of the meals?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Was that done in those days?\n\nFerrone:  It was done in those days, and I think Beard expected it.\n\nQ:  And they didn’t seem to mind?\n\nFerrone:  No.  They were eager to have him there as a showpiece.  I went with him countless times to restaurants where he was comped.\n\nQ:  The wine, everything?\n\nFerrone:  Wine, everything.\n\nQ:  And what would he do about tipping?\n\nFerrone:  Leave a good tip.\n\nQ:  In that circumstance, yes.  You’ve described the way you worked together.  It would be different when he was alone in a kitchen with somebody, but when people were helping him with books, do you think that that process remained the same in terms of him giving some ideas and somebody else putting it into shape than back and forth?\n\nFerrone:  I would think so.  I have no idea how he worked with José and Irene Sax, but I think he would have operated quite the same way.\n\nQ:  You think that was because he could concentrate better by himself, or what?\n\nFerrone:  It was easier just to talk the article into a machine.  Later on, in his very latest years, we were all trying to get another book out of him, essays on particular foods.  We all took turns trying to extract material from him.  I tried; Judith Jones tried; I think Irene tried.  We didn’t get very far, but he talked about his love of potatoes, for example.  There are tapes in existence.  I think Barbara Kafka was involved, too, and I think that she used some of the material that he finally came up with, but he was just beyond the point when he could really produce anything more.\n\nQ:  This is a big question, but I’m wondering if you could think about how he changed your life, what your life would have been without having met him, either in terms of the things he discussed that you might not have thought about or the people he introduced you to or anything like that.\n\nFerrone:  Well, I think this apartment reflects Beard.\n\nQ:  How so?\n\nFerrone:  Because I started off with three sticks of furniture, and I came from California, where I probably was more inclined to the arts and crafts style of furnishing, and I think it was Beard’s love of antiques that got me started on antiquing and collecting Japanese and Chinese porcelain.  And then of course his influence in terms of food and entertaining was tremendous.  I’d say he’s one of the two or three great influences in my life.\n\nQ:  Could you talk a little bit about the apartment?  Would he go to antique stores with you?  Would he suggest certain purchases?  Was he careful of your feelings?\n\nFerrone:  We gave each other antiques for Christmas.  I can remember antiquing with him in San Francisco, and we would spot things.  I remember in San Francisco, I spotted an enormous tea caddy, old tea caddy, with my initial on it, for Formosa tea, I think it was, and Jim said, “I’ll give it to you for Christmas.”  So he had it shipped back.\nThen when I was in London one year, I went to an antique store in Chelsea and I saw the roof tile which is behind your head.\n\nQ:  That’s pretty extraordinary.\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  And it was well priced.  When I came back, Jim said, “Did you see anything you liked?”\n\tAnd I said, “Yes, I saw this roof tile at Loot.”\n\tSo he was going over to London, and so he bought it for me and had it shipped back.  So we were constantly looking for presents for each other.\n\nQ:  And as you assembled this apartment and its contents and everything, did he help you at all or just inspire your—\n\nFerrone:  Inspired me, and his interior decorator, Agnes White, was a great help.  He gave me a handsome desk, which is in the other room.  It was really an early nineteenth century pantry table that was converted into a desk, French.  He bought it from Lord & Taylor, I think.  He couldn’t get his knees under it, so it got put in storage, and when I moved here, he donated it to me.  And he always gave me dishes too.\n\nQ:  Why was that?\n\nFerrone:  Well, either he had too many and was disposing of them, things he lost interest in.  I have a couple of wonderful sets of Ironstone, for example.  Or else he went abroad and bought enormous quantities himself and shared them.\n\nQ:  Maybe we could stop for a second and show me the kitchen.\\\n\nQ:  Can you tell me how you found out that he had left you his royalties?\n\nFerrone:  Well, shortly after he died, I had a call from the Beard House.  It was his executor.  I think it was Morrie Galen. Morris Galen, who said that he and a couple of people from the bank who was handling the estate, Manufacturer’s Hanover, I believe it was, wanted to come by to see me.  And about three or four of them trooped in and told me I was the beneficiary, and I was just stunned.  I thought Beard might have left me royalties for one book that we had done together, American Cookery, but it was an enormous surprise.\n\nQ:  And what about his library?  What happened to that?\n\nFerrone:  It was sold at auction.  It went to—Doyle, is that right?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFerrone:  Doyle handled the estate sale.\n\nQ:  Did his friends try to buy any of the books?  I mean, I realize they must have tried to buy some of the physical things as well.\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  The sale went on for one night and the next day.  I think the library sale took place in the evening.  I didn’t attend, so I didn’t witness it.\n\nQ:  You didn’t attend either one of them?\n\nFerrone:  I attended the one the next day and bought that Chinese hanging portrait behind the sofa, and I bought some Majolica.\n\nQ:  Because you admired them, because you wanted to have something of his taste, or what?\n\nFerrone:  I thought it was very handsome.\n\nQ:  Yes, they’re pretty great.\n\nFerrone:  It was given to him by his childhood friend, Mary Hamblett.  I offered to send it back to her, but she declined to have it.\n\nQ:  Since we’re at this dining room table, when he would come here to have dinner with you, how would that work?  Where would he be?  Would he sit at the head of the table or it didn’t matter?\n\nFerrone:  He probably would sit there.\n\nQ:  At the head of the table.\n\nFerrone:  At the head of the table.  I would sit there, closest to the kitchen.  This table might have been smaller.  If I took the leaves out, it might have been more intimate.  And Cofacci would probably be with him, and my friend Johan would be here, probably.  On one occasion, New Year’s Day dinner, I had him and Helen McCully to dinner.  I also had José Wilson here with him.\n\nQ:  Did he like to be surrounded by his friends?\n\nFerrone:  Oh yes.  I couldn’t think of a more convivial person.\n\nQ:  In a situation like this, would he have dominated the conversation, or what?\n\nFerrone:  [unclear] intimate, four people.\n\nQ:  Four or six, yes.\n\nFerrone:  Probably he would have dominated.\n\nQ:  And was there any particular angle toward his conversation?  Would it be cultural, political, or—\n\nFerrone:  No, I couldn’t categorize it in any way.\n\nQ:  Let me ask you how you felt in the weeks leading up to his death, when people knew he was so ill and then when he died.\n\nFerrone:  I went to visit him in the hospital.  He was—well, it was very distressing.  He was in such discomfort, and we knew he was going.  I had to go off to the West Coast, I think, for a sales conference, and I think by the time I got back, he had died.  There was a small loyal group around him at the last.\n\nQ:  Who would that have been?\n\nFerrone:  Barbara Kafka.  Now, who was the restaurateur of that American place?  Larry Forgione.  Caroline Stuart, and Gino, I think.\n\nQ:  And when you describe that small group, you mean who might have gotten together after his—no?\n\nFerrone:  No, just the people who appeared at the hospital.\n\nQ:  Which hospital was it?\n\nFerrone:  New York Hospital.  What is it called?  Up at 65th and—\n\nQ:  You said he was gone by the time you got back, but did anybody do anything?\n\nFerrone:  He left instructions he didn’t want any memorial service, he didn’t want anything to go on to memorialize him.  So, nothing.  Nothing happened.  There was no gathering.\n\nQ:  How did that feel?\n\nFerrone:  Well, frustrating in a way.  There’s no way of expressing sorrow.  And there was no one to express it to, no family.\n\nQ:  And did the Thames and Hudson books come after that, after his death?\n\nFerrone:  Oh yes.\n\nQ:  So he continued to play a part—why don’t you describe the way he and his books continued to play a part in your life after his death.\n\nFerrone:  Well, he once said to me that I would know what to do with them, so it was my job as keeper of the flame to, one, keep them in print, keep them updated where necessary, and to create new material if possible.  I know I did the collection of letters to Helen Evans Brown and The Armchair James Beard.\n\nQ:  The Halo of Truffles, is that what you meant?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  You did that with that in mind?\n\nFerrone:  With what in mind?\n\nQ:  Creating new material.\n\nFerrone:  Well, it fell into my lap.  I didn’t know that these letters existed or were accessible, but once I saw what I had, I realized that they needed to be shared.\n\nQ:  So he continued really to play a role in your life?\n\nFerrone:  And still does.\n\nQ:  How would you describe that?\n\nFerrone:  I work with a literary agent in trying to keep the books in print.  And not too long ago, I discovered that the first part of the taped interview with him that I mentioned to you, and told Susan Ungaro at the Beard Foundation about it, and she was intrigued.  They transcribed it and put it on their website, the Beard Foundation website, and also printed a portion of it in one of their bulletins.\n\nQ:  Do you think there’s still stuff left to find?\n\nFerrone:  Possibly.  Halo of Truffles consisted of Jim’s letters to Helen Evans Brown.  I think I may have said that it took me two years to date the letters, because they were all undated.  Eventually, I decided to tackle Helen Evans Brown’s letters as well, with the help of her husband, Phil Brown.\nOnce I had those dated, I realized what a tremendous thing it would be to have the conversation back and forth, and I turned it into a reading, adapted the material, took it to the only producer that I knew in New York, Arthur Kantor.  He was interested immediately.  We talked of trying to do a dry run at some restaurant, possibly with two professional actors, just to test the waters.  We couldn’t seem to get things put together.\nArthur died, and I’ve been peddling that reading ever since.  That was about a dozen years ago.  It’s most recently in the hands of a woman I used to work with, who was the vice president of United Artists and who lives in California.  She’s been trying to produce it.  But it exists, and it’s one thing I would like to see happen before I go to my maker.\n\nQ:  I think we can stop now.  Thank you so much, John.  This has really been wonderful.\n\nFerrone:  Thank you, Judy, for listening.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFerrone – 2 -  PAGE 18\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  John Ferrone\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    Session #3\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t        New York City\n\nDate:  April 1, 2009\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is April 1, 2009 and I’m sitting with John Ferrone in his apartment in Greenwich Village.\nGood afternoon, John.\n\nFerrone:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  I thought we might start today by talking about the people who came to dinner and what the dinner parties were like at the Beard house, I mean at James’s apartment, as opposed to the Beard House.  You went to many dinners at his home, yes?\n\nFerrone:  Yes, many dinner and many cocktail buffets, which was his favorite way of entertaining.\n\nQ:  Why?\n\nFerrone:  Well, he could fit more people into his apartment, into his house, and they were, I’d say, semiannual.\n\nQ:  Celebratory or what?\n\nFerrone:  Maybe connected with the holidays.  And he would have thirty or forty people at a time for the buffets.\n\nQ:  Could you describe one?  Where would the food be laid out?\n\nFerrone:  I’m thinking of the Beard house on 12th Street.  He had, for his cooking classes, a horseshoe-shaped arrangement of cooking tops, stovetops, and he would use this horseshoe—\n\nQ:  You mean he would be in the center of it?\n\nFerrone:  Well, in the center of it or just outside it, but the food would be laid out on the horseshoe surface, and he had servers usually inside the horseshoe.\n\nQ:  Servers passing the food?\n\nFerrone:  Carving the food where necessary, as well as passing it.\n\nQ:  What kind of things might have been carved?\n\nFerrone:  Well, he always had a beautiful roast beef that the Coach House would do for him.\n\nQ:  Would cook for him, actually?\n\nFerrone:  Would actually cook for him.\n\nQ:  Oh, that’s pretty cool.\n\nFerrone:  And he’d have someone carving it to be served on French bread in small slices, and he generally always had smoked Polish sausage, which his houseman, Clay Triplette, would get for him over on Second Avenue, and that would be served in chunks.\n\nQ:  You also talked the other day about the sausage poached in wine, is that correct?\n\nFerrone:  Yes, they poached it.\n\nQ:  The same sausage.\n\nFerrone:  Poached in red wine.\n\nQ:  And how would that be served, also in chunks?\n\nFerrone:  Cut in pieces, yes.  And there was a time when he knew someone who had a quail farm, and small bits of quail would be served, as small enough as it was.\n\nQ:  What do you mean, small bits?\n\nFerrone:  A leg—\n\nQ:  Oh, I see what you mean, I see.  Yes.  As an appetizer?\n\nFerrone:  I’m trying to think how it can be managed standing up, but he did serve it.  And he had served quail eggs, too, hard-boiled quail eggs.\n\nQ:  Oh, now that was early, wasn’t it, for quail eggs?  Early in America.\n\nFerrone:  Early in America.  I’m just trying to think when it might have been.  In the seventies, I would guess.  He hated precious food for cocktails, which he called doots, little bits and pieces, little canapés.\n\nQ:  Doots?  How would you spell doots?\n\nFerrone:  D-o-o-t.  It was a made-up word anyway.  You can spell it any way you want.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFerrone:  So he liked substantial food, and he also liked substantial food so that people wouldn’t fall on their faces after too many drinks.\n\nQ:  That’s a good reason.  [laughs]  Was this meant to take the place of a meal?\n\nFerrone:  In effect, yes, so people wouldn’t have to go out hungry in search for dinner after the cocktail buffet.  You could sustain yourself just from eating what he provided.\n\nQ:  There would be wine, wine and liquor?\n\nFerrone:  Both.\n\nQ:  Could you describe the cast of characters, both generally and specifically, at some of these gatherings?  First, I guess, the kinds of people.\n\nFerrone:  Heterogeneous, I would say, ranging from the food establishment to people like the Pedlars.  Sylvia Pedlar was a designer of lingerie, and her husband, I think, was in advertising.\n\nQ:  Personal friends?\n\nFerrone:  Personal friends.  I have no idea how they connected originally.  There would be personal friends dating from his Portland days, like Isabel Callvert and her husband, Ron.\n\nQ:  Were they living here?\n\nFerrone:  Living here in Manhattan.  Peggy Loesser, who was a children’s book editor who also dated from Jim’s days in Portland.  And in the food establishment, there would be people like Helen McCully, who was food editor of McCall’s and then of House Beautiful, and Alvin Kerr, who was working for Gourmet.  And Clementine Paddleford was known to show up, and Irma Rhode, the woman that Jim started Hors d’Oeuvre Inc., Irma and her brother Bill, that is.  Craig Claiborne occasionally.\n\nQ:  Were these considered events not to be missed?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  There was always a very festive atmosphere at Jim’s, a feeling of great bounty and elegance and conviviality.  I know that going to Jim’s for dinner, it was always for me a kind of everlasting Christmas.\n\nQ:  Let’s talk about the dinners, then.  What would a typical dinner be like?  How many people might there be?\n\nFerrone:  Oh, it could range from me alone to eighteen, which I remember one dinner—\n\nQ:  Why were there eighteen that time?  Was someone in town?\n\nFerrone:  If I remember, it was a very early dinner when he was still living on 12th Street, at 36 West 12th Street, living in a studio apartment with very inadequate kitchen, and he served lobster en croute.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nFerrone:  I know that Craig helped prepare the puff paste.  But there were eighteen guests for that party, and it was champagne and lobster and—\n\nQ:  Wow.  Was there an occasion of any particular kind?\n\nFerrone:  I can’t recall.  I don’t think it was any particular occasion.\n\nQ:  Maybe just celebrating getting that many people into a studio apartment.  [laughter]  The dinners that you were there for, just you personally, would there be a couple of courses or what?\n\nFerrone:  There’d be two or three courses.  Very often Jim was kitchen-testing recipes, and I’d be the guinea pig, or there’d be three or four people, close friends.\n\nQ:  So he would have a first course and a second course?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  What kinds of things?\n\nFerrone:  It’s difficult to remember specifically.\n\nQ:  Well, I meant like soups or always appetizers or—\n\nFerrone:  Seldom soup.  Could be.  Nothing comes to mind specifically.\n\nQ:  But there would be some kind of first course and then—\n\nFerrone:  There would be a first course and a main course and a dessert.  And in the later days, often his companion, Gino Cofacci, who had become a baker, would provide the dessert.  But Jim, as I say, was always kitchen testing, and sometimes he would give me the leftovers to cart home, which was very nice, and sometimes there was enough so I could summon friends to join in.\n\nQ:  That’s very nice.\n\nFerrone:  And eventually I had to cook for Jim.  After I first met him, I was eating at his apartment down the street twice a week, three times a week.  It became embarrassing.  I felt I had to reciprocate in some way, but I found it daunting.\n\nQ:  So how did you get the courage to cook?\n\nFerrone:  I finally fell back on a family recipe for lasagna, which I thought might be a novelty for him.  You use tiny, tiny meatballs instead of the usual ground meat, and he found that intriguing.  And I learned that was the key to entertaining him, to come up with at least one surprise in a menu.\n\nQ:  Was that hard?\n\nFerrone:  Eventually I got more adept at it.  For example, for one New Year’s Day dinner, I did a persimmon sorbet which I made up.\n\nQ:  I am very impressed.\n\nFerrone:  I’m not sure that I was the first ever to do it, but I was the first that I knew of, at any rate.  So we cooked a lot for each other back and forth and cooked together, both here in my inadequate kitchen and his house.\n\nQ:  How would that work if you were cooking together?  Would he—\n\nFerrone:  He would direct me.\n\nQ:  Were you prepping or being a sous chef?\n\nFerrone:  Prepping, being the sous chef, in effect.  We had great fun together.\n\nQ:  We talked a little bit about your inviting him to your country house occasionally.  How would you work the meals there?\n\nFerrone:  He was there, I’d say, a total of three times, not that often.  Then only menu that I can recall, I remember going—he was always interested in marketing wherever he went, so we went to the local farmers’ market, and he wanted a Shoofly Pie since we were in Pennsylvania Dutch country, and I said the Shoofly Pies are absolutely terrible.  He said, “Well, let’s give it a try.”  So we went to one bakery and bought a Shoofly Pie, and it was the most delicious one I ever ate, which gave a lie to my pronouncement.\nBut one meal I remember doing with him, I think there were other guests—\n\nQ:  I was wondering if you invited other people when he was there.\n\nFerrone:  There were two or there other people on hand, I remember, and we did a pork loin stuffed with prunes and a smoked pork loin stuffed with apricots.\n\nQ:  Delicious.\n\nFerrone:  And, you know, you had a slice of each, which was fairly inventive, I think.  He came a couple of times during the vegetable-growing season, and we harvested loads of tomatoes and zucchini and green beans.\n\nQ:  Did you can or cook them or what?\n\nFerrone:  I used to can the tomatoes, yes, and I canned peaches from the local orchard, and I canned pears, and I made raspberry jam and concord grape jelly, in my heyday, but now I’m reduced to just canning peaches.\n\nQ:  That’s not bad.  You know, talking about this fresh produce, I have wondered, and I wonder what you think, if growing up in Portland in a very different kind of market than the eastern situations, if that played a role in his appreciation for fresh food.  I don’t know whether you ever talked about that.\n\nFerrone:  Well, he always spoke about the markets in Portland, and I’m sure set the scene for him for the rest of his life.  But wherever I was with him, he always wanted to go marketing.  I would spend some time with him in the south of France, and we went to the markets in St. Remy and Nice and Cannes, and he never lost interest in—\n\nQ:  It’s so much fun going to those European markets.\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  It’s really great.  One more thing about the dinner parties.  Did he have a regular seat in his own place?\n\nFerrone:  In the later days, he sat in a kind of director’s chair outside the famous horseshoe.\n\nQ:  Was it at the head of the table?\n\nFerrone:  No, it was sort of outside looking on, a rather high director’s chair.\n\nQ:  How interesting.  And why was that?  Would he have access to the kitchen and to the—\n\nFerrone:  He was sitting in the kitchen.\n\nQ:  Aha.\n\nFerrone:  Sitting in the kitchen.  Everybody was milling around the food, naturally, and he would be—\n\nQ:  Then they would sit down—\n\nFerrone:  —he would be presiding.  No, this is for the cocktail buffet.\n\nQ:  Oh, well, I meant what about the dinner parties?\n\nFerrone:  It seems to me that he always had round tables.  I’m just trying to think of the 12th Street arrangement.  Certainly in the 12th Street apartment, the 36th West 12th Street apartment, he had a round table, so there was no head of table.  I don’t recall the seating arrangement on 67th West 12th , but I don’t think he made a thing of being at the head table.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we talk some about what it was like to work with him, both with the articles and with the books, what the working method was in terms of—well, first of all, let’s talk about the articles first.  Would you discuss what he was going to do, or did he just present you with some notes, or how did that work?\n\nFerrone:  Well, in the early days, he would just bang out a rough draft on his portable typewriter.\n\nQ:  These would be columns with a theme?\n\nFerrone:  Not columns, articles for Woman’s Day, House and Garden, and assorted other magazines.  He’d bang out the rough copy, not looking back to make a single correction.  There’d just be strikeovers and words run together, and it needed a lot of cleaning up, a bit of rewriting, but the basic material was there.  And in those early days, he was pretty poor, so he worked alone.  It wasn’t until later that he acquired a staff and a secretary, and he began to talk his material into a tape recorder.\n\nQ:  When would that have been?\n\nFerrone:  I would say in the seventies.\n\nQ:  So he banged out these rough drafts, and what would you get?  You’d get the rough draft?\n\nFerrone:  I got the rough draft.  Eventually, his secretary would transcribe his tape material and I would get a much cleaner copy.\n\nQ:  And then what would you do with it?\n\nFerrone:  I would do the same thing, but it was easier.  The worst example I could think of for his banging out rough copy was his memoir, Delights and Prejudices.  His agent, John Shaffner, decided that I might be the person to edit it.  Jim was given a contract with Atheneum, and I was handed a manuscript on single-spaced onionskin.\n\nQ:  For Delights and Prejudices?\n\nFerrone:  For Delights and Prejudices.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nFerrone:  Without any organization whatsoever, and I had to organize it, suggest new chapters.\n\nQ:  How many pages would that have been?\n\nFerrone:  Oh, probably somewhere around two hundred pages.\n\nQ:  With no discernable organization?\n\nFerrone:  None.  [laughs]  I remember looking at the beginning and saying, “Ah, this would make a nice ending,” and then pulling it out and saving it.  But single-spaced onionskin, there was no way to make editorial marks.  It had to be redone completely.  But it worked out all right.\n\nQ:  Did he have any kind of pride of ownership in his words?\n\nFerrone:  No.  He never looked back.  Once it was out of his head and out of his typewriter, he lost interest.  And I think the fact that it wasn’t entirely his own work made him less interested in feeling proud of it.\n\nQ:  But was he embarrassed that it wasn’t entirely his own work?\n\nFerrone:  Who knows?  I don’t know if he was embarrassed or not.  He suffered it.  [laughs]  He realized he needed help.  And, goodness knows, he worked with enough people along the way, beginning with Isabel Callvert.\n\nQ:  Just going back to the working method, so you would organize it, and then you would end up with a final copy, yes?\n\nFerrone:  A final copy, which I would send to him, and I would seldom get back and feedback.\n\nQ:  You would send it to him and then he’d send it on to the magazine or whoever?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  But I seldom got any feedback or, “This is a great job,” or anything as far as—I didn’t expect to hear from him.\n\nQ:  What about “Thank you”? \n\nFerrone:  Probably.\n\nQ:  Let’s talk about the books.  We talked about Delights and Prejudices.  But was that the general working method?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  The James Beard Cookbook was the one book that I did as an in-house editor.  Dell Books was the publisher.  I was working on the Dell Books staff.\n\nQ:  That took a long time, didn’t it?\n\nFerrone:  There he was working with Isabel Callvert, so I was getting much cleaner copy.  It was totally organized.  Isabel saw to it that it was in great shape.\n\nQ:  Did you go over any kind of outline before he started or during the process?\n\nFerrone:  I don’t remember.  I don’t think that there was much discussion about it, but it was very successful.\n\nQ:  How long did it take, that book?\n\nFerrone:  It was published in 1959, and it seems to me we then began discussions about it, I’d say, 1956.  I’d known Beard about a year.  No, I’d say longer than that.  I’d known him several years, and I think I told my boss that Beard was available for another cookbook, and my boss seemed interested; Frank Taylor, that is.  And the question was what kind of a book should he do.\n\nQ:  The question between you and Frank Taylor?\n\nFerrone:  For the staff altogether.  And there’s some doubt as to how it came about, but I think it was Frank’s wife, Nan Taylor, who said, “It’s time we had another good basic cookbook.  We haven’t had one since Fannie Farmer and Irma Rombauer.”  So that’s how the idea got started.\nWe went off for a posh dinner at Chambord, Frank, his wife, Jim, and I, to finalize this arrangement.  At that time, the Chambord was the upscale French restaurant in New York.  I recall that the dinner costs like $110, which was astronomical for those days, but that’s where it all started.  When the book was published, it was published as an original paperback.  It got some publicity from Craig Claiborne in the Times, and it sold out all over town and sold three hundred thousand copies in its first year.\n\nQ:  How did he feel about it being an original paperback, do you recall?\n\nFerrone:  As being a paperback at all, you mean?\n\nQ:  As opposed to a hardback, yes.\n\nFerrone:  Well, we weren’t in the business of doing hardcover books.\n\nQ:  You mean Dell wasn’t, yes?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  But still, that didn’t bother him?\n\nFerrone:  No.  It reversed the process, because ultimately it was reprinted in hardcover.\n\nQ:  People seem to treasure those early copies.\n\nFerrone:  Well, the early James Beard Cookbook had a photograph of Jim beaming over an enormous platter of choucroute garnie, which many people found gross, but it was essential Jim, really.  I was there when the picture was taken.  I remember it quite well.  So in subsequent editions, you find Jim benignly stirring an oyster stew.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Was Dell surprised at how well it sold?\n\nFerrone:  Everybody was surprised at how well it sold.\n\nQ:  Do you remember what their expectations were?\n\nFerrone:  No.  But, you know, it was a mass-market book, and in those days we did enormous printings, fresh printings.  Well, three hundred thousand copies in its first year.\n\nQ:  That’s great that this was so successful.\n\nFerrone:  So that was the only in-house book I did with him.  I did do a revised version of his Fowl and Game Cookery.  It was one of his early books, which we redid at Harcourt Brace as Fowl and Game Bird Cookery, which I largely revised myself.\n\nQ:  And what about Menus for Entertaining?\n\nFerrone:  Menus for Entertaining was the second book that Jim was under contract for, along with The James Beard Cookbook.  He was supposed to do an international cookbook, but never fulfilled that contract, so Menus for Entertaining was the book he did to satisfy that agreement.  It was as close as we ever came to a collaboration.\n\nQ:  How so?\n\nFerrone:  The idea was essentially mine, and I outlined the book for him and we worked very closely on it.  I wrote bits of it myself.  That’s the only one that—\n\nQ:  What kinds of bits?\n\nFerrone:  Oh, connecting bits or maybe a short introductory paragraph.\n\nQ:  How was the book divided?  Were they seasonal menus or event kind of menus?\n\nFerrone:  There were summer menus.  There were cocktail buffets, there were outdoor picnics, holiday dinners, breakfasts.\n\nQ:  By this time, of course, he was quite well known.  Did he have any sense of what his role was vis-à-vis the public?\n\nFerrone:  Well, I’m sure he did.  He was greeted all over town with great affection and great recognition.\n\nQ:  Let’s think about that a little bit.  You ate out with him a lot in restaurants, yes?\n\nFerrone:  A lot.\n\nQ:  And most of them were in the Village?\n\nFerrone:  No.\n\nQ:  So where did you go?  What kinds of restaurants did you go to with him?\n\nFerrone:  A lot of French restaurants, French and Italian.  One of his favorite restaurants was Quo Vadis.\n\nQ:  Quo Vadis.  What did he like about it?\n\nFerrone:  Well, the food was great.  The reception was great.\n\nQ:  Where else?\n\nFerrone:  The Four Seasons, which he helped put together.  All the Restaurant Associate restaurants, you know, Forum of the Twelve Caesars.\n\nQ:  Was he ever critical of their menus?\n\nFerrone:  I don’t recall specifically.  The one restaurant that he liked down here was the Coach House, which was his home away from home.  We often ate there together at Christmastime, but also during the year.\n\nQ:  What did he like about it?\n\nFerrone:  Again, the food was quite wonderful.\n\nQ:  What kind of style at that point was the food?\n\nFerrone:  It was a strange mixture of American food with Greek touches, because the owner was Greek.  They had a good bakery there.  John Clancy provided wonderful desserts.  I’m just trying to think whether John was his full-time chef.  I think he may have been.\n\nQ:  But you didn’t go to little neighborhood places at all?\n\nFerrone:  Oh, a lot of them.  We used to go to small dining restaurants, Rocco’s on Thompson Street, and—I’m just trying to think of the other one up the street.  The restaurant that he tried to buy Gran Titcino, which was around for a thousand years, and Jim wanted to buy it.  At one point, he was desperate to start a restaurant of his own and tried to interest Helen Evans Brown in joining him in that venture.\n\nQ:  Why did he want to do that?\n\nFerrone:  I can’t explain his urge to want to run a restaurant, but he did, and he explored all sorts of places.  He came close to buying Gran Titcino. but the owner changed her mind at the last moment.  He was so disappointed.  He looked down in Maryland at the Maryland shore for a place, and he told Helen Brown he would move to the West Coast if necessary, that she would join him in a restaurant.  Well, he finally gave up on the idea, but he persisted for a long time.\n\nQ:  Because surely he knew how much work it would be.\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  He was acting as advisor to restaurateurs, so he knew perfectly well what he was in for.\n\nQ:  When you went to restaurants with him, was he expected to pay?\n\nFerrone:  Generally not.  He would leave a generous tip, but it was rare that he would—if I took him, quite a different thing.  We used to eat at La Gauloise over here on Sixth Avenue, too.  This was before your time, I think.\n\nQ:  In New York, yes.\n\nFerrone:  In New York.  What other restaurants did we go to uptown?\n\nQ:  How would you decide where to go?  Or how would he decide?  What mood he was in?\n\nFerrone:  Probably he was invited.\n\nQ:  Oh, interesting.\n\nFerrone:  Because appearing at a restaurant was a kind of publicity for the restaurant.\n\nQ:  It was a kind of publicity?\n\nFerrone:  Yes, an imprimatur.\n\nQ:  Did you notice press paying attention to that or what?\n\nFerrone:  Not to visit, not to an ordinary visit, no.\n\nQ:  I was wondering if he had any important influence on you, if you could describe that in any way.\n\nFerrone:  Well, certainly on my cooking habits since he was my guru in the kitchen.  I would pick up new ideas from him every time I went to have dinner at his place.  He opened up my cooking ability.\n\nQ:  Actually, who taught you to cook?  How did you learn?\n\nFerrone:  No one taught me.  My repertoire was very small when I first came to New York.  I had a few Italian dishes under my belt, I think.\n\nQ:  From your home?\n\nFerrone:  Yes, but my repertoire expanded enormously after eating with Jim for a year or two, and he influenced me in my style of living and the furnishing of my apartment.  I arrived with nothing in New York and had a tiny studio apartment with three sticks of furniture in it, a sling chair, a table with two chairs, a studio bed, a kitchen that was carved out of the wall, no bigger than six feet long, I would say.  And I moved from place to place, accumulating antiques until I came to the present apartment, where I amassed more than I needed.  But Jim and I together collected Asian ceramics, used to give each other Christmas presents of porcelain.\n\nQ:  Where did he get the taste for Asian ceramics?\n\nFerrone:  Where did he get it?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFerrone:  Well, in Portland, growing up, he was greatly influenced by the Chinese chef that his mother employed and his father’s close connection with the Chinese community.  It was rumored that his father had a Chinese mistress and may even have had a Chinese child.\n\nQ:  What was his father’s connection with the Chinese community?\n\nFerrone:  He was a customs officer, customs inspector, and I guess in the line of his work he was involved in the Chinese community.  And his mother employed a Chinese chef in her home.\n\nQ:  Did you ever talk about that chef with him?\n\nFerrone:  He writes about him quite—\n\nQ:  Yes, but I wondered if he ever talked to you about it.\n\nFerrone:  Not specifically, no, but that chef was a great influence on his cooking habits, I think.  But he was surrounded by Chinese artifacts, too, I think.\n\nQ:  You mean that his mother would have purchased?\n\nFerrone:  His mother would have collected.\n\nQ:  And used in their surroundings?\n\nFerrone:  Well, I don’t know how it might have been used.\n\nQ:  Tell me which things in here that you purchased from the auction after his death.\n\nFerrone:  Well, the Chinese Ancestors, the hanging, was given to him by his childhood friend, Mary Hamblet, and there’s some ceramics I have over on the coffee table, and there’s a large ceramic artichoke in the corner, which you can’t see from here.\n\nQ:  You wanted them because you liked them or they reminded you of him?\n\nFerrone:  Well, both.  Also these copper candlesticks behind me—\n\nQ:  Oh, they’re beautiful.\n\nFerrone:  —which I think Jim said were eighteenth century French.\n\nQ:  They’re very beautiful.  Did he use that kind of decoration when he entertained?\n\nFerrone:  Oh yes.  That’s something else that he influenced me with, the idea of mixing, for serving food, a mixture of dinnerware rather then the monotonous parade of the same pattern for every course.\n\nQ:  Did he take delight in doing that?\n\nFerrone:  He did.  He would choose dishes to suit the particular food he was serving.  Always very interesting.  And he’d find a lot of his dishes in France, especially in the days when he used to travel by ship.  You know, he would send a barrel of stuff back home. And in the early days he would buy—well, I’m still using dinnerware, dishes that he gave to me after one of his trips.  He would give me nine dishes in case I broke one.  But I have two or three sets of dishes.\n\nQ:  That’s very thoughtful and practical at the same time.\n\nFerrone:  And he gave me a great pile of wonderful Ironstone, English Ironstone dishes that he no longer wanted.\n\nQ:  He would give them to you when he bought new things, or how would that work?\n\nFerrone:  Just discarded.\n\nQ:  Tell me how you found out that he left the royalties of his books to you and what the circumstances of that were.\n\nFerrone:  Well, I had no expectation of anything at all.  At the very most, I thought he might leave me the royalties to one book, particularly American Cookery, which we worked on for four years.  But shortly after he died, I got a telephone call from the executor of his estate, and he and a group from the Manufacturer’s Hanover, the bank handling the estate, were in Jim’s house on 12th Street, and they wanted to come see me.  And in trooped four people, including the executor, Morris Galen, who was a lawyer in Portland.\n\nQ:  And someone that Beard knew?\n\nFerrone:  Not too well.  When he was drawing up his will, he consulted his friend Mary Hamblet for a lawyer, and she had suggested a law firm in Portland, and Galen was the one who was chosen to represent Beard.\nAt any rate, they arrived and broke the news to me that I had been left all the royalties.  I was absolutely stunned.\n\nQ:  It is pretty amazing.\n\nFerrone:  And very lucrative in the beginning years, but there’s so many books out of print now so it’s just a dribble.  But nonetheless, it was enormously generous of him.\n\nQ:  What did you think your role was after he died, either because you had the royalties or because you’d worked with him?\n\nFerrone:  Well, he’d once said to me cryptically, “You’ll know what to do with the books.”  I think he expected me to look after his literary legacy.\n\nQ:  What would that mean?  Keeping the books in print?\n\nFerrone:  Keeping them in print, updating them, revising them, promoting them, all of which I’ve done.  I revised The James Beard Cookbook twice.\n\nQ:  You revised it according to what standard?\n\nFerrone:  Just looking at it and seeing that certain things were dated or things that I knew that Beard wouldn’t have included a second time around, things that were very basic things that were missing.\n\nQ:  You mean like basic recipes that were not in the book?\n\nFerrone:  For example, including a recipe for salsa, which wouldn’t have been a current recipe in Jim’s day, in 1959.\n\nQ:  That book is about to have a big anniversary, isn’t it?\n\nFerrone:  Next month, The James Beard Cookbook will be fifty years old and has been continuously in print all that time.\n\nQ:  Is something special planned for the anniversary?\n\nFerrone:  No.  I tried to interest the Beard Foundation into doing something for it.  I wanted them to do a choucroute garnie dinner.\n\nQ:  Oh, perfect, yes.\n\nFerrone:  But they couldn’t see themselves doing it.\n\nQ:  How does it sell now?\n\nFerrone:  Oh, it might sell—I haven’t looked at recent figures.  It might sell a few hundred copies a year now.\n\nQ:  Tell me about Halo of Truffles.\n\nFerrone:  That came about when Clay Triplette, Jim’s houseman, called me after Jim died and told me there was still a mass of stuff in the basement.  The house had been cleaned out so it could be resold, and so I went and collected, rescued material, not knowing what I was taking, just carrying a couple of shopping bags full of papers home with me and stuffing them under my bed.  I didn’t get to look at them until about a year later and found the correspondence between Jim and Helen Evans Brown.  Jim had kept her correspondence, because they’d always talked of doing a book of their letters.\n\nQ:  Was it in an orderly—\n\nFerrone:  No.  And he had his own letters because Phillip Brown had sent them back to Jim to read before he gave them to an archive somewhere or other.  So it had just happened that Jim had not returned them when he died.  So there happened to be both sides of the correspondence.\nBut as I started reading them, I knew that there was a wonderful story there.  The letters were almost totally undated, so I had a mammoth job of dating them by evidence in the content of the letters themselves or a date saying “Tuesday the 19th,” and having to look at a perpetual calendar to find out how many Tuesdays the 19th there were in any given period.\n\nQ:  Wow.  That must have taken quite some time.\n\nFerrone:  It took me about two years to date the letters.  I did Jim’s first, I didn’t do Helen’s, and I thought Jim’s letters were more interesting anyway.  So I eventually managed to put the collection together, and Helen Evans Brown’s husband, Phillip Brown, helped me with some identification of people who weren’t known to me, referred to.\n\nQ:  His were more interesting because—what would he include in them that made them interesting?\n\nFerrone:  Well, he wrote with more flair, and his life was more interesting, I think.  He traveled a great deal more.  Helen was pretty much—they went to Europe too, but Jim traveled more quite simply and was more active in the food world.  He was doing food demonstrations and acting as consultant to restaurateurs and the food industry, and Helen’s territory was more confined.\n\nQ:  Would he talk about all these things in the letters?\n\nFerrone:  Yes.  The letters are very entertaining, I think, and they talked about the state of food in this country, which is very important.\n\nQ:  In terms of lamenting it, being happy about it?\n\nFerrone:  Lamenting the state of food.\n\nQ:  What did he think was wrong with it or lacking?\n\nFerrone:  Well, that it was pretty much in the hands of the nutritionists and the home economists, who had no idea of the sensuous approach to food, the joy of tasting it and looking at beautiful presentation.  And Jim and Helen were the preachers of good, honest ingredients, seasonal if preferable.\n\nQ:  Of course, that seems very logical and now it’s an absolute mantra.\n\nFerrone:  Yes.\n\nQ:  But at the time, what did it feel like to you?\n\nFerrone:  Well, it was an uphill battle for them.\n\nQ:  Because?\n\nFerrone:  Because they were so dominated culturally by the unimaginative standards in the food industry.\n\nQ:  You mean of the industry, of magazines, of what?\n\nFerrone:  I’m getting tired.\n\nQ:  Okay.\n\n[Recorder turned off]\n\nQ:  When you think of James Beard now, what kind of a man do you see, what kind of person personally and in terms of his influence?\n\nFerrone:  I think he was a very charismatic person who influenced a great many people.  He was generous and quirky and enormously important to the food world and to our cultural life in general.\n\nQ:  Because?\n\nFerrone:  I think he helped to improve the standards of eating in this country immeasurably through his various cookbooks, through his extensive food demonstrations that he did throughout the country.  And, as far as I’m concerned, he was one of my dearest friends, one of my great mentors in all sorts of ways, not only in food, and it was a great joy to be in his company.\nI often think, though, that despite his fame, he wasn’t really happy in his own skin.  I remember one time when he was approaching his seventies, he thought he wasn’t going to live beyond then, and he said in a despairing moment, “The next time around, I want to come back as a devastating, slim, blond baritone.”  But I think that those of us who knew him and loved him wouldn’t want him to come back in any other form then the one he was in.\n\nQ:  Thank you, John.  That’s lovely.  Thank you for sharing your memories with us.\n\nFerrone:  My pleasure.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFerrone – 3 -  PAGE 33\n\n\n\n","description":"John Ferrone was already a respected New York literary editor when he met James Beard and the two became lifelong friends.

She also created a genre, now much imitated by other writers, focused on a single foodstuff.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1927 in California and reared there, she has made her home in New York's Greenwich Village for decades. She lives around the corner from James Beard's cooking school run out of his home. Her only contact was a week's worth of classes there, but they share an abiding passion for American food.\r\n\r\nHer essays in literary journals, major newspapers, national magazines and encyclopedias are written with a grace few food writers can match. She also lectures at museums, universities, state fairs, corn festivals, historical societies and culinary groups. In 1999, her food memoir, My Kitchen Wars, traced her life from her childhoood through her marriage to a college sweetheart, her travails as an academic wife, her own academic career, the women's movement, and her wider success when she found her essential subject: food. TTT\n\nInterviewee:  Betty Fussell     \t\t\t\t\t\t          Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t     New York City\n\nDate:  March 18, 2009\n\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  I’m sitting with Betty Fussell in her apartment in Greenwich Village, and it is March 18th.  Good morning, Betty.\n\nFussell:  Good morning, Judy.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we start, please, with your telling me a little bit about the circumstances of your childhood, where you grew up, your parents. And why don’t we go—\n\nFussell:  Since I live in an 1840 Presbyterian church, former Presbyterian Church, it is, to me, the irony of ironies, because what conditioned my first sixteen years of life was that I was a strict Calvinist Presbyterian.  That’s going to matter about everything, particularly food.  1927, when I was born in Riverside, that part of southern California was entirely colonized by Midwesterners.  That means they brought their food traditions with them, their food biases, their sense of colonic irrigation, their need for reducing all foods to liquid, etc.\n\nQ:  Wait.  Go back about that.  You mean they came with the conviction that colonic irrigation was a good thing, a necessary thing?\n\nFussell:  Yes.  They brought with them the whole baggage of the Kellogg Sanitarium, everything that happened in the Midwest in terms of Puritan food extremities and all.  They were part of their time, that’s all, and they were farmers who were very happy to get off the farm, because this wave of this particular group of Scot Presbyterians, which means they were—Scotch-Irish, which means they were entirely Scot, not a drop of Irish blood, unfortunately, but they’re called Irish because this group of lowland Scots put down in Londonderry on their way to America.  This is the early part of the nineteenth century.  Half of these Kennedys, Erskines, Stevensons, half of them went straight on from the Port of Philadelphia to the Midwest, the other half went down into the Appalachians.  The Appalachian group all became bootleggers during Prohibition.  The ones who went to the Midwest all became complete teetotalers, but this is a very cranky group of people.\n\nQ:  How so?\n\nFussell:  Reading their histories you can see, because when we get to something like John Knox and the Presbyterian Church, from then on there are schisms within schisms of sects breaking off, because they each want their rules, their own rules.\n\nQ:  From then on meaning approximately when?\n\nFussell:  John Knox, seventeenth century.  The great break from the traditional Church of England, which, of course, was the break from the Catholic traditions.  So these are rebellious people who were also poor, these are crofters.  Although every Scotch-Irish person that I know traces his ancestry to Robert the Bruce, it’s all nonsense.  [laughs]  On the other hand, they’re good survivors.  So this has nothing to do with the tradition of colonic irrigations that they brought, but they’re a tough breed, let’s put it that way.\n\nQ:  And your particular family came from what part of that?\n\nFussell:  They came from Ohio and Nebraska and Kansas.\n\nQ:  I mean what strain of that thinking; is what I meant.\n\nFussell:  They were all intermarried.  It’s a tribe.  They’re all intermarried.  Erskines, Harpers would have been west of England, but it comes out of a similar time and similar group.  Stevensons, Scottish again, Kennedys, these are all the Protestant, Protestants in America.  So it was that wave of immigration that preceded the big urban from Europe, from Eastern Europe, the Jewish, the Irish, etc.  So, early nineteenth century as opposed to late nineteenth century.\n\tThere was a depression, which will be relevant because one of the first farm depressions was toward the end of the twenties.  So all of these folk in the Midwest kept pushing further west when it would seem that the farmland is not making them money, any money in Nebraska, then, keep going.\nBoth sides of my grandparents, maternal and paternal, ended up in Greeley, Colorado, at the same time.  That was a mass natural western extension.  That’s the end of the prairies.  Then come the Rockies.  So they met, my parents, mother a music teacher who didn’t get married until she was about thirty-five, father a biology, botany teacher as he became.  When they met, my father had the image of pushing on to California, which was a part of his time, because in World War I he had actually seen the Pacific Ocean, in San Francisco.  So these are all very typical of their time.\n\nQ:  I was interested in your mother because she had trained in New York and—\n\nFussell:  But only at a Bible school briefly.  I mean, she was adventurous in that she had gone from the Midwest to the East, which most people hadn’t, but she was unusual also in being interested in the arts, which none of the rest of them were.  They were all science, doctors, ministers, if they were going into something other than farming, and most of them did.\n\nQ:  But in terms of her marrying your father and his choices in life, that was perfectly normal, or was it?\n\nFussell:  Do you mean to have—what would be abnormal here?\n\nQ:  Well, I guess giving up any sense of what the arts represented and the East.\n\nFussell:  She wasn’t ready to stay in the East.  She was here for schooling and good work schooling.  The Alma White Bible School is part of the—but I don’t think she ever imagined she was going to establish herself separately.  Because what would she make money at?  Teaching without family?  I mean, all these people had thirteen kids on all sides, you know, everybody.  So these huge extended families and they all pitched in to take care of each other.\n\tWhen she was in school, she had a nervous breakdown, so that was unusual.  Again, so she had to go back to the Midwest and be taken care of.\n\nQ:  What did a nervous breakdown mean then?\n\nFussell:  It was a word that was used until what?  We started talking about manic depressive and now we talk about bipolar.  It’s all the same thing, a generic term for a highly alert nervous system that has highs and lows.\n\nQ:  So what situation was she feeling about herself when she met and married your father?\n\nFussell:  Since she was a teacher at the Colorado State Teachers College, which was then Greeley State Teachers College, it became Colorado State Teachers College, put on the map by John Michener, who was an alumnus.\nSo my father at this point had returned there to take his M.A., and my mother was teaching piano there in her mid thirties.  That meant she was a terrific old maid nobody married and not bound for marriage, partly because she was frail.  So she was sort of exempt.  I don’t know how they fell in love and got married, but they did, and whisked off to my father’s first job in Mill Valley, where I wished he’d stayed.  Mount Tamalpais, he used to tell me, he’d talk about.  He loved the countryside, as I understand why that would have suited himself as a botanist just perfectly.\nThey had their first child in Colorado and moved that baby with them to Mill Valley, where he taught at a high school.  They then had another child who died within the year, year and a half, and evidently that tipped my mother back over into the manic depressive, whatever.  They had then moved to southern California, where her parents had already moved because of one of those other children, her sister, my Aunt Lyda, her sister Lyda had moved there.\nSo you can see all of these trends, trains, how people go.  That was in Glendale.  This wasn’t in the same town, but it wasn’t far away.  So they landed in an orange ranch.  They must have put money down on an orange ranch, where they built a garage and that’s where I lived when I was first born.\n\nQ:  A garage?\n\nFussell:  A garage in the orange grove, because the garage was supposed to be before they built the little house.  This is right outside of town in Bloomington, so that land would have been cheap.  Also it was by the cement plant, which made it even cheaper.\n\tSo after my mother died when I was two, my father’s parents moved from Greeley, Colorado, to take care of my brother and me on the orange ranch, but my grandfather was also an osteopathic doctor, so he had an office in town.  Osteopathy is part of this great Midwest health.  You could be a chiropractor or you could be an osteopath.\n\nQ:  He was, as well as his second wife?\n\nFussell:  He was far before his—no, this is my grandfather.  And because he was an osteopathic doctor, there were quite a few in that town, as there would be because it’s of Midwestern origin and Midwestern settled.  But it’s another example of the kind of rebelliousness of this tribe.  They hated medical doctors, they were part of the enemy, the eastern establishment potpourri, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  They were all in the same package of who you hate, who the demons are.\n\tSo there were quite a few osteopaths, and in that osteopathic office was a woman who would have been a feminist without knowing it.  Again, she was in her late thirties or maybe forty.  I’m sure my father was desperate to find someone to take care of the children because he wasn’t going to do that, men don’t do that, and he was teaching, but you know, it’s just unthinkable, so he first brought his parents. \nMy grandfather introduced the woman who was sharing his office, Elizabeth Blake, and so they got married, but we continued to live with my grandparents because this was a career woman, which was very rare.  She wasn’t going to alter her doctoring career for anything like children.  So we continued to live with the grandparents.\n\nQ:  I guess I did read this, but why did he think she would take care of the children?\n\nFussell:  I think, as is easy for me to understand, “Oh, how wonderful, we’ll get married.  She will be a mother, even though we have my parents to really take care of them.  But all children need a mother and that would be convenient for everybody.”\n\nQ:  Interesting.\n\nFussell:  Do I think he didn’t know her very well?  Yes, he married within a year, so he was desperate, and for himself, I think, and I think desperately full of guilt too.\n\nQ:  You were very, very young.  Do you have any sense of what the food was like when you were that little?\n\nFussell:  Zero.  I don’t remember anything until I was about three.  Except for the butter; did remember the butter.  Remember being on the farm in Gilcrest where the grandparents had taken us.  We were shipped off immediately after her death, Bobby to another aunt in Colorado, and me to the grandparents in Gilcrest, which was a farm, which I have wonderful photos of, which I’ve actually visited, but it’s now—guess what?  It’s a feedlot.  Isn’t that nice?  So is Greeley.  Greeley is one of the country’s major feedlots, or has been until Nebraska and Kansas took it over. \n\nQ:  So when does your memory pick up of life either with your grandparents or with this reassembled family?\n\nFussell:  Well, except for this one moment on the farm when I do remember, or I remember being told about it, crawling across the farm floor and opening the icebox and getting a pound of butter and eating it.  That stuck in my memory because I really do love butter.  Okay, sounds logical to me.  Then I don’t remember anything until moving to [unclear], when we just ate very simple food, but that would be the food of the time.  So, Ovaltine and cornmeal mush and toast with brown sugar on it, which my grandpa loved, and milk.  Sunday supper was always that.  My grandmother loved burned toast, so she would deliberately burn it and then scrape off some of the charcoal.\n\nQ:  This was with your grandparents, not after your father remarried?\n\nFussell:  We kept on living with the grandparents, so that marriage had nothing to do with us until later, the kids.  They were our parents, the grandparents.\n\nQ:  How long did that last?\n\nFussell:  We had to go live with the parents, the real parents, when I was six.  So that would have lasted two to three to four to five to six, I guess four years.  Then the grandparents, we all moved in to the parents’ house, because Grandma was sick and she could no longer take care of us and she really needed help.  I guess her son helped her.  I’m trying to think, because the kids, we would have been no good in helping her physically, but I think she went to bed for a while.\n\nQ:  Then who would have been, to use a contemporary word, parenting the two of you?\n\nFussell:  Well, Father did all the cooking, which was an interesting arrangement.  The stepmother never cooked.  Father was used to cooking because he was a farm boy and he did, in the summer, all the canning, he did just like a farmer, and because it was California, you got good produce still.  We would go to Hemet and get peaches and cherries.  This was before agribusiness, but, ah, California was a paradise of natural-growing fruit trees.  We had in our yard a fig tree and a kumquat.  We didn’t have apricot trees, but neighbors did.  Pomegranates we had.  Of course you did.  I mean, you know, it’s California.  The oranges, because those were navel oranges, this was the first winter orange in this country, so that was very exciting.  But where else would it be?  Of course it would be in California.\n\nQ:  At that point when you all reassembled, what did you look like?  How big were you?  Do you have a sense of that?\n\nFussell:  Sure, thousands of photographs.  Short and fat, little round—\n\nQ:  Really?\n\nFussell:  I mean, five years old, I’m a butterball in a little sunbonnet, I’m Midwestern.  Hundreds of photographs.  I don’t have any immediately to hand off, but I do have thousands.\n\nQ:  Was there anybody who actually paid attention to you as a girl and the needs of a girl growing up?\n\nFussell:  It was certainly complicated.  The grandparents very quickly—we were all living together.  Everybody hated each other.  The grandparents did not get along with the stepmother.  The stepmother, as I’ve depicted her, is a kind of witch, but that’s what she remains in my head, one of the most unlovely, unloving people I have ever known.  So I have not been able to revise my childhood memories of this.  She certainly didn’t want to be bothered with children and she didn’t have any idea what to do with them, not a clue.  She had two sisters.  One of them, Aunt Minnie, was wonderful, had kids, knew exactly, but this one was not Aunt Minnie.\nOn the other hand, the stepmother was under great constraints by the Presbyterian grandfather, who was an Elder, and that meant something.  So they were very critical of her always.  They set the rules on how to bring up the children and that was very strictly, and she, of course, probably doubled that.  The difference between was that the grandparents were really full of love and the stepmother was not.\n\nQ:  The grandparents full of love toward—\n\nFussell:  Toward the children.  Yes, they really loved us.  The stepmother did not.  My father just stepped back and out of it.  He was a very remote kind of person anyway.  He just let other people do it.\n\nQ:  Do you have any specific memories of your personal interaction with her?\n\nFussell:  With her?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFussell:  Oh, sure.\n\nQ:  I mean, where you could like give me a little story, a little report of what dealing with her was like?\n\nFussell:  Yes.  I was terrified of her.  She had a very short temper and a very sharp temper, and my father was exactly the opposite; no emotion was ever expressed.  You had no idea what he was saying or feeling, but he was a kindly man in there somewhere, it just wasn’t expressed.  Grandparents were kindly and very patient as grandparents are apt to be, but she was quick and sharp.  And she had her office in the house, so you had to stay away from the middle of the house, living room, the treating room, which is her office.  She must have done that at some point to save money, because she had the office downtown, but at some point she moved into the house.  Then they had a sign out front, Elizabeth Harper, D.O., and that’s where my brother and I got the word “D.O.”  Then behind that was the dining room.  Behind that was the kitchen.\n\nQ:  And D.O., excuse me, was doctor of osteopathy?\n\nFussell:  Yes.  If I wanted to do anything, I had to ask her permission and I would rehearse.  My brother and I had adjoining bedrooms upstairs.  My brother’s four years older, and we were not close.  He didn’t want to bother with me, you know; I’m too young.  I’m too young.  Besides which, unfortunately for him, my grandparents babied me because I was a girl, and therefore I did what they said, and they bullied him because he was a boy and he rebelled.\n\nQ:  You referred to rehearsing.  What kinds of things would you rehearse?\n\nFussell:  I would rehearse if I wanted to—this would be, let’s say, when I’m about getting on in elementary school, perhaps, and wanted to have a friend over.  Okay.  I would rehearse what I was going to say and how I was going to ask it and what was maybe the best time to approach her.  I’d listen to see what she was doing downstairs and all, see if I could pick up on her mood and then I would go down and ask her, “Could I have Shirley come over to play tomorrow after school?”\nYou never knew what her response would be.  She could snap your head off and say, “No, you haven’t even cleaned your room,” blah, blah, blah.\n“Okay, okay, okay.”\nThen you run back up to your room in tears.  You could never solve when was a good time to approach her.  It was just sheer will and enjoyment of her power, absolutely, and she had a lot of power.\n\nQ:  Did she have any role in how you all ate or didn’t eat?\n\nFussell:  Only in the sense that she was ready to give you an enema after the meal.\n\nQ:  Explain that a little bit.\n\nFussell:  Father prepares.  She was sort of in charge of the enema-giving, which was rigorous and frequent.\n\nQ:  Immediately after a meal?\n\nFussell:  Not immediately, but if there’s any stomach complaint of any kind, it’s time for an enema.  So, of course, you learned not to complain about anything.  She had no interest in food whatsoever, except for her notion of what good healthy food was.  You were never to have—her notions—you were never to have cucumbers and cherries at the same time.  If you had that by mistake, before you knew it, she would bawl you out.  There was a whole world of things that you were never to put in your mouth.\n\nQ:  What would cucumbers and cherries have resulted in?  What inhospitable—\n\nFussell:  Oh, gas, bad intestinal upheavals.  I think you were supposed to never have cucumbers and milk either.  I can’t remember why that is a—\n\nQ:  Those cucumbers.  [laughs]\n\nFussell:  Those cucumbers, and they were frequent.  We could grow them in our yard when the victory gardens came along, but they were cheap.  \n\nQ:  What about the Fletcherizing?\n\nFussell:  Everyone was Fletcherizing then of our particular ilk.  I remember it as doing it in the thirties.  Of course, that’s when I was a kid.  I think it started in the twenties and it became faddish.  Who was I just talking to, said, “Can you believe it?  We had to chew a hundred times.”\n\tI said, “Oh, my god.  You too?”  I can’t remember where that person was from, but it wasn’t just Midwest.  It had taken over as a faddy thing and taken over seriously in families like mine, where the whole life of the food was centered on the digestive tract and its dangers.  You know, you apply a whole Calvinist theology.  If the body is impure to begin with, you’re trying to reduce the body at all times to spirit, because bodies are bad.  Anything physical is bad, then everything that goes with that, including emotions, including desires.  Okay, physical is out.\n\nQ:  Could you explain, for example, so you’re at the dinner table.  Paint the picture for me of what that was like with the instruction that you had to chew away.\n\nFussell:  At the dinner table we all, after the prayer given by Grandfather, often very lengthy, we sat there in silence and chewed.  Nobody talked.  Chewed.  Or you could ask, “Could I have another helping of—” blank, blank.  Nothing was discussed.  Everything was taboo.  Religion was taboo.  No one had any social consciousness whatsoever, so politics were taboo.  There wasn’t any.\n\nQ:  All right.  So you’re chewing.  What was on your plate in front of you?\n\nFussell:  Typically in about the mid-thirties, as I remember the evolution of this, first there would be canned peaches that father had made during the summer, which we could then open.  That would be a big treat for dessert.  There was almost always a fruit dessert.  Anything else was too costly and nobody knew how to make it and my father had no interest in it.  That quickly became replaced by Del Monte.  My father adored Del Monte peaches because he didn’t have to make them.  They were so nice and sweet and sliced and slippery, you know.\nIf you were having an occasion of some kind, ice cream was often in the icebox.  These were literally iceboxes.  The iceman came, and because Riverside is quite hot, the iceman had to come every day in the summer or everything would go to pot.\nOtherwise, the food, in the depression we really barely had enough to eat.  Often a dinner would be scrambled eggs and small portions.  That would be a protein, but people liked that because it was soft; you didn’t have to chew it as long.\n\nQ:  So the scrambled eggs would be put on everybody’s individual plate?\n\nFussell:  No, it would be a platter and passed away, and you would be warned not to take too big of a piece.  A piece.  Too big a spoon.  There was always toast.  There was always bread.  It was always store-bought bread, of course.  Let’s see.  It’s pre-Wonder bread days, but there was certainly—Safeway was our major store forever, as I remember.  Safeway must have started pretty early.  That would have been the best deals and they had a lot of stuff.  We seldom had fish.  Because we were not Catholics, we didn’t have catfish on Friday.  When fish was cooked, it was ghastly. It would be a filet of some kind just radically overcooked so it’s white mush.\n\nQ:  Did you have to cut anything into small pieces prior to Fletcherizing?\n\nFussell:  Well, you could spoon it.  You can spoon all of our foods.  The meat was boiled until it was spoonable.  A cheap cut of lamb on the bone would boil for several hours, together with some beans that would boil for several hours, potatoes that would boil for—potatoes tend to be soft anyway.  Crispy was not in the category of taste, not, not, except we did have cereal.  So we had shredded wheat and grape nuts, which I didn’t like.  I liked shredded wheat.  Cornflakes, didn’t like cornflakes because they got mushy, so that crispness got lost.  Oh, and puffed rice was in there in the thirties.  Cereals would have been a good thing, I mean, so we all had cereal for breakfast.\n\nQ:  Did you all eat breakfast together?\n\nFussell:  I think we did.  We got up at five-thirty.  Dad had to prepare to get to class, which would have been at eight, but he wanted a lot of preparation time and he had to drive to his school.  I went to a grammar school that was just down the block, so I could walk to that, but my brother had to walk up another hill.  So, yes, so we allowed plenty of time.  But it really was, it was farmers’ time; that’s when they got up.  We went to bed then at eight-thirty, nine-thirty.\n\nQ:  So if you had to describe your attitude toward food at that time, how would you characterize it?\n\nFussell:  Hated sitting down at the dinner table, because it was silent and full of tension, all the things unsaid.  Longed for treats, but I would help create those by making pretty pictures if we had a salad.  So that could be the canned pineapple ring with the little banana, you know, the phallic banana.\n\nQ:  You were making pretty pictures with the food?\n\nFussell:  Right.  So that’s the sort of thing I was allowed to do.  Liked that.  By the time of Home Ec classes, that would be junior high, that’s later, then you could actually take a hand in making applesauce.  That was fun.  I loved the ability to make something at home, but I would not have ever been allowed to if it hadn’t been a class assignment.\n\nQ:  I guess what I’m getting at, their approach to food didn’t seem to take with you.\n\nFussell:  Food was what you got through.  Food was fodder.  I remember intensely things that I loved to eat, like root beer floats.  Treats like that, treats.  I like cornmeal mush with brown sugar and milk.  So there are a lot of textures I like.  The table, to me, represented something once in a while you could make pretty for Thanksgiving or Christmas.  So it’s the prettification of the table that I looked forward to, not certainly the daily grind, not the chew.  [laughs]\n\tWhen I was invited to friends’ houses infrequently, when I was I was just astonished at what other people ate that was not like this, really astonished and humiliated because chewing a lamb chop took me a very long time.\n\tEskimo Pies were around.  So those little special treats when the ice cream man came by.  And the best thing, I think, in my youth was the U-No bars at movie theaters, because I was allowed to go to the Saturday matinee at movies.\n\nQ:  What was the U-No bar?\n\nFussell:  A U-No bar was a little one, as opposed to the bigger Mars bars and Snickers.  What it was, was, in fact, a kind of chocolate ganache.  We didn’t know what that was.  It was just creamy and smooth and intense, and it was half the size of a Mars or Snickers, but realizing its intensity, if you went at it very slowly, you could make it last the entire movie.  Of course, by that time it had melted entirely all over your hands, but it didn’t matter.  So that was an absolutely memorable taste.\nLoved angel food cake.  Did that come yet?  That was very rare.  How did we get that?  Maybe from a bakery, because it certainly wasn’t made at home.  It was premix time.  I don’t remember other cakes, and I don’t remember people making cookies.  So I think we were getting some store-bought in Safeway, some store-bought cookies.\n\nQ:  When you wrote that there were not special occasions other than Christmas and Thanksgiving and things like that, it interested me that later on in life then you entertained a lot, a lot.\n\nFussell:  Yes, that would make sense.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Tell me why it would make sense.\n\nFussell:  This was an anti and totally asocial family.  Social life resided in the church, not at home.  We never had a dinner party.  There were no friends.  So that didn’t exist.  The only social contacts you were to have, the center of your social life, was to be church, and this is tricky because it meant if I met somebody at school who was not a member of my church, then probably the D.O. said, “No, no, you can’t have it.”  They’re very strict on this.\n\tAt church there would be good church suppers.  Ooh, I loved those.  Hey, there was food.  Casseroles, people would bring things, rice puddings, corn on the cob.  Those were very good.\n\nQ:  Did you bring along, or did you family bring along, any sense of, I don’t know, I don’t want to use a word like “guilt” especially, but that it was inappropriate or wrong to take pleasure in those foods?\n\nFussell:  Oh yes, everything.\n\nQ:  I mean, you tell me.\n\nFussell:  Everything was guilt.  Guilt ruled.  Everything that brought you pleasure was guilty you were guilty of, no matter what.  So there’s only one emotion that was allowable, which was guilt.  [laughs]  And that emotion was cultivated.  That’s not hard to instill in kids anyway, at all possible levels.\n\nQ:  So I guess the church suppers, like what you’ve written about, about your summer vacation food with your father, that would have provided at least an awareness of other possibilities of what—\n\nFussell:  Summer vacation down at Long Beach?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFussell:  Was that it?  I don’t remember.\n\nQ:  You talked about how you could have different foods then, whether they were purchased at some roadside stand or—\n\nFussell:  Okay, I guess I’m thinking of the canning period, because it would be vacation for my father off teaching.  Okay.  Included in that is fieldtrip, fieldtrip food, which as a botanist, biologist he would go off to the desert, so my love of the desert comes entirely through my father, where we would drive into the Mojave and Colorado Deserts, etc., and collect plants at different times of the year, especially spring.  Spring and fall is the best.  And always have to bring sandwiches from home, because there wasn’t anything there.  So we got to have a thermos full of Ovaltine and fried egg sandwiches.  I can eat those to this day with white bread.\n\nQ:  Who made those?\n\nFussell:  It would have been my father.\n\nQ:  Were you ever allowed, before you went to college, into the kitchen to make food yourself?\n\nFussell:  My brother and I did the cleaning.  Yes, we washed the dishes.  I wasn’t allowed to wash; I was allowed to dry.  My brother washed.\n\nQ:  But cooking, not even assembling a sandwich?\n\nFussell:  I think we would have had to ask permission to use the peanut butter.  There was a little larder adjoining the—you had to ask permission for everything.  So, “Can I take some butter out and make myself a peanut butter sandwich?”  If you found someone to ask, that would be okay; otherwise, not.\n\nQ:  This really didn’t change until you went to college, or was there a time prior to that?\n\nFussell:  It did not change until I went to college.  When I went to college, I knew it was going to be different and better.  I guess I write somewhere I would have run away from home by the time I was twelve, but I had zero, had nothing, and I’d seen all those movies.  I knew that if you set out with a handkerchief on a stick, you weren’t going to make it.  You’d be returned with the police, and then you’d really have it.  Then you’d really get it.  So I bided my time.  I said, “The moment I get to college, I’m never going to come back.”  Of course, I had to come back for summers, etc., etc., but, and in effect that’s what I did, I graduated early and then left and didn’t come back.\n\nQ:  Did you have girlfriends that you could in any way discuss these feelings with?\n\nFussell:  I had one really close friend who was an outsider like me.  Her parents were mining engineers and they had left her with the grandmother.  So she was raised by a grandmother.  We became total best friends, and that lasted until five years ago when she died in New York, that we had each other all those years, which was a very great thing.  She didn’t get married and have a family, but she had a very early television career, so she really blossomed.  She had nice parents, though; they were just absent parents.\n\nQ:  Did you ever eat together, the two of you?\n\nFussell:  Yes, and Gran, her Gran, was a good cook and her Gran was from the East and had been married to a doctor, so she was very sophisticated.  That’s where I had the first lamb chop.  Ooh, meat you had to cut with a knife.  How did you do that?  Gran and Pat would laugh at me hysterically as I chewed and chewed and chewed, because I had to get that meat down that you never had.  They would have, oh, broiled tomatoes.  Gran would have had an English-based palate.  That was very exciting.  There would always be something nice.  They would have a fresh salad of some kind, like cut-up vegetables.  We never had anything but iceberg.  They would have had some kind of dessert that would have been sophisticated to me.  I wonder what that would have been?  They might have had a mousse or chocolate pudding or something other than—our puddings were always Jello or Junket.\n\nQ:  I have a brief memory of Junket.  That was a really creepy food.\n\nFussell:  Yes, it had its non-chewable texture.  [laughs] \nAnd when I got to college, though, that was the first real break.  I’m cheating a little, because I had my Aunt Lyda, who was one of the thirteen children of the Kennedys, and that was my mother’s, real mother’s, sister.  That sister took care of my Grandma Kennedy, who pretended to be an invalid for the last twenty-five, thirty years of her life, but who absolutely ruled the roost in that way.\n\nQ:  When you say you were cheating, cheating how?\n\nFussell:  Because Aunt Lyda was a cook.  She was a good cook.  So I had real food at Aunt Lyda’s.  She made things like, not Danish, but pecan sweet rolls, you know, just simple sweet rolls.  She made biscuits.  She made soups.  Good cook.  Now, she’s out of the same kind of background.\n\nQ:  How often would you have been with her?\n\nFussell:  We would get to go two weeks in the summer sometimes, not every summer, but often.  This was really because the grandparents wanted to see us, but also because Aunt Lyda really loved children.  She had three daughters of her own.  They were older than us, but this was a happy family, so that was happy, really happy to be with.  The older cousins babied my brother and me just wonderfully.  That was exciting.  Aunt Lyda had birds, huge cages outside of birds, so beautiful.\nMy grandfather had been a carpenter forever and a douser when they were also in the Midwest.  He would just discover water and dig wells.  Grandmother had been an early woman in the church, and, of course, very much a teetotaler, but she was a commanding creature.  We were all a little bit afraid of her, but I loved her.  She was wonderful.\n\nQ:  When you were anticipating going to college, what was your imagined view of what your freedom would be like?\n\nFussell:  I would be out of prison.  I knew I was in prison.  I was not allowed to have a bicycle.  I was not allowed to be off on my own.  I was not allowed to have dates.  They were carefully discouraged, in effect, too dangerous.  So I knew I was in prison and I just couldn’t wait to escape.\nAnd it really by happenstance worked this way, my best friend and I got to go to the same college.  We didn’t pick it, but my parents wouldn’t let me go to Berkeley, where I wanted to go.  That was too far away.  My friend, Pat, I think had wanted to go to Stanford and didn’t quite have the grades to get in.  So we ended up in the same college, which was a great boon, and joined the same girl gang instantly, which came from all over southern California, except one girl from Chicago and another from another from Peoria.\n\nQ:  How big was the school?\n\nFussell:  This is Pomona College, so there were a total of eight hundred.  My high school was more like fifteen hundred.  So I was scaling down, but it was a very different place.  Formal dinners every night.  That was an extraordinary thing; we had to dress up.  Almost real food was served, as opposed to the daily lunch at cafeteria where it was glop.\n\nQ:  What did that almost real food—\n\nFussell:  I think we had a something meat and like a baked potato, and there would have been courses.  These were served dinners with candlelight.  So we would have three courses.  The first course we’d have a soup or a salad.  In California, salad always comes first.  So a soup or a salad and then our main—but this is wartime, so we’re not eating much in the way of meat.  We’re eating a lot of vegetables, but we’re in California, so we’re getting some pretty good vegetables, not just canned ones.  Dessert was always ice cream, because Pomona College had been bequested a lifetime supply of ice cream by some rich man who thought that the one thing college students would really want is ice cream, and he was right.  We all caught “the freshmen five.”  We all put on at least five pounds.  I think I put on ten.  Because you could have seconds.  You could ask for seconds and get them.\n\nQ:  You couldn’t have done that at home?\n\nFussell:  No.\n\nQ:  I’m just checking.\n\nFussell:  What a silly question.  [laughs]  Breakfast, I remember, you could have a soft-boiled egg or a hard-boiled egg.  I mean, that was a refinement.  We had never ever had anything at home but hard-boiled eggs, except when you were sick, then somebody would make you a soft-boiled egg.\n\nQ:  So on the scale of freedoms that you experienced in this school, I’m wondering where food would have ranked, but also what other kinds of freedoms.\n\nFussell:  Food was not an unmitigated freedom, because you had to dress for dinner and that was a bore at the mood we were in, as we are now—I was sixteen, but most of my pals were seventeen, and there were no men, and this is the middle of the war, so a bit restive with pretending that we’re ladies from the 1930s in our painted-on lines, because there aren’t nylons.\n\nQ:  You would have to paint on those lines for dinner at school?\n\nFussell:  Yes.  Oh yes.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nFussell:  Because we had to have hose.  If you don’t have hose, you paint on your line.\n\nQ:  I see.  For some reason I thought that was when you left school, but not—that’s interesting.\n\nFussell:  No, because you had to wear stockings.  That was the dean’s rule.  So it’s still full of rules.\n\nQ:  Hilarious.\n\nFussell:  The first year was still the euphoria of breaking out of one kind of prison.  By the end of that year, or rather second year—no, it was by the end of that year, because I was breaking rules at Harwood, the rules, the parietal rules, for the girls, there were guys on campus, they were all 4F, but they were treated entirely differently in another part of campus.  They got great food.  They got steaks.  Whatever good food there was, they got, and in abundance.  They could always have seconds.  They ate an entirely different menu.  Some of us waited up there from time to time for money, and that was Frary Dining Hall.  So we got to eat what they ate when we got up there.\n\nQ:  Explain that.  I don’t quite understand how that would have happened.  You got to go up there if you could pay?\n\nFussell:  No, to be waitresses.  To work.  To work as campus services.  Then our eyes were open to the gender distinctions between the glop girls were served and the real food boys were served.  That was a shock.  So euphoria was being constantly mitigated.\nThen there were the rules about coming in.  I think as freshmen we had to come in, be in the dorm by something like ten-thirty.  The guys could be out all night.  Girls had to do their own dormitory cleaning.  Boys got maids.  There was a whole lot that we couldn’t quite put together in our heads, but we knew that boys were different because they were all soldiers off serving in the war and we weren’t.\n\nQ:  The boys who were not 4F?\n\nFussell:  The boys who were not 4F, who would have been at college.  So our sense of gender was conditioned entirely by the war.  Boys fight, girls stay home.  So of course they need protein, as indeed they did.  So of course we give up our butter, our meat.\n\nQ:  But wait.  If these boys were 4F, then they wouldn’t have gone off to fight.\n\nFussell:  No, but I mean they were still treated as—you know, they were boys.\n\nQ:  I know.  I just found it hard to balance that.\n\nFussell:  There’s no problem.  They played football, they’re the big men on campus, they get the jobs.  They run things.  They’re boys.  [laughs] \nQ:  One second here.\n\nFussell:  The generation of the forties.  The Depression conditioned the thirties, the war conditioned the forties, and that’s when the real shocks, the real divisions came in that will—no generation will repeat that.  That will never be the same.  We can have another depression.  We’re not going to have that first shock of huge numbers of our boys going to war without any participation of anybody else except to stay still.\n\nQ:  There obviously were other freedoms, though, that you must have felt exhilarated by.\n\nFussell:  What the main freedom was was intellectually.  Ah!  Ideas, ideas.  So for the first time ever, I found a source to question the Calvinist theology I was raised with, and I had the great joy of instantly becoming a philosophy major.  Ah!  [laughs]\n\nQ:  I was too.  I’m not sure it was the world’s best idea, but nevertheless, it was thrilling.\n\nFussell:  It was thrilling.  My classes were, for the most part, as opposed to high school classes, I was just—I hated things like chemistry.  I memorized.  I was good at memorizing quickly, so I could always get A’s in this stuff.  I never understood a word and had no context for it and didn’t care.  I just wanted to get through it.  I helped my boyfriend get through.  He wasn’t a boyfriend.  I tried to bribe the big, gorgeous black football hero, because we were good about blacks because southern California had a lot of middle-class blacks.  What we were bad at were, we had no Jews.  Zero.  No Jews until the war.\n\nQ:  That’s interesting.  But racial intermixing was okay?\n\nFussell:  It depended.  Black was okay.  Mexican was not.  Mexican was not.  They were the bottom, but they were the immigrants.  They lived in their own town, Casa Blanca, but they came to school.  But none of us would have even talked to them, except I had when I was younger, my friend Juanita, who lived around the corner.  So this was not engrained, but it was just the older you got, the clearer it was that blacks were okay.  Catholics were not.  Italians were not, thereby.  You can’t date him; he’s a Catholic.  So everyone has his own peculiar structure, and this was the structure of the Midwest transported to California at that time.\n\nQ:  Would your own family have asked you about your dates, or would they have acknowledged it was even happening?\n\nFussell:  Oh, it was all a matter of permission, often denied.  So, yeah, asked and investigated.  Since my father taught at high school, he could find out anything he wanted to about any high school boy.\n\nQ:  Did you ever avoid asking?\n\nFussell:  Did I ever sneak out?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFussell:  No, because I couldn’t get back in.  I mean, did I have a key to the house?  No, and I would have had to climb up stairs.\n\nQ:  Now, what about at college?\n\nFussell:  College was different.  I mean, college is not home, so what’s the question on this?\n\nQ:  So in college you could see whoever you felt like and whoever was available?\n\nFussell:  Sure, but I mean, you wouldn’t—oh, of course, of course, and that was a huge freedom.  Yes, dating.  Dating, huge freedom.  The problem there was the parietal rules of having to be in by ten-thirty, so you’d see people very fleetingly and have to run home.\n\nQ:  I see that you did become Phi Beta Kappa.  Did that surprise you that you had this incredible intellectual capacity?\n\nFussell:  No, because I didn’t think of it as an intellectual capacity.  What that was was that I had been trained to be a good student and I was.  I knew how to be a good student.\n\nQ:  You were trained at home or where?\n\nFussell:  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  I was a good student, my brother was the bad.  I knew how to work hard and focus.  I didn’t learn what I should have learned, but I knew how to get good grades and I knew how to work steadily.\n\nQ:  So you did not have a sense of inferiority on that score at all?\n\nFussell:  That’s a little bit complicated and interesting to me. I knew where I stood with my high school friends.  There was a category of Merit Scholars.  I think I was a Merit Scholar at the end.  But I knew I wasn’t like my good friend Tomiko Ito, who went off to a Japanese prison camp, of course, a concentration camp.  I knew who the really smart ones were.  Paul Trotta, who was an Italian Catholic.  They had a sense of intellectual motivation, retention that I didn’t have.  I was a kind of fun-and-games girl with my pal.  We did all the high school plays, we staged the dramas, we’d get out of schoolwork to sit around and write our yearly musicals, in which we’d perform and direct.  That’s the stuff we loved.  We loved all the extracurricular stuff.  We’d play hooky and go down to the movies.  I was not a part of the intellectual band, but I was smart enough and worked enough to always get rewarded as if I were.\n\tThe same thing when I got to college.  I knew I could pick up things quickly, but I knew I was not intellectually as brilliant as blank, blank, blank, and blank.  So I had great respect for people who were smarter than I was.\n\nQ:  Were there a lot of people who were smarter than you?\n\nFussell:  Yeah.  I was really bad with numbers.  There were lots of things I couldn’t do.  I had zero math abilities.\n\nQ:  That was way before any thinking that there were different kinds of intelligence.\n\nFussell:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What I realize now, what I have is a metaphoric intelligence.  I mean, I thought in images, so I could move my mind very quickly and jump all kinds of gaps.  I was not a good analyzer.  So in philosophy, because it’s California, I would get to write short stories or little fictional stories for my exams in philosophy instead of having to do a real analysis you know, catch the spirit of the philosopher John Mills, and recast that in a way that says that’s the way I understand it and it’s a way to approach it.  So I had a wonderful philosophy professor who let me do that.  The moment I’d done all those courses and had to go into symbolic logic, oh, no, no, no, don’t like that, hated the abstraction.  So I’m not good with abstract systems.  So I think I always knew who I was intellectually, but I didn’t want to be intellectual.  I wanted to be a glamour girl.  I wanted to be a musical comedy star, always.  So I had to conceal that, had to conceal the smarts, always, through college.  Painful.\n\nQ:  When did those first desires to perform emerge in you?\n\nFussell:  From the beginning, from the beginning, and that’s movies, I mean, because that was the art form available.  So, Shirley Temple.  Oh, we’re of an age, “Mama, why can’t I have a tap dance lesson?”\n\t“Because it’s evil to dance.”\n\t“Why can’t I have curls?  I’m blonde, but I can’t have curls.”\n\t“Because we wear pigtails.”\n\tI did adore Shirley Temple.\n\nQ:  You must have been quite a looker, actually.  I mean, I doubt that you had a sense of that then, but—\n\nFussell:  When I got to high school, it’s time for Betty Grable, so these were our models, and the models were right there always in front of us.  So we would make the bouffant hairdos and try to look like that.  Good, clean, blonde American girls we wanted to look like, on the screen.\n\nQ:  That desire to perform seems to have been there in the beginning and continued.\n\nFussell:  And the one thing that strikes me now looking back, benefited enormously by the John Dewey system of education.\n\nQ:  Tell me what you mean.\n\nFussell:  Where the bad thing is you don’t learn a lot about factual content; you learn process and creative freedom.  So instead of memorizing Longfellow’s Evangeline, we created, we made a little mockup of Evangeline in the swamp, escaping.  So you’d make a little cardboard three-dimensional.  I loved everything to do with drawing and painting, and I drew all the time, painted all the time.  And I was doing music all the time, because I was supposed to be a piano player like my mama.  Unfortunately, my hands were not nearly as good as my stepmother’s, who could ripple off the keys ever so much better than I could, but I loved playing the piano.  I’m the only person I know who is still taking piano lessons through high school.  I think the furthest I got to was Beethoven’s Pathetique, and I could play the first movement magnificently, the second movement wretchedly because it required technical skills.\n\nQ:  When would it have been that you would have begun to take responsibility for actual cooking your own food?\n\nFussell:  The first time I did it, I didn’t even remember, but all my college friends did, one of our dorms, we had a little subsidiary kitchen that you could use for what, I suppose heating up coffee.  At one point, I thought, okay, well, I’ll give a luncheon.  We’ll have scrambled eggs for luncheon.  So I did a scrambled egg luncheon for about eight good friends.  I can’t remember the occasion.  I remember the pleasure of doing that and knowing I could do that.  Everybody loved the party, so I must have created a party.  Friends now, same friends, say, “Well, don’t you remember you always did the cooking?  Remember those scrambled eggs?”  I didn’t really remember it that way, but okay, okay, I guess I wanted to make food.\n\nQ:  Did you also want to create, I don’t know, an event with the party, a kind of performance event?  How would you have seen that?\n\nFussell:  I would have seen the whole thing as an event.  I’m not just giving them scrambled eggs; I’m giving them some kind of a brunch.  It must have been a brunch.  We shall have a homemade brunch.  So I must have bought some good Danish or something, you know.  The idea was to have a party.  We did have plenty of Ritz cracker and cheesy parties, but that doesn’t count.\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, did your stepmother and father have any idea of the party-ridden life that you were leading?\n\nFussell:  They had no idea of my life in any form, and I was very careful to keep it from them.  I got the lead part of Sabina in The Skin of Our Teeth when I was a sophomore, and had my very first cigarette.  Had to learn to smoke to do it, and I was terrified that they would hear about this play and want to come see it, because if they saw it, they would see me smoking on stage and there would be a fit.  So I did everything to keep that kind of knowledge from them.\nIn a weird way, most of my friends by this time were drinking because they learned to drink beer in high school, and they had cocktails, beer and cocktails, I mean things like whiskey sours, etc.  I was by far the least sophisticated of anybody I knew.\n\nQ:  Still I might add, a delicious taste sensation, the whiskey sour.  [laughs]\n\nFussell:  Yes, yes, once I learned, but I was determined not to drink just because I could.  I was determined not to just say, “Because I can drink alcohol and my parents think it’s a sin, now I’m going to drink it because I can.”  So for a year, until I think my second year, I didn’t.\nYes, I dated.  I was pinned to a fraternity—by the sophomore year the vets were coming back.  The world changed.  Whew.  My first vet boyfriend, he happened to be a teetotaler; he happened to drink milk.  So to the utter scorn of all of my friends, we drank milk while everybody was getting tight on beer, beer and jug wine.  So those were the drinks of choice.\nAt the end of that, when we broke up, I said, “Well, nuts to this milk at parties,” and that’s when I had my first wine, my first drink of wine, and I took to it.  I took to wine and beer, actually, but particularly the wine and experienced all those things that you do if you don’t know anything about alcohol.  So you get drunk and pass out and all that stuff.  Bad training.\n\nQ:  What kind of life did your parents think you were leading, or did they care, or what?\n\nFussell:  Let me think.  Did they care?  I think my father just kept himself remote from thinking about it.  Okay, because, poor dear, he had to drive a taxi in the summers in order to help supply money.  So, yes, he wanted to make sure I got a good education, because he knew the importance of that.\n\nQ:  Well, that’s important.\n\nFussell:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  No, no, no, I have lots of gratitude to him.  He didn’t do it for my brother, however, so I was the one who got favored there.  Stepmother was always wary of everything and always jealous of any rewards that came my way, so I was careful to keep all that from her too.\n\nQ:  At what point did you consciously begin to take pleasure in cooking or eating, and/or eating food, do you remember that?\n\nFussell:  When we ate out at college, that’s when I took pleasure in the food itself, and that was going—I think I mentioned it—to Lucy’s.  The first spaghetti, the first taste of garlic in a spaghetti sauce, the first Italian bread, a French loaf.  And garlic bread, we just adored.  Never had anything like that.  But it was also the whole occasion of eating out that was great, in the restaurant.  Restaurants were costly, so the local one was called the Mish, but that would have been mostly everything from milkshakes to—they must have served liquor.\n\nQ:  So this would have been when, when you had the first spaghetti, garlic bread, that sort of thing?\n\nFussell:  This would be, let’s say, freshmen, sophomore, junior.  Freshmen, sophomore, this was beginning, yes, food is part of that, and always connected with liquor, because Claremont was a dry town, so you had to go outside.  So the Mish couldn’t have had liquor.  You had to go outside town, up on the highway to get liquor, and therefore it’s very much associated, the Sage Hen, a good steak.  Why was it good?  Because you’d just had two old-fashioneds.  The vets had had five martinis, you know.  The correlative of that was Lupe’s, the little Mexican joint, where you would get absolutely sopped on beer and have really good menudo, that kind of thing.\n\nQ:  At this point, preparing that food wasn’t something that had occurred to you as an important goal?\n\nFussell:  No, because, (a), there were no kitchens, I mean, no place to.  It didn’t even occur to me.  Didn’t miss it, never had it, except at Aunt Lyda’s, but she did the cooking, I never did any cooking.\n\nQ:  What made you want to go to New York?\n\nFussell:  Graduation from college.\n\nQ:  It’s not the only choice after graduation, after all.  [laughs]\n\nFussell:  Well, if you’ve listened to the train every night, hopefully every night, in a little town like Riverside, and had dreams of getting out, your dreams get bigger and bigger.  My real dream was going to Europe.  That was movies.  That was Shirley Temple in Heidi, but really off there.  That was cheese.  That cheese and bread looked good.  [laughs]  I have strong images of the Heidi.  I know that whetted my appetite for being in another country.  I’m in a desert.  Where do I want to be?  I want to be in green hills with little sheep.\n\tSo the dream of going abroad was, of course, long thwarted by the war, and the moment the war was over, those troop ships were filled with students and people like me who wanted to get there as quickly as possible on youth hostel trips and everything else.  That’s what I was saving my money to get onto, and New York was to be a stopping point.  I would save my money until I had enough to get on a hostel trip, and instead, you know, I had thirty dollars coming to New York.  So that’s not going to take you very far.  You have to look way ahead.\nSo I met my husband, Paul Fussell, who had been a college sweetheart for a year before he broke it off.  So we met in New York because he was at Harvard and therefore stayed.  Part of his seduction was, “Well, marry me because we’ll go off to Europe on a honeymoon.”\n\t“Okay.”  [laughs]\n\tWell, that got delayed.  “When are we going to Europe?”\n\t“Oh, I’ve spent that money on your ring and my ring.”\n\t“Okay, okay, okay.”\n\tSo we did get married in Cambridge while he was doing his Ph.D.\nBut the cooking, we went off to Cape Cod for the honeymoon.  I had still not done any cooking.  This terrible flat I was in in New York, which belonged to somebody else and I had rented the bedroom, cooking was really prohibited on their little tiny stove.  So in any case, I wasn’t skilled to do that, so I didn’t really.\n\nQ:  Had he cooked at that point?\n\nFussell:  Oh, heavens, no.  [laughs]  His father was a lawyer.  His mother was a housewife with a maid.  Nobody cooked.  And his grandmother was a teacher of elementary school who was the president always of the Browning Society, so she never cooked.\n\nQ:  You mean she was busy?\n\nFussell:  She was very busy.  She was a career woman.  So I never cooked, really, until the honeymoon.\n\nQ:  I’m sorry, didn’t cook until?\n\nFussell:  Until we got married.  And the food he had eaten at graduate school was garbage.  You know, everybody’s living as cheaply as possible.  The one-dollar “chink” meals, you know.\nSo we rented a house that had a kitchen, and because we were so excited to be on—it wasn’t on the beach, but it was on a point of land with water all around it, this is a real house.  This is wonderful, exciting.  You had to rent it for the summer to get it at all in East Orleans, where we’d never been.  We just knew it was Cape Cod and it was near a beach.  So we asked friends to come, because there seemed to be a big room with a lot of little cots, and to our astonishment, they did, but in droves.  So suddenly I was cooking for a lot of people without a clue of what to do except learn very quickly.  We did have this wonderful—these two Waring blenders.  Ah, that was a godsend.  One for drinks and one for sauces, soups, purees.\n\nQ:  So how did you go about cooking?  Did you read cookbooks?  What did you do?\n\nFussell:  No, didn’t have time.  That’s a good question.  I wonder why I haven’t thought about that.  There was nothing in the newspaper.  Did I even read the newspapers?  Don’t know.  Never read the women’s page.  Never read recipes.  So what was I using?  Oh, I know, I know.  I was given Good Housekeeping.  In 1947 I was given that.  Ah, how could I forget this?  The wife of one of Paul’s graduate student friends, who’d been a marine colonel, and they had three kids and his wife had kept a little loose-leaf notebook of her recipes, and she very kindly gave that to me as a wedding present.  That was probably the best wedding present I got, and that was her typed-up recipes for brownies and tuna casserole.  You know, enough to get you through for many, many a meal.\n\nQ:  And things like that?\n\nFussell:  Yes.  I’d never heard of Joy of Cooking, so the Good Housekeeping would have been my compendium.  I’d never heard of Fannie Farmer.  I’d never heard any of the standards.  My father never used a cookbook; he just cooked out of his head.\n\nQ:  A farm cook.\n\nFussell:  Yes.\n\nQ:  But you had, at least, watched someone can.\n\nFussell:  Yes.\n\nQ:  You had a sense of the cycle—\n\nFussell:  But didn’t like canning.\n\nQ:  You didn’t like canning or canned food?\n\nFussell:  I didn’t like canning, because it’s very, very hot in the summer and it was always, you know, “Get out of the kitchen.  I’m canning.”  Dangerous boiling water and it was a very tiny kitchen.  There wasn’t room.  I liked the results.  I liked the stewed tomatoes, a lot of stewed tomatoes.\n\nQ:  So do you remember, there you were in East Orleans, what shopping was like, what any sense of how you got that food into the kitchen?\n\nFussell:  What was shopping like?  I think this is pre-farmers’ markets.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFussell:  I’m trying to think what was available at the Cape.  There was the duck farm down the road, so you could go get a duck.  No, you couldn’t buy the duck; you bought their duck pies, which were delicious.  You could buy clam pies there too.  We could buy lobsters.  We could buy seafood, clams and things.  Learned to steam clams at home.  This was really very much living on what the produce was.  There must have been a supermarket where we got our store-bought bread and butter.  Learned how to do that.  I’m sure we took the little Volkswagen.  I think Paul probably helped on this at first, because we’d be shopping in quantity for all our parties for all these friends who stayed.  So, yes, that was a year of experimentation, but it’s easy to learn by doing, and it’s also easy to rescue failed foods.\n\nQ:  Or not.  [laughs]\n\nFussell:  Or not.  You try not to do things that you think are going to be difficult, like a pork roast you’ve never seen before.  So lots of hamburgers and things you could do on a grill.  I don’t think we had a grill, but we had a stove with a frying pan.\n\nQ:  Did Paul participate?\n\nFussell:  No, no, no, no.  He was a man.  Zero interest in cooking.  That’s women’s work.\n\nQ:  Did you feel it at all a burden, the cooking?\n\nFussell:  I felt the relentless cooking for friends a burden just because we hadn’t expected to have the onslaught we had, and they stayed.  This was kind of free bed and board at the Fussells, and we had really sort of presented it with a very open end.  At that time there was a clutch of friends from college that were mutual friends, so I mean, this is both real pleasure and oh, my god, will they ever leave.  [laughs]  This is before anyone’s getting married or living in houses, so whoever was there to purvey, purvey.\n\nQ:  It must have been so incredibly different from the atmosphere that you grew up in.\n\nFussell:  It was fun.  Yes.\n\nQ:  I mean, it’s hard for me, I mean in my own life, but let alone anybody else’s life, to separate women’s freedom, sexual freedom, food freedom.  I mean, they all kind of went together, I guess.  I don’t know how you experienced that.\n\nFussell:  Sexual freedom is not part of my—I didn’t experience sexual freedom.  Let’s put it that way.\n\nQ:  At that point.\n\nFussell:  No.  What I did was sexual expectations, in every sense.  No real sexual exploration before marriage, and the responsibilities, the whole coupling, a marriage had much more to do with, “Ack.  What is this?” rather than a kind of liberation into it, and certainly not connected to food at that moment.\n\nQ:  When you say, “What is this,” do you mean sex?\n\nFussell:  Yeah.  Yeah.  How does it work?  I mean, not that there hadn’t been enormously heavy petting, but it was different, very different, and we were both very, very inexperienced in terms of real coupling.  Paul had never experimented in the army.  I mean, his pals had taken the advantage of—I mean, making use of the privilege of being in Europe with different boys and available girls.  But Paul was much too frightened of sex to do that.  We were both frightened of sex.  God, it took us a long time to get over that.\n\nQ:  Did you chafe at all at what was expected of woman in terms of the cooking, the cleaning, the more inhibited vocational opportunities?\n\nFussell:  Chafed a lot at that.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Can you describe any of that?\n\nFussell:  Yeah.  “What is this?”  It was my husband saving up all his socks to be darned until after we were married, so that they get darned.  Oh.\n\nQ:  Did you know how to darn?\n\nFussell:  I knew how to darn from my grandmother, because she had a darning egg.  But he had a lot of socks.  I was supposed to do all the washing and ironing.  I had never ironed men’s shirts.  I didn’t know how to do any of that.  I learned.  The expectations were that I was going to be his mother without the maid.  That’s what’s interesting, looking back.  His mother didn’t do a lot of that either.  His mother was a very good sewer.  But his mother loved housecleaning.  His mother was an impeccable cleaner.  So there was a huge gender division in his family between smart lawyer father and a housemaid mother, even though they had a maid.\n\nQ:  Was she smart?  She must have been smart.\n\nFussell:  She was smart, but uneducated.  She was eighteen, married out of high school, and had her first baby almost immediately and changed from a very pretty dark-haired Irish girl to fat and stayed fat.  So Paul had this odd, weird combination, as I tried to ponder it, between—his expectations were that any woman would be his mother.  At the same time, he had real contempt for her because she wasn’t educated, and what he had was extreme respect for and ambition for education.  So that was complicated.  But I kept saying to myself and to him for a while, “Why have I been educated, a good education, a B.A.?  Why have I been educated to do nothing but darn socks?  I don’t understand this.”  So, yeah, I think this group—so we all had babies.  I didn’t as quickly as my pals, because I chafed under this.  I was one of the last of my girl group to get married and they almost had babies instantly.\n\nQ:  But you were fairly young when you got married.\n\nFussell:  Twenty-one.  Twenty-one.\n\nQ:  That’s a hard age to think of as one of the last of your group.\n\nFussell:  Most of my friends in high school got married out of high school.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nFussell:  Okay, different world.  So you were expected to get married around eighteen.  If you got through college, well, gee, you’ve already delayed it four years.  Time to hitch.  Time to start producing.\n\nQ:  You seem to have had, and I imagine still do, incredible energy so that you squeezed in an awful lot, whether you were reading or going to school or performing in amateur productions or—\n\nFussell:  Right.  I inherited my mother’s manic energy.  I think I, hopefully, bypassed the other part of it, but the energy, yeah, I’ve always had a lot of high nervous energy, none of it is backed by physical.\n\nQ:  Put to very productive use, though, it seems like.  Was that in any kind of conscious fashion?\n\nFussell:  No, I think I always had a very practical side to—you know, that’s not quite right.  That’s not right at all.  I had an intense desire to keep busy, so when I was in the household and miserable, as long as I was doing something, they’d let me alone.  So if I were drawing, I drew endless reams of stuff because it looked as if I was doing something.  If I was sitting reading, I wasn’t doing anything.  So doing, as opposed to reading, became a lifelong habit, I think.\n\nQ:  And Paul didn’t really care what you did as long as you didn’t interrupt his—\n\nFussell:  Essentially right, as long as I didn’t interrupt and interfere with anything that—I think it was hard on him when I—I mean, he was very skeptical of my wanting to take a M.A. while he was finishing his Ph.D., but he couldn’t really rationalize not, because he had a huge educational mission in himself coming back from the war.\n\nQ:  That’s what he saw for himself?\n\nFussell:  Not only himself, but that was going to save the world.  I mean, everybody had to be educated.  So he didn’t really approve, because what was I going to do with that, and my rationale at the time was, “Well, then I will be equipped to teach after we have the children and after they’re grown.”  You know, then I’ll always have some kind of job, skills, as I’d left the job track.  That was enough to get by at the time.  It was harder to justify when I wanted to do the Ph.D.  Then I used the rationale, “Okay, I’ve been teaching Shakespeare for a couple of years, but I’ll never be able to advance in salary.  I’ll still be getting only $800 a year because I’m not a Ph.D.,” which was true, but on the other hand, by the time I got the Ph.D., the job market fell off.\n\nQ:  What about cooking?  At what point did you take any real pleasure in cooking, do you think?\n\nFussell:  I think when we came back from the Cape and moved into an apartment in Boston, and that was the year which I instead of—I mean, I could have gone out and tried to find a job in Boston and could have done so as a secretary or something.  I didn’t want to do that.  I didn’t want any more made work, because I felt I’d been doing that since age twelve.  I had to do a little piecework in order to bring in money.  I wanted to do something I really wanted to do.  I wanted to do two things.  I wanted to be a good wife, learn how to be a housewife, and I wanted to take an M.A. the next year.  So, okay, so I had to learn German and Latin from scratch and had to brush up my French.  I did have French.  You had to have three languages.\n\nQ:  You mean to get in?\n\nFussell:  To get in, just to get in, just to apply.  So, okay, so I had my work cut out, so that meant word cards at home, and because I was a good student, I’m good at that, I can do that, I can work by myself.  And the pleasure in breaking the day, Paul would be off at Cambridge doing his work in Widener Library, and during the day I would do the shopping and plan what would be for dinner, and that became fun.  The deterrent there was we had no money.  So you had to shop very frugally and I didn’t go far afield.  I could have gone to Italiantown, which I didn’t know about, but that would have taken too much time.  If I’d done that, I would have learned a lot more about cooking fast.  But just at home I learned what would, (a), give Paul pleasure and me pleasure, and then because Paul is really demanding, he loved to have parties because he wanted people around on his terms, so we began to give parties.  Then we got, even then, known for our parties, because the food was good and we knew what a party was.\n\nQ:  So what was that food, with no money and limited imagination?\n\nFussell:  The food would have been clam dips.\n\nQ:  No, I meant first what you ate together.\n\nFussell:  What we ate together would have been casseroles, since spaghetti we wouldn’t know.  I would learn how to cook spaghetti.  I’m sure the sauce was canned.  It would be very primitive.  This would be the first of the 1950s.  What’s available then?  We would not be getting good bread.  We would not be getting anything.  Just putting anything together on a plate was better eating than Paul had done for his two previous years in graduate school where he was eating out all the time, fast food joints, essentially.\n\nQ:  Did it give you any pleasure to do this?\n\nFussell:  Yeah, because it’s discovering, I’m discovering a world, I’m discovering a world of food, and everything is new.  How you cook spaghetti.  I think by then we were learning that you’re supposed to cook it, not into the soup that it had been.  You could get it out of something other than the Franco-American can where it’s already made mixed with its sauce.  That was exciting.  I think using garlic was exciting, as we knew about that now from Lucy’s and John’s.  We could make our own garlic bread because we could get Italian bread there.\n\nQ:  Did you have girlfriends that you talked about any of this with?\n\nFussell:  Didn’t have any friends.  Didn’t know anybody.  Paul had to supply—Paul’s brother had gone to Harvard, so his friends were all the older couples who went to graduate school at the same time that his brother had befriended.  It was a characteristic pattern to Paul.  So he fell into his brother’s group and I fell into the same group.  Nice people, nice people from all parts of the world.  The best cooks were from the South, Mississippi.\n\nQ:  Wait a minute.  The best cooks from the South, what do you mean there, in terms of his friends?\n\nFussell:  Yeah, a graduate couple where the wife was a cook and she was a very good cook.  So you’d pick up things from people like that.\n\nQ:  Think back to that couple.  They would have had you to dinner, they would have had parties, what?\n\nFussell:  They would have had beaten biscuits and ham.\n\nQ:  And invited you over?\n\nFussell:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Mostly, this is graduate school, so mostly whatever it is is going to be a canned ham.  They might have had a real ham from the South, so that would have been my first real salt-cured ham.  I mean, that was a discovery.  Yeah, how wonderful.  I think probably she baked pies, so we would have had good fruit pies, although we would have known about good fruit pies in California, because fruit was there, so you could make those.  Aunt Lyda made good fruit pies.\n\nQ:  Did you have any emotion about the idea of cooking, whether it was disparaging or a value or anything?  I mean, did you categorize what that cooking role was in your head?\n\nFussell:  The cooking role was, first, necessary, and was something I had to do and had to learn about real fast.  So that wasn’t an immediate pleasure, but the more I did it, the more pleasurable it got as I learned about what the food was that I was cooking.  So that evolved into a real looking forward to the task of and the consumption of, particularly when that was extended into a party.  I think that’s the first time with other people.  These were all couples, more settled than we were.  Some had children, etc., and they all had a sense of cooking that was different from any I had experienced.  So I began to say, “Hey, this is nice.”  This is family cooking.  This is pleasurable.  It’s a way to have a good time with friends.  There’s a center to it that is other than alcohol, which had been the driving force for all these guys and then the girls with them.\n\nQ:  So any residual sense of the way cooking and eating was in the home where you grew up dissipated or wasn’t a problem?\n\nFussell:  Well, it just turned from being something you got through to something that became you could look forward to.  But I’m sure, well, I knew how to make Jello, so there are a lot of continuities.  You relied on the things you knew.  Jello would have been a big one.\n\nQ:  A big which, though.  [laughs]\n\nFussell:  A big continuity.  And adding more stuff to it.  I mean, I’m sure we kept adding more stuff, more unlikely stuff.  I can’t remember when—when did cake mixes come in, brownie mixes?  In my memory it seems to be much, much later in the fifties.  Whenever it came in, we certainly used them immediately, and grateful, grateful for them.  Instant cakes, yes.  Instant brownies, especially, yes.  That was a big boom.\n\nQ:  Did you begin to take a certain amount of pride in your own skills?\n\nFussell:  I got that through the parties.  I got it from praise from other people, would say, “Hey, that tastes good.  What’s in it?”  I would think back, and then it would—doesn’t everybody do this?  And I found that, no, everybody didn’t do it in the same way.  I still think my big thing was presentation.  I had a use of dramatic flair to lay things out so people thought the food was better than it was.  No, the context was good.  So we tried to make it exciting.\n\nQ:  What about Paul?  Did he enjoy that part of it?\n\nFussell:  He loved being a host.  Not the food, much more the liquor, but he loved, yes, being the host.\n\nQ:  In any case, as your skills and people’s response to your skills developed, this was something you could take pride in rather than not take pride in.\n\nFussell:  Yes, this was such an easy way to get approval.  I don’t think I’ve ever gotten over that.\n\nQ:  Easy compared to?\n\nFussell:  Well, obeying your mother, obeying your husband, trying to fit in as a Californian with easterners you don’t understand at all, trying to figure out the rules of anything.\n\nQ:  At what point in all of this did you start to keep notes?  Your memory is extraordinary or else you began to keep some kind of notes or journals about what you were eating or what you were observing in life.\n\nFussell:  I didn’t do that until we—I mean, I wish I had.  No, I didn’t keep notes of any kind except little scraps of paper if somebody sent me an idea for something.  Until when?  I don’t think it was until we went to France, and I saw how serious, how serious the subject was.\n\nQ:  The reason that made me think of it at that point in my reading was, when you mentioned one of the restaurant meals and said your notes from that meal say X, Y, or Z, and that’s when I wondered at what point you made any kind of systematic—\n\nFussell:  Not until we got to France and were eating in our first really good restaurants.\n\nQ:  And what do you think made you take notes?\n\nFussell:  The discovery of food in France.  That has been described by many people many times, and for the same reasons, that it was such a totally different culture and the key to that culture was food, and whew, what a strange idea.  Everything about it was exotic.  Like landing on Mars and saying, “Gee, well, you know, I’d better remember each step of the way here.”\n\nQ:  Was that something the two of you could talk about?\n\nFussell:  Yes.  Yeah, this is something that we could share, because Paul is the one who had wanted to go—I just wanted to go to Europe, I didn’t care where.  Paul was the one who wanted to go to France because he had been in the infantry in Alsace.  So he wanted to return to that landscape and to his memories.  Again, it was the same sort of incredible revelation that he had had about a country that existed, it’s so different from Pasadena, California.  But he had never had time to eat, of course, as a soldier, so this was a wonderful glue for the both of us, and discovering what Europe was all about.\n\nQ:  At that point did you have children?\n\nFussell:  We had children late and partly because we were not only discovering male-female, but we were discovering the world at large for the first time.  We were both very—even though Paul had been in the war, he was still a very protected parochial boy.\n\nQ:  So the first times that you would have been a faculty wife, then, you were a faculty wife without children.\n\nFussell:  Right.  Didn’t have children until I was twenty-eight.  I was married at twenty-one.\n\nQ:  And the first European trips would have been—\n\nFussell:  It would have been the year after—let’s see, did Paul get his Ph.D.?  No, this would be in the summer.  I think the summer of ’51.  It was so soon after the war that—of course, we went to England, because England was the motherlode for all Ph.D. candidates in English.  It was still so badly bombed.  So we took the grand tour the first summer we actually got to go.\n\nQ:  Just the two of you?\n\nFussell:  Yeah.  And went everywhere by train and bus.  Germany was so badly bombed, France slightly less of it.  The signs of war were everywhere.  It was like movie time, traveling through a movie.  And there was no food, except the French just couldn’t disguise that there was food.  No place else had food.  It was slim pickings for Europe.  I mean, England really had terrible food, really awful.\n\nQ:  Now, I couldn’t tell from your Kitchen Wars how many times you went to Europe.  It seemed like a lot, but I wasn’t—\n\nFussell:  It was a lot, and I’d have a hard time giving you an exact number, because we traveled throughout the fifties, the sixties, and the seventies, summer vacations, a couple of times a full year, and a summer spent home instead of Europe was considered the summer lost.  So it was heavy travel.\n\nQ:  I guess you noted that in 1965, near Nice, that’s when you were studying the French gastronomical literature.  So by that point, first of all, you were curious about French gastronomical literature.\n\nFussell:  We traveled through France a lot.\n\nQ:  I guess what I’m wondering about is what were the steps that led to considering studying French gastronomical literature a legitimate object of study.\n\nFussell:  Not until I had written some travel pieces that were very involved in food.  So I was trying to find a practical outlet for this intensely wonderful experience we kept having with food.\n\nQ:  You mean it was the travel pieces?\n\nFussell:  Well, first the travel pieces and then, hey, France has a huge literature on food itself, and that was when we had the year in Nice, so I had time to do that instead of running around.  But by that time I was getting inside the French food system and getting fascinated by that, and because we were there, you could contact a local baker, butcher, etc., etc., they were all there and happy to talk because they loved Americans at that moment.\n\nQ:  Again, by that point would you have been—so that was 1965, did I say—cooking seriously yourself?\n\nFussell:  Yes and no.  We had a bonne à tous fait who did the cooking in the house.\n\nQ:  You mean in France?\n\nFussell:  Right, right, for the year we spent in Segny.  However, she had days off, and if we gave a party, I would do the cooking, but of course I learned a very great deal from her.\n\nQ:  So that prior to that in the United States, prior to that year, how seriously had you been cooking?  Actually that’s not really what I mean.  At what point did you think, this is really a legitimate subject to think about, to research, to get involved in?\n\nFussell:  That’s a slow evolution, because the first trip to France, which I remember as having real butter and real bread, the first taste of, okay, everything we experienced we knew we couldn’t duplicate in the States; it wasn’t there.  So there’s no question of applying it.  You just said, “Oh, got to get back here.”  Nor was there any reason—you wanted to learn more about it because it was so good.  What made it so good?  But you weren’t going to try to export that back home.  So the first experience was of the total divisiveness of food cultures.  Whoa, where has this been all my life?  So only as travel became more accessible and our lives became more accustomed to going back and forth, you’d say, “Well, now, if I were making that at home, what would I make it out of since we cannot get,” (a) ripe tomatoes, we cannot get any mâche, we cannot get any of the ingredients for soupe de poisson, etc., etc.  No, that was a very slow time.\n\tBut meanwhile, that was a time to discover other people, like Elizabeth David, who I discovered sometime in the fifties.  She was the first writer I’d ever heard of who wasn’t just a little snobby kind of thing like the guys who called themselves gourmets, like men’s magazines.\n\nQ:  Would you have read Elizabeth David in France or in the United States?\n\nFussell:  In England.  Would have found her in England first.  Had never heard of M.F.K. Fisher at that time, but then I didn’t read magazines, so I wouldn’t have found her in Gourmet or Vogue or anything, because I didn’t read anything like that.\n\nQ:  Again, let’s go back to the year in 1965.  By that time, professionally how established were you in terms of your teaching or that sort of thing?\n\nFussell:  1965.  Let me think.  Okay, I had taught a couple of years at Connecticut College, but my teaching was always very, very ancillary to Paul and his schedule.  In order to have a year off, his schedule would dominate everything, so I stopped teaching.  Because we both loved travel a lot, I was trying to do more and more travel writing and find out how you did that, and food seemed to be the way.  So I would try to, wherever we were, try to look for food stories and find out how to shop them.\nBy the time we hit Nice, I really wanted to write a book about French food.  By that time, of course, Julia [Child]’s Mastering had come out, but because I had worked at Knopf, I sent a query to my former boss—I worked for the production manager, Sidney Jacobs, and said, “Here we are in France and we’re having this wonderful experience and there’s so much information here, all this wonderful stuff.”\n\tHe said, “Well, write me a little proposal and I’ll give it to Judith Jones,” and he did.\nJudith Jones said, “We have a book on French cooking.  We don’t need anything else.”\n\nQ:  What was your proposal about?\n\nFussell:  It was about interviewing the baker, interviewing—it was a reporter’s kind of interviewing each of the wonderful food producers, because they were all there right at your fingertips.  You could go to the market and talk to them and very much local to this area, and also because it was the opening of the Escoffier Museum.  So I found some of the old chefs who had worked for him, Chef Donon.  It was just a very nice coming together for an American.\n\nQ:  Did you write a travel piece about that, the opening of the—\n\nFussell:  I didn’t because, cruelly, I missed the date, I misread the invitation.  And I’m not sure where I could have published it at that time, but I intended to go to the opening and write it up and see if I could get it somewhere, and I was a day late.  It was a terrible moment.\n\nQ:  I bet it was.\n\nFussell:  And it’s just down the road, just down the road a piece.\n\nQ:  Where would that have been, the Escoffier Museum?\n\nFussell:  It’s on the Loubet River, which pours into the Mediterranean.  It’s just twenty-five miles west of Nice.  It’s just right there.  I can’t think of the exact name.\n\nQ:  Do we have time, from your point of view, to talk a little bit about the competitive cooking in Princeton?\n\nFussell:  Sure.\n\nQ:  First of all, when did you move to Princeton?\n\nFussell:  I’m so bad on dates.  I try to keep them straight.  It was about this time, so I have a feeling maybe we moved in—we’re talking about 1965 in Nice?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFussell:  If so, we lived in Princeton, I think, in 1964.  We moved the year before, spent a summer there or a summer in Cambridge.  We immediately rented the house and spent the next year in France, so that’s why I’m bad on this.\n\nQ:  Rented the house in Princeton and you spent the next—\n\nFussell:  And immediately moved to France for a year.  I mean, it’s the way the timing came up, because Paul had every third year off.  That was not an ideal way to do it, but you could rent a house for a full year to people.  You know, that worked okay.  So I didn’t get launched, let’s say, in person until after we returned, let’s say 1966.  These are always academic years.\n\nQ:  Then I think actually with that in mind, let us, in fact, stop and resume with that.\n\nFussell:  Okay.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFussell – 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Betty Fussell     \t\t\t\t\t\t          Session #2\n\nInterviewer:  Judy Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t\t     New York City\n\nDate:  March 24, 2009\n\nQ:  This is Judy Weinraub.  I’m sitting with Betty Fussell, it’s March 24th, and we are about to begin our second session.\n\tGood morning, Betty.\n\nFussell:  Good morning, Judy.\n\nQ:  We were about to talk about the competitive cooking that you experienced as a faculty wife, I guess.  Why don’t you tell me about that.\n\nFussell:  Not only experienced, but participated in fully and enthusiastically.  So there were two places for women to compete; one was on the tennis court in this nice suburb, and the other was in the kitchen.  You could not compete academically because at that point females were not let in.  It’s hard to remember that there were only two graduate schools in the East Coast, in the Ivy League, who let in women into the graduate school.  Yale was the first one, and that was not until 1960s.\n\nQ:  What was the second school?\n\nFussell:  The second school would have been Harvard.  Princeton had to be sued by the government before it let any women of any kind into its faculty.  Then that hard part for me was to have applied at one point having the rank of M.A. and applying to Princeton to become a graduate student, and Carlos Baker saying, “We have not now and have never had a woman graduate school.  That maybe our loss, but on the other hand, that’s certainly our policy.”  Wow, okay, that made things very clear.  Nor could we get a job being a faculty, nor could we get a job on the same faculty if our husband was teaching, you know, okay.\nSo okay, so what are you going to do?  Where are you going to put the academic smarts, which is all you’ve had time to accumulate?  Where are you going to put them?  Have a baby.  There are no jobs for you.\n\nQ:  So the cooking would have started while you were still in Cambridge?\n\nFussell:  The cooking competitively wouldn’t have started.  Cooking in Cambridge was just surviving as graduate students on no money and trying to find out how you do that, how you make anything.  We were at Connecticut College before we got to Princeton.  Cooking at Connecticut College was not competitive because that was a women’s college.  The competition was totally fierce, but it was the only place in the country where these high-powered women could get jobs.  Rosemond Tuve, my god, the most extraordinary scholar I will ever know, and she was in this little rinky-dink college.  She should have been at Harvard, Yale, or Princeton.  Finally, they hired her at Princeton a couple of years before she died.  This is everywhere, so there had never been women in the English departments across the nation except at a very few state universities.\n\nQ:  But Paul was at Connecticut College for how long?\n\nFussell:  That was his first job, so four years.\n\nQ:  Then what we talked about the other day was that you moved to Princeton, then you went to Europe for a year, then you came back.\n\nFussell:  Well, we moved to New Brunswick [New Jersey] first, because the job was at Rutgers, and that mattered.  Everything matters, you know.\n\nQ:  Take me from that point.  You moved to your Princeton house, then went to Europe, then came back?\n\nFussell:  More importantly, we spent a year in Europe, after moving to the outskirts of New Brunswick, on a Fulbright.  Moved to Middlebush [New Jersey] outside the absolutely godforsaken gone-to-pot town, at that point, of New Brunswick, and by that time we had a baby.  So we went off to Heidelberg for a year on a Fulbright.  That was important food-wise, because we had glorious food in Germany.  We had terrible food in England in roughly the same period, and it was much worse off, actually, than Germany, because Germany, they still had a lot of farms around, they had a lot of potatoes, so the cities suffered.  But they had a tradition of cooking that was still there, that, let’s say, places like London did not have, that they had lost in the process.  So we were exposed to some really good food, and that was interesting, learned how to cook that.\nCame back to America after that year, had two more years in the New Brunswick area because we were trying to find a place to live.  Piscataway Township, we ended up there.  Had the second baby en route.  Then the kids are getting older, there are no schools.  We’re in this weird sort of—it’s not even a suburb, it’s a no-land.  And because I am wanting to act, I want a community theater around.  I’d already started to do that when we lived in Middlebush.  So I made the push to get a little house in Princeton.  So that’s why we moved there.  We moved there for schools and essentially for me to have a community theater of some kind.  That didn’t have anything to do with food.\n\nQ:  But at least as you’ve described it in My Kitchen Wars, then you were in Europe for another year?\n\nFussell:  That’s later.  So we’re back and forth about every three years.  So the year after we moved to Princeton, we go over to France for a year.  Right.  Then during that year we can really solidify food.  Food.  Food becomes important then, at last.\n\nQ:  To you.\n\nFussell:  To me, by moving to France and being in the heart of it, in great and glorious and wonderful Nice, the Riviera.\n\nQ:  Was it exciting?\n\nFussell:  Enormously.  Enormously, because everything was so different, completely different, because the culture was so different, and because the culture was centered on food, so it was the quickest way into that culture.  There was a lot about the French culture I didn’t like.  Hated their arrogance, xenophobia, etc., etc.\n\nQ:  But it must have been so different from anything you’d ever experienced before, a culture based on food and the ability to take pleasure.\n\nFussell:  Pleasure of, meaning of.  Meaning?  Ooh, serious.  How could you be serious about something that was just about the body?  Oh, different attitude.  Oh.  Very exciting that.  Very exciting.  What so thrilled me was to go to markets, because they had a great market in Nice, two of them, two or three days a week, and because Nice is a port city  for all kinds of races and kinds and half Italian, always, and at that point fully Algerian, so we have a great, great variety.  As a port city, it always has that kind of mix.  And to be able to go from the market, to see this beautiful stuff and the way they handled it, oh, and the way they treated you, every transaction was about the perfection of the moules that day.  I mean, what a thrill.  Imagine.\n\nQ:  How did that affect your cooking?  You had some help at that point?\n\nFussell:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Thank God, because I wouldn’t know how to cook this stuff.  I had no idea.  Soupe de poisson became our favorite because that was all those fishy things that I’d never seen before, let alone known the name of.  We had a bonne à tous fait  who did all the cooking.  She would do all the shopping, but I would beg her to let me go shopping with her.  But she handled the purse.  She would ask for a certain amount of money, which I would give her, and she would do all the transactions, of course, because if it were me, it would cost twenty times as much, as she assured me constantly.  So I learned the ropes through her.\n\nQ:  How different was the food then that you ate there from what you had been used to eating in New Jersey?\n\nFussell:  Totally.  Totally.  Totally.  This is the 1960s.  We didn’t have any bread.  We still didn’t have any butter.  We certainly didn’t have good garden vegetables.  None of that had begun.  This was really still, in my view, post-war and the push to the suburbs and the first thing they did was not to put in a wonderful vegetable and herb garden.\n\nQ:  Did you try and make some of the things that she made for you?\n\nFussell:  Oh yes, yes.  Yes, I tried to make everything.\n\nQ:  How did you do that?\n\nFussell:  The children were at a little private school that was walkable to, and they had a two-hour lunch hour every day and were required to clean their plates.  They were beaten on the head if they didn’t clean up, and so they had to have their four-course meal.  So they had the big meal at noon, and then at night they had a soup that Madou had prepared, which is essentially a vegetable puree with a little butter in it.  That was a kind of standard.  But while they were at school, Madou would cook lunch for my husband and me in the garden.  Oh, imagine.  We would have absolutely glorious—you have to have three courses, because otherwise it’s not a meal, according to her.  And Nice, because of the weather, because it’s that southern belt, everything closes down for two hours and some for four.  Everything closed.\n\nQ:  How did Paul respond to those lunches?\n\nFussell:  He loved them.  He was being waited on.  It fit his routine perfectly.  He wrote in the morning.  He could take a nap after lunch.  Perfect.  Absolutely excellent as a daily routine.\n\nQ:  During that time how much better a cook did you become?\n\nFussell:  A lot because I learned so much.\n\nQ:  Tell me about some of the things you learned.\n\nFussell:  I learned how to use equipment, like the chinoises and bain-maries.  I learned all the kitchen equipment that I had never heard of before.  Because we went to England so much, constantly, I went to Elizabeth David’s shop, met her.  Still have some of the beautiful pots she sold there.  So all those things came together.  When I saw her, I said, “Oh, you know what I want to do?  I want to write a book about Escoffier.”\n\tShe raised her high eyebrows and said, “That’s a big subject.”  [laughs]\n\tI didn’t know, I’m just full of enthusiasm.  I had no idea what I was saying to the queen of English cooking.  But she was extremely warm and wonderful, generous, and let me into the big wine society, the Food and Wine Society Library there, where I got to see for the first time—ooh, look at all these books.  So other cultures, even England, understands something that we don’t understand at all, and has an enormous library.\n\nQ:  Actually, I’m interested in the Escoffier, too.  Did you think of it as a historical subject?  How did you imagine a book like that?\n\nFussell:  Well, he was, at that point, living history, because he had trained all these chefs who were still around, and many of them down there.  So as I think I said last time, I talked to a number of them and got interviews from them, [Chef] Joseph Donon and some other old boys.  They were wonderful.\n\nQ:  I guess what I’m wondering about is, if you thought of the book in somewhat academic terms or in food terms, or had you thought that through? \n\nFussell:  I thought of it as a biography, yes.\n\nQ:  So you were there for a year, but with trips to London and other parts of—\n\nFussell:  And Greece.  Yes, we were going back and forth.  There was another culture with a totally different food scheme which was wonderful, because that constituted then the peasant side of this.  So you can get this full range.  England was still kind of pub food or people’s houses food, which some of which was terrific.  Ah, so you got that experience.  You got the professional food of France and you got the peasant food of Greece.  That was a great combination.\n\nQ:  So by the time you came back, you had totally different expectations about the kitchen, presumably.\n\nFussell:  And my role and what I wanted to do with it, right.\n\nQ:  How did you see that?\n\nFussell:  Well, when I was in France, because I had all this time, the kids are off to school all day, and I began to explore the local library, which was excellent, and read a lot of nineteenth century French gastronomic literature, and much more importantly, because it’s small scale, I would run around and talk to the baker, the butcher, the fish monger.  I saw all these guys.  The only problem was my French was so bad I was always just struggling away and struggling.  The three stars were just coming up, the Turks, the chefs.  So we went off to Paul Bocuse before he’d been heard of.\nI was writing for a little army magazine called Off Duty.  I think that was its name.  So I’d have an excuse, I could come in with credentials and say, “I want to interview the chef,” because he hadn’t been interviewed.  They were delighted.\nTo my everlasting regret, Paul Bocuse said, “Ah, come and cook in my kitchen for a week.”\nAnd I looked at Paul, and saw in Paul’s eyes, “Are you kidding?”  So I didn’t do that, but I could have.\n\nQ:  What did those raised eyes mean?\n\nFussell:  Are you out of your mind?  They meant, “Who’s going to take care of the kids?”  That’s very simple.\n\nQ:  As opposed to why would you want to work so hard in somebody else’s kitchen?\n\nFussell:  No, it was just what’s going to happen to me?  I would have learned a lot.  But that’s all right, I learned a lot anyway, because all these guys would take you behind the scenes, and they would tell you who their vegetable farmers were and then you could go look at their vegetable farmers.  At that point, I wanted to do a book about—oh, I wanted to do a book about this.  So I wrote my old boss, Sidney Jacobs, at Knopf, and said, “What do you think about this?”\n\tHe said, “Well, I’ll pass it by Judith Jones.”\n\tAnd Judith Jones said, “We have Julia [Child].  We don’t need a book.  There’s no interest in France at the moment other than Julia.”\n\nQ:  But it’s interesting that you wanted to do a book.  Was that an academic urge or an urge to prove yourself through writing or what?\n\nFussell:  It was not academic; it was a way to get out of the academy.  I mean, I hated the academic modes of writing.  I was really always rebellious against that.  I always wanted a different kind of audience because I thought academic jargon was intolerable, and when you had a subject like food, the one thing you do not want to do is to academicize it, in my view.  And because I was doing the travel writing then and had written a piece about the birds of Brest for Holiday, so I had already found a way in which to write about what we were doing in the food way, and that is going to the source and finding who were doing these things.\n\nQ:  How comfortable did you feel with that as something that you wanted to do as opposed to the kind of thing Paul was doing?\n\nFussell:  Oh, wonderful, because that kept—ah.  Before I was writing in—\n\nQ:  You mean it kept it separate?\n\nFussell:  Kept it separate.  I was writing academic articles, critical articles.  He always saw that as competition, and therefore I think he was extremely hostile to it.  I understand that.  And I didn’t even want to do that.  I was always trying to find a place that was not stepping on his toes.\n\nQ:  Okay.  So you come back to the United States, he’s teaching, and how do you find your place?\n\nFussell:  So when we’re back, now we create a Provençal kitchen at Princeton, step number one toward producing this gorgeous food.  A big thing, Paul approved it because it was professional, anything professional.  He hated the idea of anything being amateurish, but the moment you had a professional stove in there, then there was some respect.\n\nQ:  I was wondering why it was professional.\n\nFussell:  It was a man’s thing.  I mean, he never touched the stove, but it was a—you know.  So he set up the wine stuff to look like—he had the home bar, to look like a real bar with the glass shelves and lights behind, you know.  So we got tons of professional equipment from Dehillerin in Paris and from Bridge Company here, and all this fit with the Julia sense of get the equipment right.\n\nQ:  How did that compare to the cooking of other faculty couples that you encountered?\n\nFussell:  Other faculty couples were doing similar things, I think not quite as obsessively as we.  We were kind of the leader of the pack of this.  Now, a lot of people knew a lot more about food than I did and about daily cooking, but we were kind of bringing in the French glitz to it because we’d spent this time there and because we had the enthusiasm for it and, by that time, quite a bit of knowledge.\n\nQ:  How did you experience each other’s cooking, through dinner parties or—\n\nFussell:  Dinner parties.  Now, this is Cheever territory.  Dinner parties were essentially drinking parties, but they were disguised as dinner parties.  I do remember, because it was ludicrous, ludicrous, as I look back.  You would show off for dinner parties and do things that you would not conceive of doing for yourselves, so everything was always an experiment.  I remember making a pheasant salmi for Philip Roth and his wife.\n\nQ:  Pretty impressive.\n\nFussell:  Well, it would be if you knew what you were doing.  Two other faculty couples came.  The whole point was to have some great coup de theâtre, which nobody had had, and you could do it in your own kitchen.  So this is always very dramatic and theatrical.\n\nQ:  How did that play out with the other couples?\n\nFussell:  The couples that we were friendly with were all striving to do the same thing.  Now, the difference, Princeton had always been a drinking town and they had very few restaurants because of the club system and because the whole town is a series of private clubs socially.  A lot of those would have cooks because there are very rich people who live there.  So this kind of mix, you go to the Yankee Tavern and it’s not about food; you go there and see the boys and their wives and have good drinks.  People really drank their way from place to place.  It was a ritual.  Everyone had a ritual hangover the next day.  It was really a post-war binge that extended a long time, because it fit into other things that were happening in America that interested me a lot.\n\nQ:  Whom did you talk with about your interest in food, or did you?\n\nFussell:  Yeah, sure, a lot.  Everybody, everybody wanted to talk about a recipe, and there are a lot of intellectual gals who were having babies and this was one way to talk seriously about something that was not politics, nor was it about diapers.  It was a kind of in-between place where you could locate yourself.  The competitive cooking came mostly on big cocktail parties which would get more and more elaborate on what was served for the buffet.\n\nQ:  Not dinner parties?\n\nFussell:  Well, dinner parties also, but you took care of a lot more people at cocktail parties; therefore, you could serve a lot more people.  But there would be buffets for two hundred people.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nFussell:  These are Gatsby show-off parties.\n\nQ:  Could you describe how you set up, how you planned the meal, how you managed something like that?\n\nFussell:  You spent a lot of time and, I think I say in some book, it’s a cheat to have—anybody could hire a caterer.  I mean, we wouldn’t because we were always too cheap and that wasn’t our tradition, but it became unfashionable to do a caterer.  You’re supposed to do it all at home.  That was part of the competitive sport.\n\nQ:  Presumably it would have been expensive, as well.\n\nFussell:  The caterer?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFussell:  And that’s why it didn’t count, because that was just money.  So what you were trying to do is to prove that you had a skill and a kind of secret skill that other people wouldn’t know to the same degree that you did.\n\nQ:  So you’re planning a dinner party.  Then do you think through the menu?  Do you wonder where on earth you’re going to get the ingredients?\n\nFussell:  Fancy the menu.  You plan the menu for a month.\n\nQ:  Describe that.\n\nFussell:  You plan the menu a long time ahead and the menu depends—this is because we’re in Princeton, that’s a problem because of shopping.  When we first came, there were two butcher shops, actual butcher shops.  They disappeared quite quickly.  The first shopping center came out and a Safeway that you had to drive to in a nearby mall, etc.  So this was all in transition.  So you could get a lot of things that you couldn’t before.  On the other hand, you were losing a lot of things all the time and you knew that.  So you would do some shopping in New York and lug it back.  The cheese store came in, so that was okay for a while.  I mean, cheese was new.  Good cheese, that was exciting.  There was still no bread.  I never did much baking of bread because the timing of it was wrong.  It took too much time in the wrong way.  The rhythm of it was wrong.\n\nQ:  Presumably it would have meant a huge amount of work just before you actually got ready for a party.\n\nFussell:  Well, it really had more to do with children, picking up children at school.  Finding a place in the kitchen that wasn’t subject to draft, that was hard.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  You took this seriously.\n\nFussell:  Yeah.  But I did know a guy who would have baked then, he was an academic, he had baked in the navy, so he would give us some of his excellent whole wheat loaves.  So this was happening, but it was an anomaly.\n\nQ:  How many different dishes might you have prepared for something like that?\n\nFussell:  Easily twenty-five to thirty, and you were trying to make as lavish a spread as interesting as possible, so you’d set up the table and have dishes that you hoped nobody had ever heard of, and a whole lot of them.\n\nQ:  You had a lot of space?\n\nFussell:  We had a lot of space, our whole downstairs, which had kind of two living rooms and the huge kitchen.  It all became one big party room, in effect.\n\nQ:  Was it expensive to produce something like this on an academic salary?\n\nFussell:  I never kept track of food because I was given my housekeeping money, you know.\n\nQ:  No kidding.\n\nFussell:  The big expense was liquor, not food.  The liquor bills must have been enormous.  Food, if you’re doing it yourself, if you’re not counting labor and you’re not doing caviar and you’re not doing—you know, we couldn’t get foie gras, so we weren’t doing the most expensive thing.  The biggest cost was labor, which was free.\n\nQ:  Would there have been a celebratory event or what would the reason have been?\n\nFussell:  You would make a celebratory event.  Everything became an event.  Fourth of July, Christmas, pre-Christmas, post-Christmas, New Year’s, birthdays, football.  Anything became an occasion.\n\nQ:  How many years were you there?\n\nFussell:  In Princeton, about twenty-six.\n\nQ:  Twenty-six years.  My goodness.\n\nFussell:  I think.  Maybe it wasn’t that long.  Sixty, ’70, ’80, well, yeah, about twenty, maybe twenty.\n\nQ:  Did your cooking change much over those years?  And how did it change?\n\nFussell:  It changed as I grew more and more tired.  [laughs]  It changed to fatigue.  Also fatigue with the whole set up of having that kind of—I want to be careful here because I was going to say that kind of ephemera, because it all disappears.  But that was certainly a part of it.  I wanted something that lasted beyond the moment.\n\nQ:  Like what?\n\nFussell:  A book, a play.  It all suited me because it was a dramatic performance and performance is the nature of now, you’re capitalizing on now, and I believe in that, I still believe in that.  On the other hand, you have a play script that can endure.  Shakespeare endures even though the performance is—\n\nQ:  Wait.  Tell me what you mean by capitalizing on the moment and still believing in that.\n\nFussell:  Because every meal is like a mantra that you wipe out by consuming it.  So for the moment only, that’s what its function is.  That’s its value.  You transform it the moment it’s off the plate and in your body, but the moment is all, the presentation, the ingesting, and everything that goes with that, the talking, the feedings it creates, etc., but then it’s gone.\n\nQ:  Whom did you talk with about thinking about things like that?  It would seem like one would need peers, colleagues, people interested in the same approach, or not, I’m not sure.\n\nFussell:  I don’t know how much I talked about it.  I think I found this mostly through books.  I think books were my conversation.\n\nQ:  And Paul wasn’t particularly interested?\n\nFussell:  I think Paul went along with all of this because it was dramatically terrific and he loved parties, and it was a public performance and he got credit by throwing these wonderful parties.  I think he truly did not care anything about the food.  So he wasn’t talking about the food in the same way, ever.  He was always terrified of being fat because he’d been a fat child, and he had a tendency to fat and this was his lifelong terror.  So the moment it was not party food, he was eating raw carrots and celery and two boxes of Twinkies.  So he was one of those compulsive eaters of a kind that his mother was, really.  She was a diabetic.\n\nQ:  How did you feed your kids?  Were you very concerned about that or what?\n\nFussell:  I was not concerned like the way parents are today, God knows.  But I knew they were getting plenty of good food.  It never worried me.  The baby food did at the beginning, because that’s what we had, little jars.  You had no idea what any of it was.  You’d taste it and say, “Well, that tastes okay.”  But I wasn’t about to sit down and make two weeks’ worth of applesauce in the blender.  I wasn’t going to make it myself because I couldn’t make it in quantities enough.  So there was zero fussing on the food, and I really also hated people who fussed about food, including kids.  So I had the daughter who ate everything and the son who ate nothing.\n\nQ:  What do you mean people who fussed about food?\n\nFussell:  Mothers who fuss over their kids’ eating, whether they take the stern stand or they, “Just one little bite.”  No, no, no.  It’s food.\n\nQ:  Did the meals reflect what was going on in food world around you?\n\nFussell:  Not for the children, because it was strictly—it was a hangover of the gender divisions.  In my family, unfortunately, there was a huge child-adult division which my husband picked up from the English tradition.  He wanted the kids shipped off to school, boarding school, at twelve, you know.  Thank God that tradition didn’t take hold in the United States and it certainly didn’t take hold in mine, but he had zero interest in that kind of thing.\n\nQ:  So meanwhile, professionally what were you trying to do?\n\nFussell:  In the mid-sixties I was trying to combine things that were not easily combinable.  So I was teaching Shakespeare at Douglass College. I was still being in the plays in the community theater; I was trying to throw the best parties in Princeton; and I was trying to get the kids to and from school and fed in between ballet and soccer, fed adequately, however we define that.  They were not eating our party food because the parties wouldn’t begin until too late.\n\nQ:  You were also trying to write articles?\n\nFussell:  Yeah, because that’s part of the territory of teaching.  Let’s see.  Was I writing?  Yeah, yeah, it was the sixties, so I was writing in between whenever I could, trying to write travel articles, trying to write food articles more and more.\n\nQ:  When did the Mabel Normand idea come along?\n\nFussell:  By this time I was doing a thesis at Rutgers for a Ph.D., and because I’m a major in dramatic literature and historically the Renaissance, so Shakespeare, Johnson and Lyly were my boys put together in tragic-comedy because I think tragic comedy is essentially the English form.  Okay.  What does that have to do with anything?  What was your question?  It was supposed to lead back to that.\n\nQ:  As long as we’re here, though, how much did you get into the Ph.D.?\n\nFussell:  Oh, I finished it.\n\nQ:  You did finish it?\n\nFussell:  I finished it, but I was teaching at the same time at Rutgers at that point, so I was always trying to combine too many things.  So the teaching delayed it for a couple of years because I didn’t have time to finish it, but I got it done.  I got it done within a couple of years.\n\nQ:  The idea for Mabel Normand came along after you finished the Ph.D.?\n\nFussell:  It probably came right after it, but it came out of my complete fascination with theater and my complete fascination with American traditions, and those two things combined in somebody like Mabel, who is the bridge between vaudeville, where she never appeared, and silent movies.\n\nQ:  It was, however, a very nonacademic subject.\n\nFussell:  That helped.\n\nQ:  Talk to me about that.  Was there a decision to stop doing academic things and move to a different kind of writing?\n\nFussell:  I think I was always looking for a way to move away from the academy and to move toward nonacademic general audience popular culture.  Movies helped and theater helped.  So Mabel was the perfect person.  I could do a biography.  There was history involved; I knew how to do that.  But I was wrong.  There is no history in movies.  I didn’t know that.  Because it’s all made up, so there are no documents, however.\n\nQ:  I guess what I’m getting at, though, is, so it’s a very nonacademic subject, although certainly the research has to be done in a serious way.  It’s not a food subject.  It just interested me as a first book as perhaps less daunting than some other things.\n\nFussell:  Like what?\n\nQ:  Well, less daunting than a serious academic subject.  In a funny way less daunting than throwing yourself into food.  It struck me as a subject you would have felt comfortable with.\n\nFussell:  Absolutely.  Right.  But daunting is not—I mean, that wouldn’t have been the feeling.  The feeling would be, I mean, why write about food?  That’s not important enough.\n\nQ:  Talk about that a little bit.\n\nFussell:  Whereas theater is already sanctioned, books about movies, my god, movie history was very, very sanctioned.  So that, for me, was a natural positioning.  Food is an entirely different thing.  Food was—I mean, there are all these recipe books in this country, and I’m not talking about England or France or Germany, but in this country there wasn’t any food literature, so there was nothing.  I didn’t want to write cookbooks like Julia.  I mean, all they were were cookbooks, essentially, or there was the snobby literature that, you know, toss that aside.\n\nQ:  Like what?\n\nFussell:  Like Lucius Bebe.  The gastronomes.  All right, we don’t pay any attention to that.\n\nQ:  So Mabel Normand you finished in 1982.  Masters of American Cookery, the date is 1983.\n\nFussell:  Right, but that’s because that’s the way the time lags, and the Masters of American Cookery was really an accident, the reason for getting into that, because Moira Hodgson, we’d been both writing for the Times at that point and our paths crossed and we knew each other had friends, mutual friends, from Princeton, anyway.\n\nQ:  Writing food pieces for the Times?\n\nFussell:  Yes, Moira took over the food job for a terrible year for herself, and I took over the New Jersey restaurant reviewing for a terrible year for myself.  That was craziness in New Jersey, just craziness.  Mimi Sheraton was running the thing when Moira left.\n\nQ:  Did you think of those reviews as less serious or just a way to get into newspapers or a way to eat without having to pay the costs or what?\n\nFussell:  All of those.  All of those.  All of those.  My husband would say, “How cute.”  Ooh.  And he wouldn’t go with me to restaurants.  Ooh, I really didn’t like that.  I really didn’t like that.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Well, it means you really have to sign up other people to go with you, certainly.\n\nFussell:  Yes, you do, and I signed up some wonderful—Carlos Fuentes.  I mean, I had a whole lot of celebrities, if those poor guys out at Asbury Park only knew.\n\nQ:  Masters of American Cooking is interesting because it seems like a combination of history and cookbook.\n\nFussell:  Right.  Now, this is why it was—back to Moira, who had gone to—we were talking and she said, “Oh, I just signed a book for Times Books,” which I’d never heard of.  I hadn’t realized that’s Craig Claiborne, etc. at that point.  She said, “Why don’t you give them a proposal, Betty.”\n\tI thought, “Okay.  Tell me what to say.”\n\tSo she said, “Well, you know, just make up something,” and dah, dah.\n\tI’d never thought of doing that, but I also thought, with just total arrogance, ‘Well, gee, you know, I have been cooking now.  I’ve been cooking intensively for twenty years.  I’ve got to know something.”  How did I find out how to cook?  I certainly didn’t find out in any traditional ways.  I found out from four people, these are they, and I found out through books, and that’s how they found out a lot, through books.  So anybody can cook.  You just have to read a book.  So that seemed natural.\n\nQ:  And that was true, you feel that you really had learned how to cook from these masters?\n\nFussell:  Absolutely true.  Absolutely true.\n\nQ:  Over what period of time would that have been?\n\nFussell:  That would be during the sixties, essentially.  Sixties, yes.  But my real point was, you don’t need a recipe, you don’t need an authority.  I mean, nobody got the point because we want authorities; we want somebody to tell us what to do.  Ah, my despair.\n\nQ:  M.F.K. Fisher didn’t tell you what to do, presumably.  She was inspiring, but—\n\nFussell:  She was authoritative in a very different way than the recipe way.  She was extremely authoritative in other ways that she let you know, in a way that Julia never would.   [laughs]\n\nQ:  But about food, what kinds of ways was she authoritative?\n\nFussell:  “There’s my way, and my way’s the right way.”\n\nQ:  In terms of your own cooking, what did you get from that?\n\nFussell:  From M.F.K.?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFussell:  It’s about the moral dimension of food.\n\nQ:  The moral dimension?\n\nFussell:  The moral dimension.  You know, she’s the closest of all these people to being a poet of food.  So, symbolic, social meanings of food.  Terrific on that.  I mean, very, very good.\n\nQ:  Chronologically, I guess is what I’m saying, you must have been reading James Beard before Craig Claiborne’s books, or no?\n\nFussell:  I got James Beard’s Fireside book for my wedding, so I had an early James Beard book, and I loved that because it was so simple and because it was so American.  It was an American voice I recognized, straightforward, and it was not prissy Better Homes and Gardens, which I also got, which I never used and hated. \n\nQ:  So when would you have started using that, literally from the time you were married?\n\nFussell:  1949.  I think the Fireside is 1946.  But I really liked it because it had pictures, and I’d had the Fireside Book of Folksongs, so I liked the layout.\n\nQ:  So how would you have proceeded then in terms of preparing dishes that were—\n\nFussell:  I’d look up in the Fireside book and see if he had anything on, what, hamburger, meatloaf, boiling potatoes and mashing potatoes.  How do you do that?\n\nQ:  And you literally followed his directions and it gradually became part of your—\n\nFussell:  Well, his directions are very simple, so, yeah, and if you’re someone like me, you want to just take the basics and then say, “Oh, I’ve got this in the kitchen.  Let’s throw that in and see what happens.”  Sometimes that tastes good and sometimes that doesn’t.\n\nQ:  Craig Claiborne was after that.\n\nFussell:  Right and much more codified, much more codified.\n\nQ:  Much more codified.  How so?\n\nFussell:  Because he was doing a different kind of job.  He was bringing international cooking to America and he was translating all the time the French, the Chinese, you know, different cultures into the American mainstream pot.\n\nQ:  I found those recipes rather welcoming.  It inspired confidence that you could actually do it.\n\nFussell:  Right.\n\nQ:  How different was that from the James Beard recipes?\n\nFussell:  Well, James Beard wasn’t giving us recipes for twenty-five ingredient pâtés.  That’s what we got from Craig.  The other thing we got were things like scalloped mousse, you know, those beautiful fish mousses that you could suddenly make because there was a Cuisinart, you know.  Wow, that’s very exciting.  So you could do French things that you would never try to do with Jim.  Jim wasn’t doing those.\n\nQ:  Were you looking at the Claiborne books and Julia at the same time, more or less?\n\nFussell:  Yes.  I’m sketchy on—Julia’s 1961?  What’s her—\n\nQ:  I think so.\n\nFussell:  Is that it?  Okay.  And Craig is later.  We needed Julia for—and people like me especially, and this was what was so interesting at the time because she’s the first cookbook writer I have ever known that commanded the respect of men.  Why?  Because she has a very analytic mind, she was treating it as a professional analyzer, and she has really an engineering brain.  Okay.  So the way she organizes things and the way she lays it out and made it all very clear and detailed.  So the twenty-five pages to a single recipe made a lot of sense, because that was going to give you every single way on how to build a bridge.\n\nQ:  I was interested in your writing that she was incredibly organized.\n\nFussell:  Yeah.\n\nQ:  Is that what you mean by what you’re describing?\n\nFussell:  Yeah, and analytic.  She’s analytic.  That’s not Fannie Farmer, that’s certainly not the Good Housekeeping book, it’s not Joy of Cooking.  She’s the one who showed us the structures.\n\nQ:  Who took the recipes apart?\n\nFussell:  Who created the recipes out of—gave us the foundations, gave us the mother sauces, the idea of these being the base, the stocks.  Okay, that is your basement, this is what you build on it, this is how you relate these things, these are the variations.  Yeah, and very thorough.\n\nQ:  So by the time you thought about doing this book, you were totally comfortable with all four of them?\n\nFussell:  Yeah.  Yeah.\n\nQ:  How did you see it?  The way it reads to me, it’s an interesting combination of history and recipes and encouragement.\n\nFussell:  Well, I had wanted to just do biographies.  I wanted to make them biographies.\n\nQ:  After Mabel Normand?\n\nFussell:  Yeah.  I wanted four biographies of these.  These were such interesting people and they were all of a time, so historically they have their—you know, this is the moment of the new revolution, and so naïve that I didn’t understand that I would be hated by people like Judith Jones and others, including, as it turned out, Craig and Jim.\n\nQ:  Hated because?\n\nFussell:  Because they all thought I was trying to steal recipes.  It’s called the copyright problem, intellectual property.\n\nQ:  But if you saw it as biographies, how would that have played into it?\n\nFussell:  Because I wanted to have the biography and I wanted to have, let’s say, the ten key recipes for each.  And Times Books said, “Are you kidding?  We’re not going to pay a copyright,” and Times Books owns Claiborne, but they didn’t own the others.  They weren’t going to pay anybody.\nBut each of these people, at that time, except for Julia, Julia was the only one who got it, because Julia’s a different kind of mind and spirit, and all the rest of them, the moment they caught wind that it was not just about them and there’s no hiding it, but they each automatically assumed that it was going to be a biography about them and they were going to be starred, and, no, it was about four together.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\nQ:  So how did it morph into what it finally became?\n\nFussell:  Through the hard work of the Times editor guys.  Gee, they were a peculiar lot, you know.\n\nQ:  But you must have had some role in deciding how to do it.\n\nFussell:  Well, they said, “You can’t do it this way.  We don’t really want biographies.  We want you to use these people and then to make your own recipes.”\n\tI said, “Well, that’s what I actually do, but I was trying to honor these people.”\n\t“No, not allowed to do that.  You have to—.”\nOkay.  So I made my own the way I would if I were cooking in the kitchen, by looking at these guys and saying, “Okay, what do I want from each of those?  These are going to be the four posts of the bed.”\n\nQ:  That’s a pretty major concept, doing all of that in one book.  How long did it take you to do that?\n\nFussell:  It took one year.\n\nQ:  One year to do—\n\nFussell:  One year to do the whole thing.\n\nQ:  Oh, my word.\n\nFussell:  Because this was the year of the divorce.  Not the divorce; it was the split.  Paul had gone off to England.  I had the house.  He had left the house, in effect.  He had not left the house earlier, which was a problem, but he left the house now.  I was by myself.  I had no one.  My son was at Oxford and my daughter was working.  Okay.  I had nobody I had to take care of, except the cats.  Okay.  That meant I could work twenty-four hours a day, and did.  I cooked something in the kitchen, typed it up, went back to the kitchen, made the next thing.  It was a nicely functioning machine for a year.  It was a great way to use the kitchen at its fullest and say goodbye to it, which was important because it was a great kitchen.  I’ll never have a kitchen like that again.\n\nQ:  Once it was finished, how did you see that book?  As an achievement, as a liaison with another kind of writing, or did you even think that through?\n\nFussell:  It was the beginning of the publishing debacle that has remained, and from my point of view, for all the remaining books.  Only Mabel was a perfectly published book between the relation of author and publisher, Ticknor & Fields, and it was the last of the times when that seemed to be a perfectly wonderful relation.  You were getting what you wanted.  You said, “I want these pictures.”  You paid for them, but you got to have the layout say, and all those things mattered a lot to me.  All these guys who were the editors at Times Books, they went off to Doubleday in the middle of it.  I had this new girl who came in who said, “I want this, this, this, this, and this,” and she suddenly wanted 25 percent more recipes.  Okay, did them dutifully.  Nothing turned out the way I’d wanted on that.\n\nQ:  But nevertheless, it was a very legitimate food writing credential.\n\nFussell:  Well, it wasn’t at the time.  I was just blasted by Judith.  Blasted.  I’m friends of Judith now, but she’s probably forgotten the letter she wrote.  I haven’t.\n\nQ:  What did it say?\n\nFussell:  Each of them, I mean, M.F.K. Fisher was very snotty about it, and Craig, who had embraced me because he had found out that my husband was gay, said I was perfect.  And Jim, who was always a bitch anyway, you know, warm and a bitch, so he’s back and forth, whatever hit him.  So I felt, oh, boy, I mean, what I thought of as a food world, I thought, “I’m sure not ever going to be a part of that.”\n\nQ:  Oh, my.  Now, let’s go back for a second to the week’s class you took with Beard.  When did it fit into that context?\n\nFussell:  This is before I wrote it.\n\nQ:  Before you wrote it?\n\nFussell:  Right.\n\nQ:  You didn’t take that after you’d moved to New York?\n\nFussell:  I did, but how did it work?  Because I was writing that book in Princeton, but maybe I didn’t finish the book until after I was in Princeton.  I mean until after I moved to New York, because I also had Clancy.  I took John Clancy courses.  The reason it’s hard for me to figure this out is that I was spending time, when I was writing the Mabel book in the last two or three years of the 1970s, spending midweek in New York where I would rent.  I was renting apartments.\n\nQ:  You think that was when you took the Beard course?\n\nFussell:  That must have been it, actually.  So it was not after I fully moved to New York.  I was coming into New York and living three days a week here.  That’s when it had to be.\n\nQ:  It read as though you had talked to each of these people.\n\nFussell:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  I had interviewed M.F.K. Fisher.  I ended up interviewing her four times.  I interviewed her when I went to California on another kind of story, and I just threw her in there.\n\nQ:  So that by the time you took the class with Beard, had you interviewed him extensively, or did that come afterward?\n\nFussell:  I only interviewed him twice.  I had the class and I had one personal interview, and that was all I had personally.\n\nQ:  One personal interview of how long?\n\nFussell:  Probably an hour, hour and a half.\n\nQ:  The class was how many days?\n\nFussell:  The class was probably five days.  But I had meantime read a very great deal about him, so I felt I knew him intimately.\n\nQ:  Before you interviewed him or before you took the class?\n\nFussell:  Before I interviewed him.  Before I took the class, yes.  I mean, there was a lot that had been written about him by that time, and also because he was the kind of man who didn’t hide.\n\nQ:  I know you wrote about the class in My Kitchen Wars, but could you tell me something about the class now?  How many people were part of it?\n\nFussell:  Probably no more than twelve.  What I loved was the kitchen.  I loved the maps.  I loved the way its scope was the world.\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nFussell:  The walls and the ceiling had the world map on it, like National Geographic.  You were inside the map of the world.  That was pretty wonderful.  I liked the fact that the kitchen equipment was so dinky, yet by that time he had gotten an induction stove, a counter, and a couple of ovens.  We were all very crowded and it was all extremely hands-on, which he was very good at.  We did all the work.\n\nQ:  Hands-on meaning participatory?\n\nFussell:  We were just clustering around.  He sat on his high stool, like the great Buddha he was then, and smiled benignly and encouraged us.\n\nQ:  How were tasks assigned?\n\nFussell:  You would divide up with—we were very mixed in who we were and genders and backgrounds.  A really interesting class of people.  I mean, it was very New York.\n\nQ:  A mix of levels of experience, as well?\n\nFussell:  Yes, but nobody knew how to cook the way he did, so we all felt beginners.  A guy named Larsen, do you remember the designer Larsen?  Okay.  He was—\n\nQ:  Jack Lenor Larsen.\n\nFussell:  Right, Jack Lenor Larsen.  He and his boyfriend were part of the students.  He was kind of the most interesting because he was an extraordinary person in himself and a celebrity, but here he was cooking away.  Gael Greene came by one night, and I’d never seen her before.  I asked somebody else, “Who is that?”  She appeared like a creature from outer space.\n\tSomebody explained “Oh, that’s Gael Greene.”\n\t“Okay.” \n\tSo this is all part of the casualness of New York.  I think there was a surgeon, a housewife.  You know, it would go that way.\n\nQ:  Was there a menu?\n\nFussell:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  We’d be given the plan, the lesson plan, the menu.  We would always sit down at the end and eat what we had prepared.\n\nQ:  Were there instructions on the lesson plan?\n\nFussell:  Oh yes.  Vast.  I mean, everything was detailed.  So each recipe carefully laid out.  We would each follow the recipes.  He would follow us following the recipes to make sure we were doing—“Don’t use that garlic.  That’s brown.  That’s old.  Throw that out.”  Very careful about making sure we chose the best ingredients out of whatever we were given.\n\nQ:  He had provided the ingredients?\n\nFussell:  Yes.  Yes, yes, he provided everything.  We were providing the labor.\n\nQ:  Did he divide you into teams or how did that work?\n\nFussell:  Usually no more than three.  You’d usually work as a pair, and you’d have to constantly make room, because there was not room.  So you’d have to move out to a little porch back there or move into the other room and find a bare table you could do something on.  It was very, very crowded.\n\nQ:  Since it was a menu, it was important when each course was finished, yes?\n\nFussell:  Right.  So he had things timed out and you’d be told, “You’d better get going on that because it’s taking too long.”  So he was in perfect control without seeming to be at all.  I think he had a very good time.  He loved the adoration, we loved to adore him, and the food was primary.  I mean, we were all concentrated on making everything taste wonderful.\n\nQ:  The food meaning the ingredients as well as the way it was cooked, or what?  Yes?\n\nFussell:  Right.\n\nQ:  Who had purchased the ingredients?\n\nFussell:  Probably one of his staff.  Clay was working and, oh, two of the young boys.  I can’t remember which ones.  So, yes, it was very, in that way, professional.\n\nQ:  But said the equipment was dinky.\n\nFussell:  Well, yeah, because it was—I mean, this is not Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s restaurant kitchen; this is still a home kitchen.  As you know, chef after chef complains who has to come to the Beard House to cook.\n\nQ:  It’s not huge.\n\nFussell:  It’s not huge and doesn’t always have the salamander or the convection oven you wanted.\n\nQ:  But nevertheless, it certainly provided you with an understanding that must have been helpful in writing the book, referring to Beard in Masters of American Cooking.\n\nFussell:  Right, because I love Beard’s method of cooking, which was, in a way, the opposite of Julia’s, because Jim is much more American-oriented and he just takes his great big hand and [demonstrates] there goes the bread dough.  Or [demonstrates] and there goes the beating in of the egg whites.  Forget spatulas.\n\nQ:  The sound effects are great, but could you describe his method?\n\nFussell:  Ah, his method was in every possible way hands-on, and not nearly as—he’s much more improvised than Julia.  I mean, it’s still very well laid out, but Julia goes for the details, as we all know from the television series.  So it would be harder to cook for Julia than it was for Jim, because Julia, quite rightly, her goal was to methodologize, to make methodical what we were tending just to throw together.\n\nQ:  I wonder if you can think of a dish that you made following his kinds of instructions and a dish following her kinds of instructions and how different the results would have been.\n\nFussell:  It’s a good comparison and I’m going to have trouble thinking of any single dish we made for him.\n\nQ:  A soufflé, chicken?\n\nFussell:  We probably didn’t make soufflés.\n\nQ:  For him?\n\nFussell:  Yeah.  We would have made one for Julia.  That would be a good comparison.  The timing would be too exact for the soufflé.  We made a lot of entrées, meat entrées for Jim, to reflect, I think, his own love of hearty protein.  The choucroute garnie is a perfect James Beard, bringing whole lots of different ingredients together with a sense of abundance, display, that’s the James Beard style, strong flavors and less subtle.  Something I hadn’t thought about, I think Jim was really about bringing things together, including people.  His whole eagerness was to sit down at the table with all these people and eat together and have a good time.  That would be very different from Julia.\n\nQ:  But she would have choucroutes, as well, but it might have been—\n\nFussell:  And her choucroute, she would explain how to make this.  We’d have to make the sausages, we would have to do the sauerkraut from scratch, you know.  We would have to do each of those things from the base.  It would take us several days to make the same courcroute.  Jim would certainly do shortcuts on that.  Her flavors would be more probably authentic Alsatian.  She’d make sure that it was classically Alsatian.  Jim might be much more freewheeling in what flavors—might throw in some caraway seed.\n\nQ:  And the results in terms of how an eater would experience it?\n\nFussell:  I think with Julia there would be a lot of the same delight in the finished product.  I’m thinking about her kitchen table where she once—we had celerie rave.  No, it was celery somebody Victoire.  Okay.  I interviewed her at Cambridge and she was going to carefully record this and use this recipe, so she was always doing two things, three things at once.  Very organized in that way.  She’s not just going to give me a lunch, although I’m there for interviewing.  She made this very, very simple dish seem absolutely wonderful, but it was done exactly.  The way the celery was boiled in the chicken broth, the laying on of the anchovies, the hard cooking of the eggs, that all sounds pretty simple.\nThen we sat around the table and ate, and it was a total pleasure, but it didn’t—Jim would have wanted to make more of a show of it and he would have said, “This is my theater and I’m going to make the most of every scene.”  I think Julia let the scenes build and build and at the end of twenty years you have a play.\n\nQ:  Do you make any personal judgment about the difference in terms of how it would be for the people to whom it was served?\n\nFussell:  How each of them would feel about serving it?\n\nQ:  No, how you felt.  I mean, in the end, would their approaches make much difference to experiencing these dishes at the table?\n\nFussell:  Yes and no.  Yes because of the difference of those two people and all that reflects.  There’s just a very big difference in the person, and therefore sitting and eating with them makes a big difference.  How you eat it is different.\n\nQ:  I see.  In their company.\n\nFussell:  In their company.  Not because of how they prepared it; their company makes a difference.  Their presence is a huge ingredient in the table, in the dish.\n\nQ:  Could you compare them?  His would have been more, I don’t know, gustatory or enthusiastic or what?\n\nFussell:  His would have been more theatrical.  It’s not about the flavor of the food; it’s the ambience, it’s what’s created around it.  And that, for me, is just as important as every single thing that has gone into any particular dish, because we do not eat in vacuums.  We do not eat in labs.  So the context is everything.\n\nQ:  Let’s go back then to how that book was experienced.  First of all, how did you feel about it after the book was completed?\n\nFussell:  Bewildered.  I thought, “This is wow.”  I thought I was—I mean, I’d just gotten slapped down by the food world, I mean the food world as I knew it, in ways that completely surprised me.  This little hick from the suburb, which is what I was, and because I was also exploring ways—the Masters of American Cookery, that was just a little thing I could throw off because I’d done so much cooking.  I was interested in the cookbooks that I had in my library.  Okay, let’s throw all that in.\n\nQ:  I don’t know whether you’ve looked at it recently, but it’s really a terrific book.\n\nFussell:  Well, I think so now, but I sure didn’t know what I was doing then.  I mean, you know, you get hit in the jaw by people whom you’ve thought were your heroes, are suddenly saying, “Go away, little girl.”\n\nQ:  So how did that affect you in terms of what your next book would be?\n\nFussell:  Well, at this same time I was trying to do another movie biography.  So I thought am I would follow up Mabel by doing Jean Harlow, who I adore, or Carole Lombard, or Ingrid Bergman for a different reason.  I love the fact that she had—this is some of the time when she had been out of favor.  You know, the American public had rejected her because she had run off from her husband.  I thought, “Oh, that’s really—.”  Ah!  I investigated each of these quite thoroughly and there were a whole lot of extraneous problems for each of them.  There was a person working on the Jean Harlow who said, “You’re not going to have any of my material.  Don’t move in here.”  Very territorial again.\nI forget what happened with the Carole Lombard.  It was going to be really hard to get any documents.\nIngrid Bergman I met her daughter and I thought, “Oh, my god, they’re all so wary.  They don’t know.”  I was really very, very innocent.  “They all think I’m trying to move in and take something, take something.”  “She’s written her biography.  Why would you want to—I mean, she’s written about herself.”  Oh, boy, okay.\n\n\nQ:  This says in 1996, I Hear America Cooking.  You must have done things in between, or Eating In, as well.\n\nFussell:  Yes, but I Hear America Cooking wasn’t one that would have had a long gestation, and I think I thought because, all right, food is so much fun as a subject.  I mean, I really love—I know.  I know what it was.  Despite the knock in the head from the official food establishment as it then was, the publishing establishment in New York, what I discovered in food was how many people there were of all kinds who were interested in the subject, and this has partly to do with a moment of the food revolution.  So everybody was getting excited at the same time about something that nobody had talked about but we were all kind of involved with.  This is there’s no community like the food community.\n\nQ:  Okay.  This is the eighties and I’m trying to think where we were in the food revolution.\n\nFussell:  By the eighties, Julia is a television queen.  We’ve had the whole population change its mind about food.  Food is fun.  Food is interesting.  Food can be serious fun.  And it’s something that is very uniting, that is not politics and not religion, which is in shambles, you know.  It is a way to have a community which is back to my community theater.  It’s a way to substitute for community theater, because I was meeting all these people through writing more and more about food, and every event was a little bonding.  I loved this aspect of food.  So I thought, you know, “I’ve got to make a choice.  I can keep on pursuing the movie thing, which is so isolating and territorial, or I can move into the food world and find out where it’s not territorial and struck that right up front.  Okay, so it’s never going to be worse than that.  And why don’t I run around the country and see what people are actually eating all around the country?”\nSo that seemed to me a really good thing to do, because I wanted the community of America—this is all with the background of the Vietnam War, Cold War, all which I despised.  The Korean War made me so angry I wanted to—“How can you have a war?  We just had a war.  See what war does?  That’s bad.”  So this seemed to me a wonderful counteracting to that, that was outside the realm of the divisiveness.  In today’s context that sounds very [Barack] Obama, but it certainly wasn’t then.  So food seemed to do that, and also because I loved to travel, because I adore America as a country to travel in, and because I could travel alone.  I didn’t have anybody else to take care of.  I didn’t have the kids or the husband to shepherd.  I could just go wherever I wanted to.\n\nQ:  How did you support yourself?\n\nFussell:  By an advance and by alimony, which is crucial.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  The advance is for each book as you did them?\n\nFussell:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So Masters of American Cookery gave you the credential that would have gotten you future advances?\n\nFussell:  Yeah.  Yeah, because those four people, not Julia, but Judith and the other three, they were the only people who, you know—otherwise I got very good press on it.\n\nQ:  From the real world.\n\nFussell:  From the real world, not from that part of the territory is all.\n\nQ:  Did that make an enormous difference to you that you at least got—not at least.  To me, having the people who actually read and use the book would mean a lot.\n\nFussell:  I was always surprised and excited, but surprised.  Okay, I mean, but I always felt—I think I still feel the same way, “Yeah, well, what do you need a recipe for?  Just take a look at this.”  Because I don’t use recipes that way and I don’t expect other people to.  But people, to my astonishment, keep wanting to follow recipes.  So, okay, all right.  So for I Hear America Cooking, it was certainly never to me about the recipes, certainly never about the recipes.  It’s about everything else.  It’s what they come out of.\n\nQ:  Play that out a little bit, that’s it’s what they come out of.\n\nFussell:  It’s what they come out of.  There is no such thing as a new recipe.  That’s why the copyright just drives me crazy.  Recipes are not invented, no.  They are traditionally  a traditional mode of communication that has gone on for 40,000 years.\n\nQ:  Cooking?\n\nFussell:  Cooking.  There are only certain variations, you know.  I mean, millions and millions.  There are not infinite numbers, just new combinations.\n\nQ:  As you were doing these next books, the Eating In, I Hear America Cooking, you got to travel around the country a good bit?\n\nFussell:  Oh yeah.  That’s what it was for.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Food, revolution-wise, what was going on?  We’re talking about the mid and later eighties.\n\nFussell:  Right.  For the first time, people would open up about food because they would have opinions about it, and simultaneously that meant that in areas where there had been a traditional cuisine, pockets of cuisine, they would get rewarded for talking about what was special to them, so what I call the ports of entry where the immigrants came in.  So because of the revolution, there was also how to distinguish what’s in America as opposed to French, which has always been the battle because our vocabulary professionally is French and yet none of that has anything to do with the context of America.  So that has always been the most interesting quest for me.\n\nQ:  The context of America?\n\nFussell:  Yeah.  Yeah.\n\nQ:  Did you see all this as a revolution?\n\nFussell:  Yeah, absolutely.\n\nQ:  Could you describe that?\n\nFussell:  Well, in Masters of American Cooking I call them the leaders.\n\nQ:  No, I meant going around the country.\n\nFussell:  That just extends that.  Then you’re talking to ordinary people everywhere who are participating in this because they are for the first time more and more moving into farmers’ markets, this stuff that they may have lost before the canning revolutions of the thirties, you know, that they had in the tens and twenties.  So you find people who were now once again growing an ear of corn in their backyard that they wouldn’t have for a while.\n\nQ:  The green markets here, you presumably lived here during the time that the green markets, where it started and expanded, but at the same time, as you pointed out, they were beginning to recover around the country.  When you traveled around, did you see farmers’ markets as they grew or did you see supermarkets or—\n\nFussell:  I would look for farmers’ markets, but my real interest was in finding the ethnic roots of people and how that was expressed in food.  So it was much more of that than sustainable farming or anything else, was seeing how it grew out of these different immigrants, because I always wanted to make the point that you cannot compare America to any other nation on earth and have it accurate, because our mix is different.  No place else has this peculiar history.\n\nQ:  Peculiar in the people who make it up?  Explain that a little bit.\n\nFussell:  Peculiar in the way it happened.  You have a huge native population which you eradicate.  You do not intermarry.  The Spaniards had a huge population in Mexico that they eradicated, but they intermarried.  So you have one kind of continuity there that we don’t have.  We have people from more places in the world than any other country for the reasons that have to do with the egalitarian hopes, etc.  Those things never stopped.  They kept coming, as they do now, and so they keep mixing.  So our whole notion of what is traditional, what could be authentic, what could be those terms for cuisine don’t fit us.  We have to make up a whole new vocabulary.\n\nQ:  Now I know you would have plenty people to talk about thinking these things through, but as you were researching these books of the eighties, before Corn, did you have peers, did you have colleagues?  How did you think these things through, or did you do it by yourself?\n\nFussell:  I didn’t know anybody who was interested in the history of cookbooks until I read James Beard’s American Cookery.  Okay, that’s the first time I found anybody who valued them in anyway.  Okay.  That was wonderful and helped on the I Hear America Cooking, because when you would run into the ethnic pockets, you would find local books, you would find regional cuisine books still.  So this is just when Paul Prudhomme was getting started.  So there was a kind of discovery of it’s not really regional, but what we were calling regional cooking.  It was just beginning.  That’s part of the food revolution.  We’re beginning to discover what’s on these shores and typical of our regions and how they differ from the regionalism of anything in Europe.\n\nQ:  The regionalism of what in Europe?\n\nFussell:  Of anything in Europe, you know, where region means something different.  That means vertical history going back to the Phoenicians, at least.  Here it means horizontal history, in layers.\n\nQ:  As you were traveling around the country, how did you contact people?\n\nFussell:  Good question.  With difficulty.  Most of my time was spent trying to find really local people, and I think the best fun was in Louisiana when I got to go into Cajun country and word of mouth.  You head for Louisiana, you head for New Orleans, you find Paul Prudhomme.  Ah, what village did you come from?  What town did you come from?  “Oh, you really ought to talk to So-and-so up in Lafayette.”  So you drive up to Lafayette.  That was so much fun.\n\nQ:  How did you see the work that you were doing?  Did you see it as groundbreaking, as legitimate, as what?\n\nFussell:  I just saw it as a book about America with food as the focus and nobody else had done it quite this way yet, and I was always happy to do something that nobody else had done, or to try to.\n\nQ:  Let’s think about Corn a little bit and the gestation period of how that happened.\n\nFussell:  That really was a natural outcome of I Hear America Cooking, as I say in the book, because of having deliberately gone to the immigrant cultures, because that’s what we think of as American, as a source of American cooking, and realizing I had left out the center of it.\n\nQ:  The center of it being?\n\nFussell:  The center of it being corn in the Midwest.  So I had been all around the perimeter, and the only place I’d gone, I’d gone up to Chicago and the North, but the whole prairie lands were untouched.  Then I found out why, because I didn’t even know, that’s because it was very homogeneous and it was settled all in 1840 to 1860.\n\nQ:  The area you mean?\n\nFussell:  Yeah, the whole Midwest was very homogeneous in relation to the rest of the country.  It was Germanic, essentially Germanic.\n\nQ:  Did you have to talk people into, meaning publishers, corn as a subject?\n\nFussell:  Let me think about that.  Elizabeth Sifton was my editor at Viking for I Hear America Cooking.  We had had to buy the contract out from Times Books, because Elizabeth read it in manuscript and liked it.  And why?  Because she’s an historian.  She understood and she was also interested in American subjects.  So, okay, so she bought it.  Then she left Viking for Knopf.  So she would have bought the Corn book as saying, yes, that’s an extension of I Hear America Cooking.  It’ll tell us more about American culture.  That’s why she bought it.\n\nQ:  It was pretty daring, though, in terms of whether or not it would sell, whether or not that specificity would appeal to people.\n\nFussell:  Well, this is why I was lucky for a while.  I was lucky before she left Knopf, lucky to have Elizabeth, because she was very positive about such things.  She did not have a lowbrow commercial eye.  Whereas Nach Waxman said, “Oh, Betty, you don’t have any recipes in this.  You’re crazy.”  So there were not food books sold in this country that did not have recipes.  So I did not have the sale at the beginning that it would have if it had recipes, and it got no rewards.\n\nQ:  It did not have the sale in the beginning, but it had six editions.\n\nFussell:  Yeah, but that’s—who knows?  I wouldn’t know.\n\nQ:  So what happened between 1992 and 2004 that—six editions is a very big deal.\n\nFussell:  Because nobody had supplanted it with a book about—no one was going to bother to write another book about corn.  [laughs]  And because it covered a whole lot of bases, and because by that time—\n\nQ:  A whole lot of bases.  Play that out a bit.\n\nFussell:  Because it had a lot of Native American culture in it, which was taken seriously as our indebtedness to a tradition, and we don’t have a whole lot of books on that.  From my point of view, it tried to get at a larger subject of how we were a very scientific culture and we don’t understand mythology and symbols and art, so we discount them.  But you cannot write a book about corn and just have it about the economics.  It misses the point.  It misses the point.\n\nQ:  How would you describe the point?\n\nFussell:  The point is what is corn and why is it important and how does it define American culture, not just cuisine, culture?\n\nQ:  Looking back at that now, does it surprise you at all that it has been as successful as it has been, or does it also have something to do with how the revolution progressed?\n\nFussell:  It has to do with that.\n\nQ:  Could you explain that some?\n\nFussell:  It was a big moment when Todd English came up to me and said—and I’d never heard of Todd English, and this is at an A.I.W.F.conference-- that’s long ago—in Boston, and he said, “I’ve so wanted to meet you because of the book you wrote about corn.”\n\tI couldn’t get over it.  A chef had read a book about a food subject?  Stunned.  I thought, “Okay, then a whole lot of people are getting interested in food in this way,” and that happened.  I mean, that’s why that book is still in print, because the food world has so expanded who’s part of it.\n\nQ:  I think it’s also still in print because it provided a model for so many other people.\n\nFussell:  Well, yeah, yeah.  Okay, so then we could have single food subjects easier, Mark Kurlansky and Cod and Salt.  But there would be no market for that unless people really wanted to find out where food was and where it came from and how it got to where it is.\n\nQ:  Were you surprised that it continued to be reissued?\n\nFussell:  No.  I would only be surprised if somebody offered me a million dollars.  That’s the only thing that would surprise me.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  How did other people that you knew react to the idea of a single-subject food book?\n\nFussell:  Well, I’ll tell you the booksellers’ attitude, I certainly got no nominations from any of the food organizations for a book without recipes, and the fact that the I.A.C.P. for the first time found a way to reward just plain old scholarship instead of recipes was huge.  So the beginning of the Jane Grigson Awards was an enormous boost, not just for me, but for the whole idea of this is what food’s about, not just how-to’s.  That was big.\n\nQ:  When did it become gratifying, that is, having written this book?\n\nFussell:  Corn?\n\nQ:  For you.\n\nFussell:  I think there are two kinds of moments.  One was on the spot, when I went around to county fairs all over the country, I mean meeting the corn farmers, meeting all these people I could never meet otherwise, and having something to say.  “You’re in here.”  I absolutely loved that, and I think that’s over.  I mean, I don’t think there are any county fairs anymore.  But that was a great moment.  And the same down in Arizona and going to Hopi villages and talking to them and showing them.  If I didn’t have the book to show them, the fact that I was showing that kind of interest, I mean, it was killing how responsive they were, heartbreaking in a way.\n\nQ:  Over that period of time, from ’92 to 2004, did the food world begin to react differently to you as an author, as a legitimate food writer?\n\nFussell:  Let’s see.  What was the year of publication of Corn?\n\nQ:  This says ’92.\n\nFussell:  So nothing much.  Yeah, the Grigson Award is what made the difference, not the book.  So then I got to be a scholar and I got recognized by the I.A.C.P.  I got recognized by the A.I.W.F. earlier, but then it kind of morphed, you know.\n\nQ:  Morphed into?\n\nFussell:  Into the I.A.C.P., in effect.  So organizations like that, the A.I.W.F., very much on the outside, and the I.A.C.P. kind of took that over and moved ahead.  So I became known because I did a lot of lecturing, as well as writing, a lot of lecturing.\n\nQ:  A lot of lecturing where?\n\nFussell:  For conventions.  I mean all kinds of conventions, Nestle’s and—it could be some commercial organizations.\n\nQ:  Not necessarily—\n\nFussell:  Not just food.\n\nQ:  —food writers?\n\nFussell:  Right, right.  At universities, museums, or anyplace where there could be tie-ins, because food was getting in the air.  It was getting cachet. \n\nQ:  It must have made a change in how you viewed yourself as a writer, though.  Can you remember how that felt, being asked to speak at these conventions or meetings?\n\nFussell:  Yeah, I loved the fact that people wanted to have food as a main topic.  Whee!  And all aspects of it, which I felt fully equipped to talk about, because there hadn’t been a whole lot of people going to talk to the farmers.  That’s what I did in France.  Well, I could do that in America, and a lot easier because I understood what they said most of the time much better.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, you did Crazy for Corn, which came out in ’95.\n\nFussell:  And those are the recipes that were ready to go into the Corn book, but by that time that book was so—no more.  No more text.  Get rid of that.\n\nQ:  So how easy was it to get a contract to do a book with those recipes?\n\nFussell:  Well, as Susan Friedman said, who is the one who finally published it, she said, “Oh, I see, Betty.  This is the stuff that is left over from the Corn book.”\n“Not exactly, Susan, but, yeah.”  That was easy, but it was not well published, in my view, so I was not happy with it.\n\nQ:  Now Home Bistro, that’s ’97.  What was going on—\n\nFussell:  Right, and that really just combined Eating In and Home Plates, which Dan Halpern of Ecco Press, he was an old pal from Princeton—\n\nQ:  Dan Halpern?\n\nFussell:  Dan Halpern, who lived in Princeton—no, he lived in New York then, but I knew him through Princeton friends.  I knew him through the literary world as a publisher of poets.  He’s done a cookbook with Mark Strand’s wife.  He was always a foodie.  Why?  Because he’s from California.\n\tSo I was fascinated at this time by the number of guys who had eaten beautifully all of their lives and had never set foot in the kitchen.  So they had the palate, but their wife was suddenly, “What?”  She said, “Work?”  That’s a huge shift again, so guys for the first time were forced to do some cooking at home.  Now, this would have been toward the end of the eighties, wives going back to work.  Then the guys thought, “Oh, that’s kind of fun.”  They were the big fans of Julia.  So the first one, Eating In, was to make a cookbook so small that a guy could put it in his pocket when he’s at the—\n\nQ:  Literally in his breast pocket?\n\nFussell:  Right, at the supermarket, and say, “Let’s see.  What’s around here?  Okay, all I need is a lemon, a garlic.”  So it’s really, really simple stuff, and yet the flavors are what his palate by that time would have been trained to have.\n\nQ:  No kidding?  I mean, publishers saw it that way as a vehicle that would reach—well, I guess it could be women as well as men, but—\n\nFussell:  Yeah, yeah, but I mean it was something pocket-size to take with you when you’re shopping, because the whole point is you can make anything out of anything, you just need five ingredients, lemon, garlic, and cilantro, etc., pasta, maybe some cream.  So that was designed just for this.  My daughter did the illustrations.  I mean, this is just a little fun thing.  Then that took off a bit, enough so that a nice girl at—was that Doubleday, said, “I want a sequence.”  So we did Home Plates to just follow up, because there were an infinite number of recipes you could do that way.\nThen Dan said, “Hey, let’s put them together and do a hardback.”  So this is kind of through friends, more or less.\n\nQ:  Were you supporting yourself entirely at that point through these books?\n\nFussell:  Not through the books, but mostly through—I was making some pretty good money food writing.  The best pay was Lear’s [Magazine], when I was on Lear’s, haha, that craziness, that complete craziness.  You could make some pretty good money with two articles.  It’s the articles that were the bread and butter.  The books were never making money.\n\nQ:  Magazine articles?\n\nFussell:  Magazine articles for every possible thing that is on wheels, yeah.\n\nQ:  However, My Kitchen Wars was quite a different approach.\n\nFussell:  Right.  Now, if I were a commercially minded person, which it would benefit my children if I were, but I’m not, I would have followed the Corn book with what I thought of then, with a beef book.  That was in my head then.\n\nQ:  The idea came to you at that point?\n\nFussell:  Yeah, yeah, because I realized that there was a big connection here that I wasn’t making.  There are whole lots of nice contrasts and there was a continuity.  Okay.  But instead, I made another very deliberate choice and that was, “You know, I want to write a book where the writing counts, where the writing really counts, and it’s not the subject.”  So I thought, “This is the time to do that.”  I was twenty years away from the marriage.  I always knew I was going to write about the marriage because I felt it embraced so many women.  It was so typical of the war years and post-war years.  So I got these fellowships, MacDowell, the writing colonies.\n\nQ:  To work on the book?\n\nFussell:  To work on that book, that’s right.  That was my writing book, my book about writing.\n\nQ:  Now, it had six editions presumably—\n\nFussell:  Six editions?\n\nQ:  That’s what I’ve read, between—\n\nFussell:  How can that be?\n\nQ:  Maybe not.\n\nFussell:  Oh, I don’t know.\n\nQ:  You don’t think so?  Was that successful?\n\nFussell:  None of them are successful from my point of view in terms of making money.\n\nQ:  That’s what I meant.\n\nFussell:  None of them make money.  None of them have ever made money for me.\n\nQ:  Gee, today if something like My Kitchen Wars came out, presumably you’d be on every talk show possible.\n\nFussell:  I don’t think so.  I don’t think so.  There’s been too many.  It’s not sensational enough.  Mine was toward the beginning of the explosion of food memoirs, but it got quite cold-shouldered from the food world because it was too personal, it was about a marriage.  I mean, that’s not about food; that’s about a marriage.\n\nQ:  That’s why I thought it would be very popular now.\n\nFussell:  I think we’re over the memoir explosions.  There are too many of them now, but then I don’t have a good finger on that pulse ever.\n\nQ:  On the timing.  Interesting.\n\nFussell:  I’m always ahead of that moment when things come in, and that doesn’t bother me.  It’s just that I’m not the kind who makes money.  Damn.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Interesting.  The concept for My Kitchen Wars was what?\n\nFussell:  Because I literally felt that Corn had used me.  So I thought here’s where the subject was so much bigger than I had imagined and it completely engulfed me.  Okay.  Okay.  I used the first person there just as a way to get into this, but Corn used me up in a way.  Okay.  Okay.  I want to do the opposite.  I want to use food to say something else, to describe my life.  So I felt it was a very deliberate choice of using it metaphorically, whereas Corn was substance as well as metaphorical in a huge, huge way.  So this is a shift toward the metaphorical possibilities of food.\n\nQ:  Do you get a lot of inquiries about it now, My Kitchen Wars?\n\nFussell:  No, I get responses still that completely astonish me.  I mean, the world of the anonymous comment had come in at that time.  I don’t think I saw half of the stuff, because I wouldn’t even know how to look for it.  I was constantly astonished by the people who really thought, “What is this sour-grapes woman talking about?”  Angry, angry, a lot, or disgusted.  I mean, you’re not supposed to write about personal things like that.  A lot of stuff.\n\nQ:  It’s quite poignant.\n\nFussell:  Well, I thought it was…..\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFussell – 2 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Betty Fussell     \t\t\t\t\t\t          Session #3\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t  New York City\n\nDate:  May 20, 2009\n\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It’s May 20, 2009 and I’m with Betty Fussell doing the conclusion of our previous interview.\n\tGood morning.  How are you?\n\nFussell:  Good morning, Judy.\n\nQ:  We were talking about the general reaction to My Kitchen Wars and I was curious to know how your children reacted to it.\n\nFussell:  My son, who is a writer, said, “Mom, this is the best thing you ever wrote.”  My daughter, who is a painter, rather than a writer, and a cartoonist, didn’t read it until a year after it had been published and went into a complete tizzy.  [laughs]  I had offered to each of them to send them the manuscript to see, because each had asked me in their way, “Is there any news in here for me?”  I said, “No, not as such,” but, of course, the whole book is my point of view, therefore that part, in detail, is certainly new territory for each of them.\nI think both of them, including my son who said, “Best thing you ever wrote,” that was a distancing.  I think he realized this was a profoundly disturbing thing for a family that was already fractured and gone.  My daughter took it very personally, and this still puzzles me in a way, that somehow her name was associated with it all.  So each had his own relationship.  My son, because he had written a book, a memoir, of himself, in effect, by writing about his time in bodybuilding, he wrote a wonderful book called Muscle: Confessions of a Unlikely Bodybuilder, unlikely because he graduated from Oxford.  Okay, that’s not the usual guy to go to Gold’s Gym.\nBut I found that when I wanted to write another, a kind of sequence to this later on, I started a book, I changed its name so often I forget what I started with, but I found I really had trouble writing it because of the kids and I could feel their anxiety and censorship, so I gave up on that.  I’d really written quite a bit of it.\n\nQ:  What was it about?\n\nFussell:  It was about life after divorce in New York City.  But actually I’ve got to do another ring on that on the next book that I write that is going to be about being, by now, a very old woman in New York.  It’ll center on food again, but it will use food as the kind of going metaphor for this stage in everybody’s life that in our culture we manage to avoid ever looking at.  So it takes up all the issues that I love to talk about.\n\nQ:  I would think that would be a bestseller.\n\nFussell:  No, because people still don’t like to look at it.  It is not a natural seller.  Like Sex and the City, it is not like Sex and the City. It’s something else.  There’s age and the city.  Okay.  That’s a downer for many, many people.\n\nQ:  Age and sex in the city?  Well, all right.  However, other people have used the book.  To me it was very, very moving as a woman’s document.  Also in terms of the food I thought it was fascinating.  But have academics used the book?\n\nFussell:  Yes, there’s one, Ann Snitow, S-n-i-t-o-w, who’s a professor at The New School, and I’ve known her for years and she’s specialized in literature and gender studies.  So she uses it as a textbook in her course.  I expected women my age to respond because we’ve been through the same periods of history, but I love it when daughters of friends—now, these are Tucky’s peers, but they’re not my daughter, therefore I got a huge and wonderful response from them because they are fascinated by their mothers.  They recognize that there are enormous differences between their generation and their moms’.  So I love this coming together of the generations that way.\n\nQ:  I guess it would be both in how much they cooked and their personal lives, it would be very different from various generations or could be.\n\nFussell:  The way those two things go together, personal life and cooking, is, of course, very different, yes.  But the next generation is the one who’s coming, that generation is coming back to food in a huge way.  So you have these fascinating layers to me.\n\nQ:  How do you see that?\n\nFussell:  The feminist generation would be my daughter’s.  This isn’t true of mine, but of that group.  They’re the ones who said, “I’m out of the kitchen.  I’m in with the boys and I’m making money and I’m going to break the ceilings.”  Okay.  Below that one, and it’s part of the blogging, every man, every women for himself, everybody’s an entrepreneur.  Everybody is selling him herself in a good way, as well as not so good.  So the function of that voice is advertisements for myself.  Fascinating, where it removes gender entirely.\n\nQ:  Let’s get back to that in a minute, just before that, because I don’t want to let you get too deeply into it.  Let’s talk about Raising Steaks, how that happened, how you got into it.  I would imagine after Corn in some ways it would be a logical next step.\n\nFussell:  It was the logical next book because it was national, it was epic in size, and even though beef was imported, as opposed to corn, which was native, actually it made for me in my head a nice pairing, because it was a different part of the same kind of narrative.  This was before Michael Pollan.  It was not before Eric Schlosser, but certainly before Michael Pollan, who’s done so well in making all the corn connections with beef.  I didn’t really know details about the industrialization of beef, not until I explored it for the book.  This is actually before Pollan’s books had come out, but my research was, again, a discovery.  Ah!  I didn’t realize how closely the corn industry was tied to the beef industry or why, and I found the history of this utterly fascinating because it was so deeply embedded in our agribusiness and the history of that, and yet the practicing ranchers knew so little of it.\n\nQ:  Had you thought through what you wanted to research before you set out to do it?\n\nFussell:  Only in the general way of landscape, because I always wanted to write about the West in which I grew up, because I love the West and I love the ideas about the West, which are so American romantic, hilariously, just hilariously.  So having lived all my life in the East, my adult life, I wanted to bring together East and West.  This I knew, but other than that, I didn’t think about the relation of East and West to Spanish and British.  I didn’t think about the relation of the ecologies historically and politically, how that worked and how it still works.  I mean, there’s still so many dynamics there that just personally fascinate me because they define our country, and that’s the relation of huge empty spaces to very compact but huge vertically, vertical cities.  So the urban and the rural is another of our continuing dynamic where Europe doesn’t apply and China doesn’t apply.  We don’t have anything to compare ourselves to.  That’s my big point always, you know.\n\nQ:  When you were doing this research, was it a gradual realization that the agribusiness was as important a part of it as it is, or did you start out with a pretty good knowledge of that?\n\nFussell:  No, I really learned the agribusiness on the ground talking to people and the Internet.  Ah!  So in a way that’s a blessing that you could find out fairly quickly about corporate structures that would take you a lot of time to find out if you’re such an outsider as I am.\n\nQ:  You mean the Internet made that possible?\n\nFussell:  The Internet.  The information on the Internet for that kind of thing is terrific.\n\nQ:  Did you find it surprising, shocking, the relationship of the agribusiness to this industry?\n\nFussell:  No, because I know—I mean anybody who cares about food and has the general pictures, the general ideas that things are, ah, we’ve been bombarded for decades now by all the organizations that, again, pick up speed on something like the Internet because they can confer with each other.  All these consumers’ unions and all the guys who have been on the fringe and constitute, in effect, the grassroots movements that have a lot of energy and restructuring because they can communicate all the time.  It’s a huge motor.\n\nQ:  In advance, how did you plan the research for such an enormous subject?\n\nFussell:  The research remained out of control because I had a lot of trouble finding a right structure that would carry throughout the book, and I really started it by regions, so in my head it was southern cattle in the deep South are entirely different from western cattle up there, let’s say in the deserts of Oregon.  So I had in my head a regional map.  It in fact, that’s not where the book was; the book was on issues much more.  So I kept having to restructure it and restructure it in my head.  It remained an unwieldy structure.  I never quite got it as orderly I would like it, so it’s not as easy for the reader as I wish it were.\n\nQ:  What were the main points you were trying to communicate?\n\nFussell:  I was trying to communicate the dynamic.  We set up a long time ago a theatrical dynamic by the nature of Native Indians and colonists.  So that’s very basic to our country.\n\nQ:  Play that out a little bit in terms of the beef industry.\n\nFussell:  In the beef industry that’s the way in which the very different ecology, East and West, affects everything and the way in which the colonizers, their ideas of land, their use of land, all of this, their ideas of the wild, the ideas of property, everything gets tied in with their traditions of agriculture, which are completely different.  Spanish ranching is completely different from English sustainable farms.  No, but because the East planted their structures on the West, it’s the eastern ideas that were laid like a blueprint on land totally unsuitable.\n\nQ:  Like what eastern ideas, that is?\n\nFussell:  The eastern ideas of small units.  It’s the yeoman plot.  That’s the Jeffersonian ideal.  Okay.  Every man can have his little plot of land.  He will own that, he will till that.  Impossible in the deserts and highlands of the West.  This was made very clear by John Wesley Powell when he went off and surveyed.  He said, “This ain’t gonna work.”\nBut the bureaucracy has built one way, but it affects everything.  The Bureau of Land Management, it affected now the national preserves, the national forests.  So all the thinking about how you use land, to whom does it belong and why and what is its purpose and how do you use it, what’s the relation of state government to federal governments on this, those issues are live and well.  It has to do now with ranchers and what they’re allowed to do.  In the West you have to use public lands, you can’t raise any cattle because it’ scrub.  They don’t get enough feed.  Oh, okay.\n\nQ:  We talked a little bit about James Beard before.  I must say in reading some of your things and James Beard things, it struck me that your western origins really informed so much of the way you went about things.\n\nFussell:  They informed also M.F.K. Fisher’s and Julia Child’s.  Okay.  Yeah, where you come from matters.  It’s the biographical terroir.\n\nQ:  Is there any way you could characterize how that western vision is different from eastern vision or the central vision or just plain how the western vision is different?\n\nFussell:  From my point of view, but of course it’s the point of view of a westerner, so from my point of view, it is much freer and more informal, much less structured by—for me, the East has always seemed much closer to its European roots; the West is not.  The West has always had a much larger influence from the Far East; it’s always had more Asian.  Okay, that’s going to affect things.  Also the West is where you went to get rid of structures.  So it’s that much further from Europe, yeah, it shows, it shows in daily life, it shows in manners.\n\tMy daughter, who never lived in the West and is now in Arizona, okay, she notices it immediately, you have to make your own community.  You don’t have a community of any kind that you can just drop into, and everybody’s in the same boat.  Okay, that makes a difference.\n\nQ:  Did the experience of working on the book change the way you buy meat, eat meat, cook meat?\n\nFussell:  Yes, all of those.  I certainly do not buy hamburger in supermarkets.  I’ve always been careful about hamburger, because I really love hamburger.  Okay.  But now I only eat hamburgers at restaurants I trust, you know, or preferably I make them at home by grinding a cut.  Since there aren’t any butchers left, so Jefferson Market is gone, okay, that was the last butcher who’d grind for you, you know, replaced by Gristede’s.  Okay.\n\tIn terms of steak, I’m having a fascinating time with steak, as I do buy supermarket steaks to see where they are, and also because I want to know, because they’re doing a much better job in rescuing cuts, so you’ll get things like the tri-tip, the flat iron.  The processors are doing this, so to utilize more of the carcass at higher prices.  Okay.  Now, that’s kind of fascinating, because with marination you can tenderize anything.  All right.  We’re moving closer to Spanish methods and Far Eastern methods of using thinner strips of beef from tougher cuts.  So we don’t have always to have the best of—we never get prime in a store; you only get that in restaurants.  But the best beef you can buy in a store will be choice.  Okay.  All of this remains—it’s in continual flux and fascinating.\n\nQ:  Do you eat meat often?\n\nFussell:  Yeah.  I was thinking of this the other day.  I really eat few carbos.  I always think of them as fillers, and I have a need, either biological or psychological, for protein and vegetables and fruits.\n\nQ:  I can’t resist asking you if you cook meat to the very high temperatures that the safety regulations urge people to.\n\nFussell:  Oh, of course not.  I mean, this is why I don’t eat hamburgers anymore, because ah, ah, ah, unless it’s a place that I know will cook it rare for me.  Okay.  I mean, for me anything over rare is overdone, absolutely overdone.  I’m sorry, American ranchers, but so many of them, they have these beautiful steaks and they kill them.\n\nQ:  Is that because the flavor of the meat gets lost as it’s cooked, overcooked?\n\nFussell:  It’s tradition.  It’s their mother’s cooking.  It’s part of the conservatism of the Midwest and as part of the tradition of the West.\n\nQ:  Let’s go back to the book you said you were working on now, or maybe you’re working on more than one at the same time.\n\nFussell:  Well, I keep shifting the one I’m working on now.  I was starting to do How to Cook a Coyote to pick up on the same thing of survival.  I’m really interested in how you survive as a person whose energy is constantly diminishing, how you survive in a place that is built on electrical energy charges that are at a certain level.  Walking on the streets is the most interesting exercise I know, because you’re constantly being run down by hoards of people.  Everybody is under forty is for me twelve.  Hoards of twelve-year-olds.  And we do not have a culture that in any way respects in any way anybody who’s old.  Just push them.  Run them over.\n\nQ:  What is the structure of the book?\n\nFussell:  Working on it.  Working on it, but it will be through food and so that will be the—\n\nQ:  Examining what through food?\n\nFussell:  Your food patterns change.  What you want from food is different.  You look at food differently because you’re now part of the food chain or part of the organic world that is drying up and dying and rotting, you know.  Okay.  No, absolutely, you attach yourself to the cycle and you’re more and more aware of the cycle because you’re not on the upward path; you’re on the downward.  Okay.  That affects everything you do.  It certainly affects meals.  I’m aware that I can’t eat nearly as much.  I eat much—not lighter, but intensely, but much less, much less in quantity and my taste has changed from—I can’t tolerate sour, as in pickle.  I have never had a sweet tooth, but it has gone more towards sweet.  Okay.  These are interesting things to observe to me.  So it affects what you eat daily.  And also I have no patience with anything that is complicated.  I improvise everything out of the fridge, which I love because it remains constantly a source of new discovery, improv, wonderful for me.\n\nQ:  What’s the coyote reference?\n\nFussell:  The coyote reference is the symbol of survival in Native American, and because it’s completely American, a North American breed, because mythically they’re the trickster.  They’re not about force; they’re about cleverness and deception.\n\nQ:  They’re very scary.\n\nFussell:  And they’re everywhere.  They’re the predator, the most common predator in the United States today, which I love.  They’re in the streets of Boston.  They’re everywhere.  They’ve invaded the East.  I love it.  I absolutely love it.\n\nQ:  I didn’t know that.  I really thought it was a western—\n\nFussell:  No, no, we got rid of wolves, so who thrives?  Who thrives?  The coyote.  There are constant sightings in Boston.  I mean, that’s so funny to me, because Boston is my symbol for the East and that was what I experienced early.\n\nQ:  Have you ever been able to cook coyote meat?\n\nFussell:  I don’t know that anybody, by choice, eats coyote, because they are tough and stringy because they’re small.  But if you can eat a dog, you can eat a coyote.  Well, many do, you know.  Okay.  Okay.  So if you’re surviving, my point is you’ll eat anything.  But it also allows me a way to work.  I mean this idea was a way to work in my going hunting with my son in October, starting hunting when I’m blind, near blind, and I’ve never shot a rifle.  Okay, that has its own challenges, but there are all those who hunt seriously.  My son lives on all the food, all the jerky, the deer jerky and the meat jerky.  Bear, he got bear last year.  Okay.  So he’ll live on that through the winter.  Okay.  Well, I better find out what that is.  I mean, I’d like to find out what that is.  That’s the coyote world.\n\nQ:  You seem to have been able to embrace where you are in life at this point.\n\nFussell:  I’ve always embraced the age, except adolescence, high school.  That was not a good period.  I did not like it.  I didn’t rejoice in being young then because I didn’t know I was young.  I just thought, “I got to get out of here.”\n\nQ:  Along those lines, how did it happen that you were chosen for the Vogue issue on what, however they called it, decades, women of—\n\nFussell:  Because they needed someone for the eighties.\n\nQ:  But there are lots of people.\n\nFussell:  There are lots of people in their eighties and, right, it’s a proper question.  But I had met one of the editors and she liked what I had written and she liked Kitchen Wars, and, I only learned much later, she grew up in Oakland, she’s a westerner, but she’s lived here.  She’s a very eastern girl now.  So I think she saw subliminally, maybe, something of her own exile or transposition to another place.\n\nQ:  Of course, you wouldn’t have been chosen had you not looked great.  I mean that is another aspect of it.\n\nFussell:  Well, anybody can look great with the kind of cameramen that they get.  Ah.  You know, photographers can do absolutely anything they want to.\n\nQ:  Well, you’re being modest.  You are working on another book, as well, aren’t you?  Was it the Eating in Bed or is that part of—\n\nFussell:  No, I’ve changed that one, because Deborah Madison and her husband have a book called exactly that, and it’s a wonderful and I gave them a big blurb.  Whoops, no, stop.  I can’t do that that soon, so, no.  But it was the same—this is a thread of living alone and finding the ways in which food really enhance that kind of life, the solitary life.\n\nQ:  The opposite of age is this digital world and the world of blogging, and your website seems to be, if not embracing it, certainly taken to that with enthusiasm.\n\nFussell:  Embracing it would imply a degree of knowledge I do not yet have, but I’m finally getting it only because I’ve met all these wonderful young bloggers.  I mean, to say that they’re young bloggers is a redundancy.\n\nQ:  How did you meet this group of people?\n\nFussell:  Because they’re foodies.  They just had the first international food bloggers conference in Seattle.\n\nQ:  That is extraordinary.\n\nFussell:  I mean, they’re already meeting face-to-face in cities.\n\nQ:  Did you go?\n\nFussell:  No.  No, no.  No, no.  Not that I wouldn’t have if somebody had paid me to go.  I mean, the whole thing about blogging, now, “Who’s paying?” I keep asking them.  So I think we’re at a moment where, “Ah!  I’ll do the blog because it’s so easy and it will put my foot in the food door.” Okay.  So there are all these—they have to get advertisers, and they’re going to find that’s increasingly difficult as they sort themselves out, because they’re all competitors.  At the moment they’re all palsies and they all link each other.  So this is this huge, huge net that is daily heightened by things like Facebook, and before that, YouTube, but that seems more related to imagery.  Facebook is just one form of—it’s a form of Twitter, or can be.  But it started for me with a food person who said, “Hey, this is a great way to extend your relationship to the food community.”\n\t“Okay.”   I don’t know if it’s doing that or not.\n\nQ:  When was that?\n\nFussell:  This last year I’ve started Facebook.  I like hearing from people I haven’t heard from for thirty years, but there aren’t too many of those.  It’s more people I’ve never heard of who say, “Please confirm me as friend.”  You know, you have to do that or punch “ignore.”  Well, that doesn’t seem right.  So I don’t know what its function is.  I do see what the function of blogging is, but it’s going to change.  It’s going to change.  As the magazines and newspapers go under and the bloggers will increase, they’re going to find they’re following some of the same competitive paths, and some are going to drop out, because they can’t do that forever unless they’re a trust-fund baby, and there are a lot of those doing that.\n\nQ:  What do you see as the function of it now?\n\nFussell:  It is a new form of community-making.  The fact that it’s a global community is very unwieldy and completely at the moment horizontal in the way that every man’s—there are no more experts, there are no authorities.  Every man speaks with an equal voice.  It’s a kind of hilarious extension of the American idea of equality, but it’s off the charts.  We don’t know what’s going to happen, I don’t think.  It has all of these different layers to it, which is like Google.  It’s like the information you’re getting.  When you can know everything, it makes all information equal, and therefore none of it valuable.\n\nQ:  On the website you mentioned it as a resurgence of community-building, but as you say that community is now horizontal.  It’s not a traditional community.\n\nFussell:  It is certainly not a traditional community, but as human beings we do traditional things with a new form of holding hands, let’s say, showing pictures, making connections.\n\nQ:  All in all, do you think it’s good, useful, these food blogs?  Not restaurant blogs, but food ones.\n\nFussell:  I think they’re fascinating.  To what uses they’re going to be put, I don’t know.  For the moment, sure, I find out about fermented garlic from a food blogger I met.  She happens to advertise for Earthy Delights, which sells fermented garlic.  Otherwise, it’s not something you can get in any specialty store that I’ve seen, unless you know some Korean specialty markets.  Stuff like this I would not know about.  I would never sample.  I love that aspect.  Oh, okay, I learned that its use has been traditional in Korean cuisine.  I know nothing about that. Wonderful.\n\tOn the other hand, that’s just one little blitz, one little blitzy moment.  What does it fit into as a frame?  I don’t know.  I don’t know.  It’s too new and it’s too growing.  It’s growing so fast and all the kids spend all their time there too.  Okay.  Then you don’t have time to do other things.  That’s interesting and that’s going to have consequences.\n\nQ:  Like what?\n\nFussell:  Well, if all your time is on the screen, all right, it’s a whole different way of relating.  So you make one connection, but you lose another.  You lose intimacy, you gain spread.  Okay.  And you certainly lose depth.\n\nQ:  I know you feel very strongly about food being a very personal thing.  Do you think that demonstrates itself in these blogs or just—\n\nFussell:  Yes, I do.\n\nQ:  How does that work?\n\nFussell:  Because everybody’s personal taste, it’s your own voice and it’s your own taste and that’s what you put out there.  So this is the way I do something.  Is that the best way?  Well, who knows?  No.  But it doesn’t matter, this is the way I do it, and you think somebody’s going to be interested in that.  That’s new.  Why should they be interested?  Because I’m a blog and look, it’s got this great design, and because I can say funny things sometimes, and of course you’re going to be interested.\n\nQ:  Do you read them?\n\nFussell:  When I meet bloggers, then that’s for me the only way.  Otherwise, I’m not going through and looking for blogs.  But when I meet somebody, then I want to know more about them, if I’m interested.  I’m going to have drinks next week with somebody who has been—now she would be in her thirties, mid-thirties, she’s been trained as a journalist, but magazines are going out, so she’s looking for different connections.  But I really liked her, so we’re going to have a drink together.  All I know about her is that she does a food blog.\n\nQ:  Who’s paying, I mean at this point?\n\nFussell:  Who’s paying for the drink?\n\nQ:  Yes.  [laughter]\n\nFussell:  Well, we were just taken.  We met at a dinner, which was a woman who—what’s the name of her company?  It’s a book connection.  She stages book events.  Okay.  But she’s also paid by Microsoft.  So she’s got a job, so she’s already made the bridge.  She’s a very smart, entrepreneurial girl, as they all are entrepreneurial.  Microsoft paid for our dinner at Tabla.  Okay.  But that’s right.  It is always the question and always relevant.\n\nQ:  What do you think the future of food writing is, or is it too hard to tell?\n\nFussell:  Well, we’re all going to be talking about food, and therefore, as its writing is taking place most significantly on the screen, not on print, not in print—\n\nQ:  You really think that—\n\nFussell:  Oh, it’s moving very rapidly.  In terms of informal, do I think books online will replace—will Kindle replace the artifact?  No.\n\nQ:  Not that so much.  It’s really more the short format of this kind of writing makes it so impossible to go into depth about things.\n\nFussell:  Well, at the moment, when the blog is successful, these bloggers are thinking about, “Now, when I write my book about this subject.”  So this is a moment when both these things are going on at once.  It’s an entrée to getting a book contract, but you don’t count on getting known first through books or even through the freelance magazine articles that then would lead to a book.  No.  So it’s replacing those magazine articles very fast.\n\nQ:  But the goal still is having a more solid identity?\n\nFussell:  The goal is to get known so you can do what you want to do, but we’ll see what is, you know.  Is food history going to disappear?  No.\n\nQ:  Did you feel, however, in creating your own website that you absolutely had to include this world?\n\nFussell:  No, I didn’t know anything about it.  Somebody said, “Do you want to blog?”  I said, “I don’t know what that is.”  So I’ve been learning by doing.  I love the idea that I can get an idea and sit down and turn out seventy-five words—a few paragraphs is a long blog.  But the fact that you could do it that quickly has great advantages for somebody who’s been writing now for so many years, because you know you’ve got the craft of shaping, and then it becomes fun.  It’s like doing piano scales.  Oh, I’ll do a little variation here.  It’s a variation and that is fun.\n\nQ:  You just started to talk before about how you’re cooking now and how that’s a little different.\n\nFussell:  I think the cooking is the same.  It’s the short attention span.  [laughs]  It does fit the world of blogging perfectly.\n\nQ:  But in your life.\n\nFussell:  In my life, but that’s because I’m not cooking for a family.  But none of these kids, none of the blogger kids that I’m meeting have families.\n\nQ:  They wouldn’t have time to blog.  [laughs]\n\nFussell:  No, that’s right.  That’s right.  They see themselves as the norm.  They don’t see being married with a couple of kids or more.  They don’t see that as the norm for them.\n\nQ:  The website is also full of your upcoming events and speeches.  It must give you a feeling of relevance to keep being included in all these things.\n\nFussell:  I’m delighted.  I’m delighted that, (a), they remember I still exist.  You know, that’s always a question.  And, (b), that I’m not yet so senile that they are afraid to put me on a platform.  These are all concerns, because we’ve all seen examples of all of this.\n\nQ:  Are you going to cook today at all?\n\nFussell:  Oh yeah.  No, I cook every day.  I really don’t like to go out to lunch because I don’t want to take the time.\n\nQ:  So what’s on the menu today?\n\nFussell:  Ah, now, that’s the kind of thing I think about when I get up in the morning, “What am I going to have for lunch?”  (A), I don’t want to go out, I never want to go out and shop; I want everything just to be at hand.  I remember I hadn’t eaten up the leftover Chinese duck last night.  So, okay, so what am I going to have?  I still have some unopened bacon from Flying Pig at Union Square Market from last time I was there.  Oh, goody, I can eat that with some jalapeno cheese bread, which I picked up last time I was at the Market.  So this is the way the thought goes.  Okay, I’m taken care of; I don’t have to worry.\n\nQ:  And tonight, do you know what’s—\n\nFussell:  And tonight, let’s see.  Okay, if I have bacon from—actually, I’m going out to dinner, but if I weren’t, I’d say, “Okay, I’ve got some really great eggs from the Union Square.”  Ah, you know, as long as there are eggs in the fridge, I never think about food.  There’s always some pasta, there’s always some rice, there’s always garlic, olive oil.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFussell – 3 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n","description":"The distinguished historian Betty Fussell was one of the first American writers to focus on food as a legitimate subject of scientific, social, and anthropological inquiry.\r\n\r\nIn her 1999, The Story of Corn: the Myths and History, the Culture and Agriculture, the Art and Science of America's Quintessential Crop, Fussel used the history of corn to tell a distinctly American story. She also created a genre, now much imitated by other writers, focused on a single foodstuff.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1927 in California and reared there, she has made her home in New York's Greenwich Village for decades. She lives around the corner from James Beard's cooking school run out of his home. Her only contact was a week's worth of classes there, but they share an abiding passion for American food.\r\n\r\nHer essays in literary journals, major newspapers, national magazines and encyclopedias are written with a grace few food writers can match. She also lectures at museums, universities, state fairs, corn festivals, historical societies and culinary groups. In 1999, her food memoir, My Kitchen Wars, traced her life from her childhoood through her marriage to a college sweetheart, her travails as an academic wife, her own academic career, the women's movement, and her wider success when she found her essential subject: food.

The piece described the plight of impoverished senior citizens who received food aid from the city during the week, but had no source of food on weekends and holidays.\r\n\r\nThe situation appalled her, and she was inspired to call everyone she could think of who might have money or goods to ameliorate the situation.\r\n\r\nJames Beard was one of those people. It was common knowledge that food companies often sent Beard samples of their products in the hope that he would try them, like them, and, with luck, promote them in his columns. Greene figured Beard might have some actual food to contribute on a more-or-less regular basis.\r\n\r\nJumping into action, she phoned him to enlist his support, and encouraged him to join her effort to remedy the situation. The result was CityMeals On Wheels, where he lent his name and enthusiasm to a project that still exists today.\r\n\r\nGreene left New York Magazine in 2008 and today has become an active free-lance writer, blogger, and tweeter.\n\nInterviewee:  Gael Greene\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t    Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t        New York City\n\nDate:  June 19, 2009\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is June 19, and I am with Gael Greene in her apartment in Manhattan.\nGood morning.\n\nGreene:  Good morning.\n\nQ:  Could we start this with your telling me something about where and when you were born, a little bit about your early life, and then how you got into food writing?\n\nGreene:  I was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1933, December, so that makes me a year younger than you think I am.  It was kind of a middle-class neighborhood, a two-family house, maybe.  I went to high school in Detroit.  I graduated at fifteen and a half, went to University of Michigan because everybody else was going, and I was afraid to go somewhere where I didn’t know anybody.  It was a very college-oriented high school, very success-oriented high school, big brotherhood high school.  [laughs]  We thought.\n\tThen in the middle of my sophomore year, I fell in love with somebody, broke my heart, and I persuaded my parents to let me go to Paris for a year, where I fell in love with food, discovered food.  I came back just for Christmas and ended up going back to school, where I worked for the Detroit Free Press and Time and Life magazine as a stringer on campus.\n\nQ:  How did they find you?\n\nGreene:  I inherited the job.  I asked the person who had the job if he would recommend me.  At Time-Life I’m not sure how I got that.  Somehow I knew the bureau chief, and I actually placed a lot of stories.  I was so compulsive and obsessive—I’m not sure which is the correct word—that that’s all I did was work for the Michigan Daily and be a stringer for the last few years of college.  Then I tried to get a job in New York.  I came whenever I had a weekend or a three-day weekend.  I couldn’t get anything.  Nobody seemed to be wanting to hire a woman or—\n\nQ:  A very young woman.\n\nGreene:  Or a non-Ivy League.  Time, Inc. was very Ivy League, even though I had worked for them.  Seemed so incomprehensible to me.  So I went to work for UP, which I call UPI in order to seem younger, but it was UP, which the Times figured out when they wrote about me.  I worked for a few months and then I got an offer of a one-week tryout at the New York Post.  I hadn’t worked long enough to get a vacation.\n\nQ:  How on earth did that happen?\n\nGreene:  I came to town every two- or three-day weekend I could, and I endlessly searched.  I was going to Singapore to try to work with the UPI bureau chief there.  He was killed in a riot, so somehow that connected me with Stan Opatowski at the New York Post, and he said—I think it was Stan—“You can come for a one-week tryout in the summer.  Everybody does.”  So that’s how they staffed the paper.  When everyone went on vacation, they brought in aspiring journalists from all over the country, and there was a fabulous prize-winning journalist from the famous Mississippi newspaper that I can’t think the name of at the moment, who was also in that summer.  So I got a two-week tryout, and then I got a month tryout, and then they offered a three-month tryout, and I said, “I can’t do that.  I’m living on the floor of somebody’s apartment and so either hire me or I’m going to Italy.”\n\nQ:  And?\n\nGreene:  “Where men are men.”  And he said, “Okay, we’ll hire you.”\n\nQ:  Could you cook at that point?\n\nGreene:  Yes, I became interested in cooking that year abroad, my junior year abroad, and actually sophomore year.  I met a princapessa in Positano.  She invited me to Rome.  She let me stay in her apartment, and she came home one day with green walnuts and said, “Now we’re going to make a risotto with these fabulous walnuts,” and she destroyed her hands peeling the walnuts and said, “You could make this risotto with ten cents worth of lamb bones.”  So I thought that was so amazing, and when I went back to University of Michigan, had my own apartment, I started cooking.  A way to a man’s heart, it was quite clear.\n\nQ:  I see.  I see.  You wrote that when you were a child you took business trips with your father.\n\nGreene:  Yes, when he came here, when my father came here on buying trips for his store, a woman’s specialty shop.\n\nQ:  So you were a little more sophisticated than had you not done that.\n\nGreene:  Yes.  I had eaten in a few restaurants, although my father’s favorite was Leone’s, which may have seemed sophisticated at the time.  I did know enough to notice when they stopped using real Swiss cheese.\n\nQ:  At what point did you leave the Post and start freelancing, if that’s what you did?\n\nGreene:  I was working on a novel while working for the Post, and I decided I needed time to really work on a novel.  I was living with my husband-to-be and in a fourth-floor walkup of the building where I still live, on the first floor, which is one flight up.  How did that happen?  I think I took a leave of absence to write the book.  The book was apparently impenetrable, and I rewrote it and rewrote it, worked on it, wrote it, and never got anywhere.\nSo I went back to work for the Post and I didn’t like doing one-paragraph squibs, so if I didn’t have a major cover story or feature or a series, I resented sitting there from nine to five.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  This is my continuation of my interview with Gael Greene.  Go ahead.\n\nGreene:  What was the question?\n\nQ:  You were talking about leaving the New York Post and eventually becoming a freelance writer.\n\nGreene:  So I decided to leave the Post and freelance.  I think I must have been freelancing a lot.  Anyway, one of the things that my guy and I did, we moved down to 1B, the so-called first floor, and got married.  We went to Detroit and got married in my sister’s backyard.  One of the things that we did was sex magazines.  There was an editor, a European immigrant editor with a fabulous accent, who we were connected to by—you don’t want all this detail.\n\nQ:  That’s all right.  Go ahead.\n\nGreene:  Sorry I can’t think of his name right this minute, the guy who wrote—no.  Anyway, so we wrote for Top Secret, Vice Squad, all the imitations of Confidential, and we got paid five dollars a page, so we discovered we could triple-space and we discovered we could quadruple-space.  Ernie Tidyman, who wrote Shaft, introduced us to Dr. Dirty Fingers, they called him.  At the meantime, I think I was also writing for Cosmopolitan, before Helen [Gurley Brown] came, and after Helen came, I did about fifty pieces, Ladies’ Home Journal, McCall’s.\n\nQ:  That’s fairly extraordinary, just pouring it out like that.\n\nGreene:  Well, anything they asked.  Anything they asked me to do, usually I did.  Helen, once in a while I would say no because it was too silly or too intimate.  But many of the stories I write here in my file.  Then I did a piece for Clay Felker when New York was part of the Herald Tribune, Sunday magazine.  I did a piece called Here’s Johnny, about Johnny Carson, and I think the second piece I did was the reopening of the Côte Basque by Henri Soulé.  My husband and I were both early foodies before that was a word, and we loved the Café Chauveron, and we were saving our money to go to expensive restaurants, but we were afraid to go to the Pavillon because Soulé was notoriously rude and difficult with anybody he didn’t know or didn’t consider important enough.  So I decided I would do a story about a week in the kitchen at the Pavillon, and I sold it to Ladies’ Home Journal, that had a New York section at that time, and that’s how I got to know Soulé.  So at that point occasionally he invited me for lunch.\n\nQ:  Was that the first food writing that you had done?\n\nGreene:  I think that was the first food writing.  I think I did a piece on who does the best parties, the caterers who do parties, if you could call that a food piece, but that was really—the countdown to the reopening of the Pavillon, it’s on my website, ’65, three years before New York found a backer and started in 1968. \n\nQ:  Could you tell me about Clay Felker calling you and asking you to review restaurants?\n\nGreene:  Well, the reason I started to try to sell food pieces was that I wanted to find a way to finance our meals and our trips.  We had gone to France and discovered three-star restaurants, and we were hooked.  I wanted to be able to either deduct it from my income tax or charge it to someone, so that was the motivation behind trying to sell a food story.  Because I had done the countdown to reopening of the Côte Basque for Clay Felker at the old New York, he must have gotten it in his head that I was a food writer.  So one day the phone rang, and it was Clay saying—a few months after New York Magazine launched, with all its stars, star writers, and Clay said, “We would like you to be the restaurant critic.”\n\tI said, “What?”  Restaurant critic?  That was absolutely not what I was expecting.  I never thought of myself as a food writer.  And he said, “Well, yes.”\n\tI said, “What are you going to tell people are my credentials?”\n\tAnd he said, “Well, aren’t you a food person?”\n\tAnd I said, “Well, I eat around.”  And of course I was known for my cooking.  My husband and I did beautiful little dinners, dinner parties, with great wines.  I said, “I can’t afford to write for you, because I hear you’re only going to pay $300 to everybody, regardless of who they are, until the magazine makes money, and I’m making $2,025 from the magazines I work for.  So I could only afford to write once or twice a year.”\nAnd he said, “Well, as a restaurant critic, you’ll have to write every two weeks.”  And he said, “And people are begging to be the restaurant critic so they can charge all their meals to us.”\nAnd I thought, “Oh, my god.  Oh!  How amazing.”  “Okay, I’ll do it,” before he changed his mind.  I said, “But we have to do it the way Craig Claiborne does it.”  I had just done a piece on Craig for Look magazine, profile, so I told Clay, “He goes minimum of three times.  He takes people, he always pays the bill, he’s always anonymous, and we have to do the same.”\nClay said, “Yes, yes, yes.”  And that was the beginning of the unquestioned expense account, which, of course, in those days was very modest because all the French restaurants had a prix fixe lunch of $7.95.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nGreene:  And fifty cents extra for coffee seemed outrageous to us.  So that was it.\n\nQ:  Had you been writing in first person before that?\n\nGreene:  Well, I wrote a memoir of my life in the newspaper business.  It was published, I think in ’69, Don’t Come Back Without It, so that was in the first person.  Oh yes, of course, at the Post.  Well, that was my thing at the Post.  They loved these first-person exposé series, so I exposed Weight Watchers and fortune tellers.  I guess that’s where I got the “I.”\nBut in the first few years at New York Magazine as a critic, I was very careful to not reveal that I was a woman, and so I wrote in a way that that was never apparent, and I did get letters addressed to Mr. Gael Greene.  I thought there was a lot of stigmatism against women, and being a woman, you weren’t as knowledgeable, and how could you know, and your taste might not be as good.  Of course, my competition was Craig Claiborne, and Roy Andries de Groot was totally dismissive, if that’s a word.\n\nQ:  Of women?\n\nGreene:  Of me when we first met.  He said, “Oh, you’re that little housewife who’s the restaurant critic at New York Magazine.”  We were doing an interview together.  I was so cowed by that, that I didn’t say a word in the interview.\n\nQ:  At what point did you develop a sense that you had created something that was your own voice and really quite good?\n\nGreene:  Well, Clay was always very complimentary, and he would come back and say, “Oh, people just loved your piece on—” whatever.  “And everyone is talking about your—,” blah, blah, blah.\nI think my voice really developed when I decided to write a piece about our first visit to the Pyramides, chez Point, and I realized that most readers were not going to go there, and I wanted them to be able to imagine, feel, touch, smell, really be there, so that they would enjoy reading it, even though it was just beyond anything they would ever do.  So I became aware of describing the smells and the sounds and the tastes and the feelings of being in a great meal, in the middle of a great meal, which I later used in my erotic novels because exactly the same senses are telling you what’s happening when you’re making love.  So the sensuousness of eating, as well as the theater and the business of eating, since I used to say so much seduction is happening at the table, but it was business seduction and domestic seduction.  You’re trying to get your mate to do something, or you’re trying to advance a cause.  That’s what New York dining was often about.  So I think people did start looking at food in another way.\nThis is not James Beard.\n\nQ:  That’s all right.  We’re getting there.\n\nGreene:  Because of the incredible innocence of New Yorkers about food, even the more sophisticated, people who traveled and had money, did not go to France necessarily, did not speak French.  Their idea of a great meal was an overcooked lamb chop and canned baby peas and rice pudding, and people didn’t talk about food.  It was considered vulgar and low class to carry on about what you ate.\n\nQ:  We’re talking about the late sixties into early seventies?\n\nGreene:  Yes, the late sixties, ’68, when I started writing.  So my first approach, of course, was not to take on Craig Claiborne’s favorites, because I didn’t want to—I felt totally uncomfortable there, and wondered if it was worth it, and in some cases felt it wasn’t worth it, so that’s why I chose the ground floor for my first review, because it was brand new and it was the big hot thing of that moment.  But I did realize, as I began doing the French restaurants, that they were very expensive and a lot of the readers would never go, so I thought even though I’m not going to criticize these chefs who’ve been in the kitchen since they were twelve or fourteen, because who am I to tell them they overcooked the lamb, I will describe the sociology of the restaurants, of the look, what people are doing there, and who’s there.  So that very much became an interest of the readers of New York Magazine.\n\nQ:  You’ve written that you tried to get into an advanced cooking class of James Beard.\n\nGreene:  Yes.  I can’t remember what year that was, but my friend Jane Frieman, who was happily married when my husband and I separated, suddenly was separating from her husband, and we were getting closer.  She lived a couple of blocks away from where I was at 73rd and West End.  And somehow together we decided we would take a James Beard course.  I think we decided we should have the advanced class.  Certainly I thought, “How am I going into a beginning class?  It’s so ridiculous.  I’m Gael Greene, the restaurant critic.”\n\nQ:  And you were Gael Greene at what point in your career?\n\nGreene:  It was early.  I have no idea.  It may say in my book when it was.  Maybe Jane will remember.  But the point was that everyone was talking about food, very quickly, even if they weren’t interested in eating that, they were suddenly aware of food because in addition to “The Insatiable Critic,” there was also Milton Glaser and Jerome Snyder’s “Underground Gourmet,” and they were writing about places where you could get dumplings for fifty cents, and drawing pictures of what they looked like so you knew what to order, and maybe people weren’t going to do that, even though they could afford to do that, but suddenly restaurants and food were related to power and getting ahead and socializing in New York, as seen through Clay Felker’s eyes.\n\nQ:  How did you know about the classes?\n\nGreene:  I think I wrote about classes.  New York Times every year, of course, had a huge coverage which grew and grew and grew, of what classes were available, and I had taken some Chinese cooking classes.  I think I took those before James Beard, because when I started to write about Chinese restaurants, I realized I didn’t have any real deep knowledge of Chinese food.  I wanted to know what went wrong, why it went wrong, and a good way to do that would be to learn how to cook Chinese food.  So I took three Chinese food classes and got my information from the New York Times and then decided that we had to cover cooking classes too, so I would go to six classes and do a roundup.  A couple of times I did that.\nJames Beard may have fallen into a “Now we’ll do James Beard next.”  I’m not sure.  Or just that we wanted to go to James Beard’s class.  It was more expensive and it was booked far ahead, was hard to get in, but I thought I wouldn’t have a problem since he would know Gael Greene from New York Magazine.  Or maybe I had even written about him in one of the early pieces I did about the Four Seasons.  He had been called in by Paul Kovi and George Lang, who were running the Four Seasons at that point, to do a riff for them on what they could have on their—\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  This is the second continuation of my interview.\n\nGreene:  I don’t know if the cooking class came before or after my watching James Beard at work, inspiring winter menu at the Four Seasons.\n\nQ:  What do you mean, you watched him at work?\n\nGreene:  Well, they brought him in, and we were talking about how do you go from autumn to winter, and they were explaining all the things they did, the list of items that had to be changed, the upholstery, the jackets, the cummerbunds, the ashtrays, the matches, every single thing that would go from rust color to brown for winter.\n\nQ:  And he made a presentation?\n\nGreene:  Yes, they brought him in.  It may have been partly that they brought him in—I don’t think they did actually bring him in for me.  I think they brought him in to give them ideas for the winter menu.\n\nQ:  And you happened to be there?\n\nGreene:  I was there to hear how it worked.\n\nQ:  Was that the first time you had physically met him?\n\nGreene:  I can’t remember when I met James Beard.\n\nQ:  So they wouldn’t let you into the advanced classes, and then what happened?\n\nGreene:  He was living at the other house before moving, I think, when we took our class, the house on Patchett Place.\n\nQ:  Did you have to wait a long time to get into the class or no?\n\nGreene:  I don’t remember that.  I think we were accepted soon.\n\nQ:  You said it was more expensive than other classes.  Noticeably so?\n\nGreene:  I don’t know, but you could look at the article and see, if I have it in my article.  It might have been $300 or 400.\n\nQ:  For how many people at a time?\n\nGreene:  I don’t remember how many people were in the class.  Maybe twelve.  And I don’t remember how many sessions.  I do have some of the recipes.\n\nQ:  I’d be curious to hear your description of the classes, because you just brought a different eye to it than some people did.\n\nGreene:  Aside from being really offended because I had to take the beginning class, I seem to remember cooking at electric stoves, and I thought that was shocking.  Everybody thought that was shocking.  And they were the kind with no burners; it was just a stovetop, because appliance companies were always giving him things to use or try out.  And I remember—can’t think of his name right now, his assistant.  Clay?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nGreene:  Clay getting everything set up, and how joyous and cheerful and exuberant about food that he was.  I don’t remember if my favorite part came in an advanced class, the story that I tell in Insatiable, where the one particular class was lamb wrapped in a towel and steamed in an enamelware pot, with the towel tied to the handles, and loaded, larded with garlic and, I think, maybe cumin, and every other dish in the class had garlic in it, and we steamed it rare and sliced it and served it with a gremolata, and it was just extraordinary, and I wanted to do that again at home.  I have used that concept for years, including to do scallops with a gremolata and a raw tomato sauce.\n\tAnyway, I left the class, and I was having an affair with a fabulous man, and he picked me up and we were lying in bed a little while later, and he was lying right next to my arm and he said, “There’s garlic coming out of your skin, on your elbow.”  He was kissing me inside of my elbow.  He said, “What is this?  It smells like garlic.”\n\tAnd I said, “Oh, my god, I’m so sorry.”  Of course, we scrubbed and used lemon and everything to get the garlic off our hands, but we were filled with garlic.\n\nQ:  You’d eaten the meal.  I thought it was an extraordinary image, the steaming image, because I guess I’d never thought about that before, and I certainly wouldn’t know how to steam something rare.\n\nGreene:  With a thermometer.  You stuck one of those instant thermometers or whatever the thermometer at that moment.  There was an instant one.  Whether we had instant ones at that point, I believe we did, with the little blue carrying case.  That’s how you do it, and then you stop at 10 degrees or 15 degrees less than you want it to be.\n\nQ:  Had you ever seen that done before, that kind of—\n\nGreene:  No, never.  No, never.  It was totally witchcraft to me.\n\nQ:  So I guess it would have been an advanced class.  You went from the beginning classes to the advanced classes?\n\nGreene:  I did, and then at some point he was doing a class about whether freezing meat affected the taste of meat when you cooked it, which every serious food person totally believed, and I think he was writing an article.  He had this cut frozen, this cut not.  We cooked everything, and I saw him slicing the meat and some fat came off and he stuck it in his mouth and he said, “[laughs], I’m a fat boy!”\n\nQ:  Did you get to know him personally through those classes or did that come later?\n\nGreene:  Yes, and I’m trying to remember if we—maybe we had lunch together occasionally and we talked on the phone.  If I had a question, he helped me.  He said very nice things about me behind my back, which was wonderful.  I don’t know what not nice things he said behind my back.  [laughs]  But I was never part of the regular people who gathered in his kitchen that I heard about, like Celia from the AP, and maybe Barbara Kafka.  Maybe she wasn’t totally in that group, but very, very close to him.  But Jane and I decided to invite him for dinner one night at my house.\n\nQ:  Pretty brave.\n\nGreene:  It was really—yes, it was very brave.  But we had a setup in the house where in the back room at the window seat we would put a table covered with an extraordinary floor-length deep royal blue, navy almost, velvet corduroy that matched the curtains behind the window seat, and then three chairs on the outside and three people could sit on the inside, and they were pewter service plates and pewter candlesticks.  I collect pewter.  I had just bought a pewter tureen which was just 17-something.  So I think we had to have a soup.  But we planned the meal and Jane did some things and I did some things, and we did Naomi Barry’s malfatti, made with ricotta and spinach, and I think we did lamb and chocolate velvet and chocolate truffles, chocolate velvet with half whipped cream and half sour cream, to approximate crème fraiche, which I don’t think existed in New York at that time.\nHe sat on the window seat, taking up two spaces, and the end of the meal, we looked at him and he said, “Well, that was the richest meal I’ve ever had.”\nI thought, “Oh, god, we really impressed him.”  And then afterwards I realized that wasn’t necessarily a compliment.\n\nQ:  I noticed that in your book, that he would say nice things about you that, upon reflection, you weren’t sure were so nice afterwards.\n\nGreene:  Well, that one, that was a good compliment, and of course I realized it wasn’t.  I don’t know.  I don’t remember.  I’d have to look at the book.\n\nQ:  I was just curious about that kind of approach and his personality.\n\nGreene:  Well, for people doing a story to get a quote, he said very positive things, and then in gossip, who knows.  He was known to be a brilliant rapier gossip, and I’m sure that’s what was going on in the kitchen besides eating and cooking.\n\nQ:  How did you figure out who else to ask to the dinner?\n\nGreene:  I don’t remember who else was there.  I have a book.  Maybe we signed the book.\n\nQ:  You had a guest book?\n\nGreene:  Yes, I have, or had, a guest book.  I learned that from Craig Claiborne.  When I was doing the story for Look magazine, he showed me his guest books, which everybody signed, and he would have the menu, and often if the famous Italian friend of Craig, who was an artist and wrote cookbooks too, as a result of knowing Craig, he was able to start being a cookbook writer, he would illustrate them, and they were so beautiful.  Craig said, “My accountant told me I should do this so that I have proof of all these business expenses.”\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  This is the next continuation…[of Gael Greene interview].\n\nGreene:  On Monday I looked at the article to see who to call, and I looked in the phone book and I dialed Meals on Wheels, which was a center on the Upper East Side, and their line was busy, so I looked at the article again.  It said the Department for the Aging, so I called and asked for the press attaché, naturally, being a reporter, newspaper writer, whatever.  That was my first thought.  And on the phone came Helene Wolfe, a woman I knew from the Michigan Daily.  I said, “Helene!  My god, it’s me and it’s you.”  I’m so sorry, I don’t remember if it was 30 or 35,000 dollars and 600 chickens that we raised over the weekend to help bring weekend meals to those people that were written about in the paper.  I said, “The only this is, I don’t want a single dime to come out for a stamp or a phone call.  Everything I’m going to give you—.”\n\tNo, sorry, sorry.  I said, “Helene, this is me, and we have raised this money over the weekend.  I want to give it to the Department for the Aging.”\n\t“Just a minute,” she said.  “I’ll put the commissioner on the phone.”\n\tSo Janet Sainer, commissioner of the Department for the Aging, came on the phone.  She said, “Oh, I’m so happy you raised all this money.”\n\tI said, “Well, the most important thing, everyone is very concerned about charities that are spending more than they’re giving to the cause that they expound.  So not a dime of this money should come out for a stamp or a phone call.  We want everything to go to Meals.”\n\tShe said, “Don’t worry.  We have our own administrative expenses from the city, and we will make sure that your money goes only for meals.”  So it was agreed.\n\tWe sent the money and then we found out that 6,000 people had had a Christmas meal who would not have had one, using our money, and everybody was so excited and moved and very, very happy about it.  A few of us said, “Let’s organize.  We have to get those Saturday and Sunday meals.”\n\tSo James and I, we were put in touch with somebody at City Meals, who turned out to be Marcia Stein.  She was assigned the task of making sure we weren’t crazy, and helping direct our energies.  We organized and used their tax deduction number, the department’s number.  They had a special number for private donations, and we became maybe the first public/private organization in the city.  Mayor Koch was totally thrilled, and he would send us money.  When he got small fees for giving a speech, he would always send them to City Meals.  We had a Friends board, and many of the people who had given at the first round became Friends of City Meals.  They brought in others who were in the food world as suppliers or a grocery store, and very quickly both Lew Rudin and Bob Tisch came on the Friends board, and their involvement gave us the instant whatever that word is—\n\nQ:  You mean credibility?\n\nGreene:  Instant credibility.  We set about raising money, and we gave our first party at Club A, a cocktail party.  I think at that time maybe Alfred Portale was in the kitchen.  Adam Tihani had designed it.  Roberto Amaral from Brazil was the owner.  We raised $50,000.  We were like so proud of ourselves.  I remember Joel Gray was there; he was one of the original people, big foodie.  And Janet Sainer said to Joel, “Joel, would you sing something?”  It was like who knew that this was like the worst sin you could do with a performer, but Joel was very benign about it, and he sang “Money.”  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Let me take you back for a second to your calling James Beard.  You called him in part because you knew he had a lot of products that people gave him, but why else?  Did you think that he would have a network that he could tap into?  Why did you call him rather than—\n\nGreene:  Because of the products.  The old Christmas baskets.  How do you fill Christmas baskets?  Well, James Beard has all these products that he is involved with, and that could be the beginning, and then we’ll go on from there.  That only started raising money.  He instantly brought in Barbara Kafka, and I think she made probably a lot of the phone calls.  I never got off the phone myself all weekend.  I’m sure I went out to dinner.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Of course you went out to dinner.  Did he continue in any way to be active in the—\n\nGreene:  Oh yes.  Yes, he came to meetings.  He had ideas.  He gave us ideas for raising money.  I don’t know.  Marcia will remember.\n\nQ:  But you have continued to be very active.\n\nGreene:  And also the relationship between James when he was ill, and I would visit him in the hospital, I remember his saying, “They want me to give up salt and fat.”  And he said, “If you can’t eat, what reason is there to live?”  But he survived again and again.  Larry Forgione became very close to him and apparently spent a lot of time with him in the hospital, absorbing Jim’s ideas about food and being there for him.\nSo when Harvey Baldwin and I went to California to go to Wolfgang Puck’s first Meals on Wheels benefit at Spago in the parking lot where Wolfgang had gathered forty California wineries and some great chefs from all over the country, I said to Larry and Jonathan Waxman, who were the two New York chefs, “Gee, we could do this in New York and we could charge more money.”\nSo they said, “Okay.  Great idea.”  And we decided it would be the eighty-second birthday party of James Beard, and Jim agreed that would be great.\nHe then became ill and died, I believe in February.  The party was in June.  I don’t remember whether it was he or how we came to go to Nick Valenti and the man who was the president of Restaurant Associates at that time, whose name is escaping me, but they agreed that we could use their space and they would close the three restaurants for the night and the day, I guess after lunch, maybe, and all the chefs could do their prep work in those kitchens.  Restaurant Associates had, and have, an amazing catering team, the absolute army of catering, and they helped our special events person organize the event and produce the event, and it was a huge success.\nAfter Jim died, Larry and Jonathan agreed it would be a celebration of Jim, and we invited all the chefs who were known as his protégés, so there was Edna Lewis and—god, I can’t think of his name.  Felipe Riojas.  A lot of them did pig and barbequed pig, so there were three kinds of pig at this first City Meals event in Rockefeller Center Garden, and I thought, imagine Jim hovering overhead, laughing at how silly and wonderful, since pig was his favorite food.  Edna Lewis did a great ham, and Felipe did a suckling pig.  Someone else did it.  Mark Miller was there.  We had Seppi Renggli from the Four Seasons, who was very close to Jim, and of course Larry and Jonathan invited the chefs who came, because they were asked by them.\n\nQ:  Could you raise more money making it in honor of James Beard than you might have otherwise?\n\nGreene:  Well, it gave it the focus of “This is about food,” and it was the first, other than the Gourmet Galas, which were celebrities cooking on the floor in ballrooms.  In fact, James Beard was one of the judges at the first Gourmet Gala, where I won with my—I was the only professional cooking, and I realized that and I thought, “Oh, this is really ridiculous and puts me on the spot here.”  But I had an extraordinary recipe that André Soltner had helped me do, of duck slightly pink inside with a Madeira reduction sauce and figs.  I didn’t know how to carve it, but somebody right next to me, who I wish I could remember—he and his wife were another cooking team, she was a model—he knew how to carve, so he carved this duck so exquisitely.  The figs were made into flowers and there were dried figs and there were the fresh figs, and the plate looked so wonderful.  I think James Beard and Craig Claiborne were among the judges, and they chose my dish as the best dish.\nSo that was the only other food event of that kind, and we were the first to bring celebrity chefs into groups.  We had done it at the Gotham.  We started with the power lunch at the Gotham.  No, we did a dinner auction at Perigord.  I’m trying to remember if we had guest chefs at the Perigord.  We did have guest chefs when we did our auction at the Gotham, and the Gotham, Jerry Kretchmer was a friend.  Maybe he was one of the early supporters.  I asked him if we could do the event, and he said, “Yes, we can hold 225 people.”  He had just brought in a new chef, Alfred Portale, and we didn’t know anything about him, and we were concerned that he would not be able to do a fabulous dinner, so we said, “We’ll have all these chefs and each one will do a course.”  So we had André Soltner.  I don’t remember who else, but I remember André said he would do the dessert, so he didn’t have to leave the restaurant during the dinner hour, because he was notorious for never leaving Lutèce.  He would just come at the end and take a bow, and the dessert would be all ready to serve.\nAlfred would coordinate all the chefs.  Later Alfred turned out to be Alfred.  I was the first to write about how wonderful he was, because I remember Jerry Kretchmer said, “You know, by the way, Alfred is really wonderful.”\nI said, “Oh, yeah?”\n“Oh, his food is so good, not like anything we’ve ever had.”\nI said, “Well, all right.”  I came in, of course, anonymously one day, but not anonymous after I got there, and I came a few times and the food was really special and very good, so I wrote about it, and shortly thereafter, the Times came.\n\nQ:  These events were for City Meals on Wheels?\n\nGreene:  The dinner auctions that we gave, the items we auctioned, unbelievable trips in France, dinners with the chefs, going to the market with the chefs, having a lunch with the crew, incredible food, mostly food- and travel-oriented items, mostly arranged by Yanou Collart in Paris, and fulfilled by her.  Huge million-dollar work over the years, millions of dollars probably raised.  People always paid more than the trip was worth, which was interesting, because most charities that did auctions, they would often buy something wholesale and sell it and make a profit, but I thought that our trips were so special that people seemed to be paying more than the trip would cost if they did it themselves.  However, they would not be able to do it themselves, because the add-ons were priceless.\n\nQ:  How long did you stay on the board?\n\nGreene:  I am on the board.  I’m the chairman of the board.  Briefly James and I were co-chairs of the Friends board from the beginning, and I’m still the chair.\n\nQ:  We can save all of the discussion of New York Magazine for another time.\n\nGreene:  Yes.  I have things to do.\n\nQ:  Thank you very much.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tGreene 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n","description":"Gael Greene, the New York Magazine restaurant critic, knew James Beard casually when an article in The New York Times brought them together. The piece described the plight of impoverished senior citizens who received food aid from the city during the week, but had no source of food on weekends and holidays.\r\n\r\nThe situation appalled her, and she was inspired to call everyone she could think of who might have money or goods to ameliorate the situation.\r\n\r\nJames Beard was one of those people. It was common knowledge that food companies often sent Beard samples of their products in the hope that he would try them, like them, and, with luck, promote them in his columns.

Massive and abstruse pieces of federal legislation that are reworked every five years or so, the farm bills are little understood but enormously influential on food and farm related subjects from food stamps to commodity crops to conservation and trade.\r\n\r\nActivist speaker, writer and publisher Dan Imhoff illuminated that world for the lay public (and perhaps also for members of Congress) in his 2007 book, Food Fight: The Citizen's Guide to a Food and Farm Bill.\r\n\r\nThis Interview tracks over Imhoff's childhood in York PA, his education, his travels in Asia and Europe after college, some of important influences in his thinking about the environment (including a businessman who later became his father-in-law), his interest in a variety of environmental issues, and his life in Northern California, where he and his wife have a small farm that provides much of the food for their family.\r\n\r\nWith the recent publication of CAFO: The Tragedy of Industrial Animal Factories, Imhoff took on the increasingly contentious world of American meat production. He is currently at work on a revised edition of Food Fight.\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Dan Imhoff\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t           New York City\n\nDate:  April 14, 2011\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It’s April 14, 2011, and I’m speaking with Dan Imhoff in New York this morning.\nGood morning.\n\nImhoff:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we start, if you could tell me where and when you were born and something about your education, your family, growing up.\n\nImhoff:  I grew up in York, Pennsylvania, where I was born in 1959, and went to public school there.  My last year of high school, I went to the York College of Pennsylvania. \n\nQ:  What is that?  The York College of Pennsylvania?\n\nImhoff:  It’s a four-year college right down the road.  I was increasingly feeling penned in by the administration of high school, and even though my father was the president of the school board at the time—\n\nQ:  Especially.  [laughs]\n\nImhoff:  I had two older brothers in college at the time.  He let me take off that last year, and the agreement was that I’d just pass my classes and then I graduated with the rest of the class.  But that got me ahead, a year ahead, [and after that] I spent a year at Penn State.  Then I went on an abroad trip to Rome, through the Temple Tyler School of Liberal Arts and Art.  They had a program there.  I took one semester there.  That would have been the fall of 1978.  Then I ski-bummed in Utah until August of 1979, and I went to Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania.  I spent two years at Allegheny.  I was a  transferring junior.  I graduated from there, Allegheny College.  International relations was my major.\nI always wanted to be a writer.  My father and I were pretty much at odds that you could go to school to be a writer.  He was an avid reader.  He still is an extremely avid reader, though he’s going blind.  He was of the opinion that you went out and you had a useful, very interesting life and you wrote about it.  He didn’t know that there were all these amazing writing programs that were cropping up all over the country.\nSo instead I took international relations, I studied Spanish—it was the one thing I really learned coming out of college—and economics and history and poli sci.  I moved away from sciences.\n\nQ:  I saw from your Facebook page you went to Berklee College of Music first.\n\nImhoff:  No, I just went there on 2010 on a Sabbatical.  That was most recent.\n\nQ:  Oh, not first.\n\nImhoff:  I was trying to avoid the workforce.  I got offered a fellowship to do a master’s at the Maxwell School in Syracuse University, so I went there for two years again.  I was a South Asian Scholar.  [The funding] came from the National Endowment for the Humanities.  They wanted so many scholars in so many regions of the world as sort of a national defense mechanism, right?\n\nQ:  It’s a wonderful school.\n\nImhoff:  It was a wonderful school.  I really learned at that time that I didn’t want to become a pigeonholed academic.  When I got out of Maxwell in ’83, I was still a pretty young person.  I spent the next year in the Far East.  I spent four months in China with Columbia University in Shanghai on a program, and then I moved to Taiwan, was teaching English, making and saving money, learning Chinese, the old-fashioned system, Stanford system.  Then I spent a number of months that next year, the spring of 1984, just traveling all through China, Indonesia, Malaysia.  I really got a dose of the Eastern world. \nI had very little money and a backpack.  My dad said, “It’s really time to settle down.  You have a brother in San Francisco.”  I had a girlfriend at the time who was going to the Wright Institute of Psychology in Berkeley.  I moved to San Francisco, and I’ve really been a Californian, for the most part, since 1984.\n\nQ:  Let me just take you back a little bit.  When you were growing up, could you tell me about your family’s attitudes toward food and what that atmosphere was like when you were growing up?\n\nImhoff:  I came from a generation with nine boys.  There were four in my family and then I have five boy cousins. [No sisters or girl cousins]. It was a very close family.  My mom had no brothers and sisters; my dad had a sister and brother.  [My dad] lost his mother at a very young age, and my grandpa, his father, was really the patriarch of our family, and he was a great cook.  He had a second wife, and she canned everything.  You went over to their house and they had a beautiful Concord grape arbor and nice apple trees.  They lived in a little suburban area of York, Pennsylvania.  They traveled extensively.  But the holidays were really big, and food was really important.\n\tAt a certain point, my father has had a long illness.  He’s been not well for most of my teenage years on.  Cooking became therapy for him.  So my father, like his father, was the cook in our house, and he was really of the French Julia Child cooking school.  I mean, he would spend like days clarifying soup broth for these really extensive meals, right?  As we went on, he just became better and better.  He was a really excellent cook, and dinner was always a very important part of our household.\n\tI had some really dysfunctional eating habits growing up.  I really didn’t like fish.  Some things I really didn’t like.  As I read today, maybe it’s just because they weren’t good; the quality of the carrots weren’t good or the beets.  My mom was a big fan of beets, and I used to really not like beets at all, but you had to eat your food to go out and play.  I wanted to play, so there were some tough times there.\nSo food was very important.  My mom was really anti-pizza, because she didn’t consider that food.  You would never find things like American cheese or stuff in cellophane if you could help it.  We still lived just thirty miles from Amish country, so there were a number of vibrant farmers’ markets.  There still are.  My parents would go out and they’d seek out really good food, and my friends all wanted to eat dinner at our house because it was so good.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  I was going to say, that probably wasn’t all that common—and this is a terrible stereotype for me—in York, Pennsylvania.\n\nImhoff:  Well, my dad was really into cooking and he was really good.  There were things that weren’t part of their culture.  They weren’t wine-drinking people.  They thought Mateus wine was good, and Inglenook and stuff like that.  So things changed over time.  However, we weren’t wealthy people.  We were maybe slightly more than middle class.  My dad had a business; he employed lots of people.  We were just a family that was trying to find our way, you know, and food was a big part of it, good food.\n\tI, at an early age, kind of gravitated toward the growing of things and biology.  I really liked biology.  I remember just for fun, there was a greenhouse on the roof of the high school, and I got permission to go up there, and I was trying to raise gigantic tomatoes, because I’d learned about polysom.  I was trying to do some experiments [to see if I could grow unusually large] tomatoes. \n\tOne thing that really changed my attitudes toward food a lot—I think I was still at York College at the time—my brother handed me a copy of Diet for a Small Planet.  I was probably eighteen years old.  He decided that he was going to become a vegetarian.  So I read it.  It was very convincing to me.  It changed me.\nThen it suddenly lit a little bomb there in the middle of our family dinners.  My father, who was really French with all these sauces and extra heavy-duty things and meats, suddenly had some vegetarians to contend with.  You didn’t want to make a big deal, so you tried to be accommodating, but for the most part, that really sent me in this very—it’s been a meandering relationship with what kind of diet I felt right, made me feel good, etc., But for many years I was a vegetarian and either cooking for myself or, when I was at Allegheny, they had a dining hall that I was part of, and the vegetarians all took turns cooking for each other.  So you learned some things over those years as well.\nIt was really cool.  Instead of being at a dining hall, these folks long ago, far-sighted people, bought a house.  The money that you would pay for one semester’s worth of dining went to this house, this dining hall, and we hired our own cook and we bought our own foods.  A lot of the stuff came from the coop, and it was a really great place to eat in a real social club right on the campus.  It doesn’t exist anymore.  But while I was there, it saved me.  You know what I mean?\n\nQ:  I imagine Asia introduced you to different kinds of foods.\n\nImhoff:  I remember never, ever experiencing poverty like I really saw when I was in China.  So we’re in the summer of 1983.  I’m going to this school called the Shanghai Normal University.  We’re in foreign experts’ dormitories.  You still have the currency that is just for foreigners and you spend it in these stores that are just for foreigners, so you know you’re getting special food.  They would do the strangest things, like you would have fried fish that had lots of bones in it.  [laughs]  I mean, like why would you fry the fish with [bones in it]—but they were such unbelievable eaters, right?  They could pop a shrimp in their mouth and spit the shell out.  That all seemed somewhat magical to me.\n\tThen I had a bicycle. We all bought these Flying Pigeon bicycles, and every weekend I would put it on the train and go somewhere.  I remember picking the bike up one day and going back into the freight area of the train station, and there was the worker there—\n\nQ:  This was where?\n\nImhoff:  This would have been in Nanjing.  I can’t remember exactly, but Suzhou or somewhere, where we took the train to.  He had his little tin, because everybody got a tin, your allotment of rice, and the people who were in charge of the allotments of rice would put rocks in it so that they could take some for themselves, right?  So they would give them the right weight, but there were always a few pebbles in there.  He had his tin full of rice and a bone, and he would eat some rice and then suck on the bone.  I knew the bone was really the only flavor that he had.\n\tShanghai was still very much a three-story city.  People shopped every day, and they either rode their bicycles by the millions or they were on very crowded buses.  You would go by these corners, which were these dropoff areas, and one week there would just be this mountain of watermelons, and then the next week there would be this mountain of cabbage or lychee nuts.  It was never really super well coordinated, and you realized what these folks went through food-wise.  But they made it and they did it.  It was very eye-opening.\n\tThen, of course, from there I went on to Taiwan, Taipei, this free-market industrializing country in which food was way more available and the standard of living from a food perspective seemed higher, and you had a refrigerator.  You know what I mean?  Just everything really changed from that perspective.\n\nQ:  It was international relations in one way or another that you were studying?\n\nImhoff:  I was a generalist.  I was trying super hard to be a generalist, and that is really what international relations was.  I thought of going to law school.  As a matter of fact, I got into law school halfway through my master’s program at Syracuse.  Everybody had always told me, “You’d be a great lawyer.  You should be a lawyer.”  And I enrolled in Dickinson College of Law.  I still had the fellowship there at Syracuse as a backup plan, and I went there for two days and I just realized, “I’m not ready for this.  This seems like it’s going to be the end of my life if I do this.  Then I’ll be a clerk and then I’ll be a partner and then I’ll be dead.  My parents will have invested this big amount of money in this, and I’ll be obligated.”\n\tSo I went to the dean and I said, “Everybody seems really happy here except for me.”\n\tAnd he said, “Come back when you want, and we’ll refund your parents’ money.” \nAnd—boom—I went back to Syracuse, I finished up, and I kind of got out of—well, I didn’t totally get out of school, because then I went to this program in China.  Then I started to teach English.  So I was just sort of in limbo, not knowing what the world held for me.\n\nQ:  When was it that you had to start making some kind of living for yourself?\n\nImhoff:  As soon as I left that program in Shanghai.  So I went to Taiwan, I was teaching, studying.  I was really pretty much in charge of my finances.  Then I got back to San Francisco, and that was the spring of ’84.  I was in international relations.  I took the Foreign Service exam.  [Ronald] Reagan was the president.  It was pre-Iran Contra, but it wasn’t a foreign policy that I particularly felt super proud of or wanting to participate in.  There wasn’t a vibrant NGO community like there is now in San Francisco.  There was not the Rainforest Action Network or the Earth Island Institute or many of the other great NGOs that are out there for somebody like me who was somewhat public policy oriented.\n\nQ:  I’m not even sure I knew what an NGO was at that point.\n\nImhoff:  There were some, but they were more oriented toward promoting trade and things like this.\nSo I ended up working in business.  I ended up working for a shipping company first, and their M.O. was—it was a Chinese company, and they, on a monthly basis, sent containers back and forth to Tahiti.  They pretty much controlled the whole trade in Tahiti of commodity goods.  Things were constantly rusting in Tahiti, so they were constantly sending appliances and things back and forth, and grain for animals and things like that.  So I did that for a while.  I got fairly good at it.\n\tThen I answered an ad for a company called ESPRIT.  They were this really hip clothing company that employed lots of people, and it was sort of a lifestyle place to work.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you explain the ethos of ESPRIT?  Because I remember it, but sooner or later, people will have forgotten.\n\nImhoff:  It was a fashion company mainly for [women and] girls, but at the time it had expanded to many, many different countries.  It had a European wing; it had an Asian wing; then it had North America.  But we were probably in at least forty-some countries.  It was a billion-dollar business at the height of its success.  I don’t know where it is today necessarily, money-wise.  It was a place to work where they gave you a lot of perks, really good food in the cafeteria, no smoking in the building, really beautiful offices.  You were really encouraged to go out and participate in theater and artistic events and things like that.  There were kayak trips and outdoors things.  It was really to promote teamwork and pull the best out of everybody.\n\tI was in the shipping department, and at a certain point I became the Carnet expert.  A Carnet is what you have to file when you’re going on a tour.  Like if you’re a rock band, let’s say, and you’re touring around Europe, you have to have all the documentation that shows what you’re traveling with, and it gets presented at the Customs as you’re going through country through country.  So whenever there was something really complicated, it was my job to do in the international shipping department.  I was there for a year.\n\tAfter a year, you were allowed to apply to some other department.  There was a big international meeting, and I stuck my résumé into the mailboxes of a bunch of the visiting people who were in charge of other countries.  I was still thinking of international relations at the time.  The lady who was in charge of ESPRIT Italy was setting up a new headquarters in Milan.\n\nQ:  You hit the jackpot.  [laughs]\n\nImhoff:  She hired me.  My job was to just coordinate with the other companies in Europe.  Italy was producing a line of clothing, and these guys would do advanced orders, and I would make sure that their orders came through and their money came through, and settled their accounts.  I was no accountant by any means.  I was just doing this job, really, to be in Italy.\n\tMilan was really not my [kind of] city, and every weekend I would get on a bus and go somewhere and ride my bike or ski or whatever.  One time I rode my bicycle around Sicily.\n\nQ:  It’s not an outdoor city.\n\nImhoff:  It’s not, and it was really hard to just be fit.  But I was an athlete.  I was a squash player.  I’d learned squash at Syracuse.  The owner of the company, of the whole company, was a squash player, and so when he would come to town, he would always want to play me, to just get some exercise.  We were kind of compatible.  I got to know him, and he is my father-in-law now.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  You really got to know him.\n\nImhoff:  Yes.  It took a little while.  I had no idea that would ever happen, but along the twisted way, anyway, we met and we stayed in touch.\n\nQ:  Was his daughter working in Italy?\n\nImhoff:  No, his daughter was in college.\n\tSo I spent that year in Italy.  That certainly influenced my understanding of food.  Again, that was a deep food culture.  I was really beginning to get this feeling like, “Shoot.  I’m getting older.  I’m working a job that’s not really what I want to be doing.  I really want to be a writer.”  I started to just teach myself how to write, and I have to say I don’t think I was very good.\n\nQ:  How did you do that?\n\nImhoff:  I just started reading books, started writing stories, taking little assignments.  I’d maybe been doing it before.  Now I was pushing harder.  I had been doing it before.  I take that back.  I took some playwriting classes while I was still working in San Francisco.  I started that process of educating myself.  I had a typewriter and a teletype roll like [Jack] Kerouac, and I typed [Ernest] Hemingway’s—what’s the fantastic story where the hunters are out and the wife—The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.  I typed that story word for word.  I did all kinds of things to try to get myself to really learn what it was to be a writer.\n\tAfter the one year at ESPRIT in Italy, I’d taken this really long bike trip through the Alps, and I came back and I said, “Okay, now I’m going to learn how to do it.”  And I became a temp.  I took temp jobs for a couple of years, and I went to San Francisco State’s [graduate English program]. The idea there was I was going to be a fiction writer, and I worked on fiction writing pretty hard.  You know what I mean?  I’m a disciplined person.  I don’t mind solitude.  I really worked at it.  So I really began the process of figuring out how to be a writer, and it was very much through the back door.  I didn’t go to [a] journalism class or anything like that.\n\nQ:  That is, of course, what you’re describing, the way to do it, and very few people commit themselves to doing that.\n\nImhoff:  I often wonder if it was a very legitimate way to figure it out, because there was no one to really show me, and I spent a lot of time on things that I never finished.  I was working on a novel, and I’d spent a good amount of time on it, really, really trying to crack the code on making this work.  It was about an oil spill that hits the northern California coast, where I was living and exploring and it was really becoming my home.  It happened before the Exxon Valdez hit.  It was a cool, prescient thing that I was working on.\nAnd comes back into the picture this guy that I used to play squash with in Italy.  He wanted to play squash, so we were playing squash one day, and he says, “Hey, what are you working on?”  I’d published some articles like in airline magazines and local places, and they were all about the outdoors and conservation-oriented-type things.  He was into them.  He said, “Hey, I’ve got this job for you.  It won’t take long.  It’ll be like half-time for a couple of months, then you’ll be done.”\nHe was increasingly concerned about the environmental impacts of his company, of ESPRIT, and the whole fashion business and the whole point of creating consumer demand that didn’t really exist, and he was a master at it.  So my first job was to write down all the impacts of washing your clothes, and it would go on a hangtag on all the garments, and just say there’s these phosphates in the detergent, there’s huge amounts of water and electricity that often affects habitats and ecosystems, and then there’s electric drying that’s not necessary.  You can dry your clothes on the line.  Blah, blah, blah, right?  However many, we had fifty words or something to say all this.\nThen it became a series of hangtags that said “Stop and think, before you buy this, whether or not you really need it.  There are 6 billion people in the world, and clothing requires huge amounts of resources and materials.  When you’re done with it, consider passing it on.”\n\nQ:  See, it’s that kind of thing that I remember about ESPRIT.  It did catch your attention at that time because it was quite unusual.\n\nImhoff:  Yes.  Then we started taking out ads in Utne Reader that said it was a plea for responsible consumption.  I mean, look.  I became like persona non grata within the company, really, among the marketing people.  The last thing they wanted on their garments was something that says “Don’t buy it.”  Right?  But Doug Tompkins, who was the owner at the time, I mean, he also knew that that reverse psychology probably wouldn’t backfire, that people would even really appreciate that.  I mean, it worked from a PR standpoint.\n\tThen at a certain point my job was to work with designers, and we designed a little catchy slogan for little kids’ t-shirts that said something about “Seals, dolphins, and whales,” and then there would be these cool pictures, but there’d be a patch on the shirt that said something about marine life, and a dollar of every unit would go to—now there were NGOs in San Francisco.  The Earth Island Institute was going, and there was this whole world that was opening up, and my job was to do cause-related marketing for that.\nAt a certain point I learned about how pesticide-intensive cotton production was, and so I had some articles, I gave them to Doug, and again he was unafraid.  He just put those articles—bang—right on the bulletin board right as you walked into the design studio of ESPRIT, which was really like this incredible temple, this redwood, glass, all these people working on these cool artistic design projects.  So I would just go around to all the designers, saying, “Hey, let’s just make one organic garment.  I mean, what’s the point of making these t-shirts that are supposed to have environmental messages, but they’re not made out of environmentally preferable cloth?” \nSo one of the designers, a lady named Linda Gross, she is from England, really kind of an intellectual designer, she really got it.  So the two of us started to develop a team, and we eventually started a whole line and a whole project, a five-year research project, where we just really got into the environmental impacts of clothing production.\n\nQ:  So this job lasted a little longer than a couple of months.  [laughs]\n\nImhoff:  So there went the novel, right?  And at a certain point there was a change in ownership in the company.  I thought, “Great.  I’m going to get laid off and I’ll go up to Alaska.”  The Valdez had hit.  “I’ll finish the novel.  I’ll go up there and I’ll work.”  But they kept me working.  At the time, I was kind of a struggling writer for so long, it felt good to have something that felt meaningful, that used my skills.  But I was no longer writing my novel, and I was really writing less and less.  That then took my life in a whole different direction.\n\nQ:  What direction was that?\n\nImhoff:  Well, I mean, I was no longer a temp, you know.\n\nQ:  That’s important.  [laughs]\n\nImhoff:  Writing half-days, like really living to write, and instead I was doing this job.  The job was really looking at the environmental impacts of business, from a business perspective, from a design perspective.  The amazing thing was that because we were of a certain-size company, we had access to almost anybody we wanted.  We could go into spinning mills.  There were still some textile mills in 1990 in North Carolina.  We could go into the factories where they electroplated rivets.  They would electroplate the zippers and the rivets and the snaps and things for jeans with cyanide solutions.\n\nQ:  Why is that?\n\nImhoff:  Because basically what you’re doing is you’re taking a cheap metal and you’re plating it with a more expensive metal, and what makes that transfer possible is this electrolysis, and cyanide is a part of it.  You’re in this factory where you can feel the metal in the air, and everywhere there are these warning signs that if you get anything in your eye, just wash it out.  So we really had access to every single aspect, from the dying to the threads to the agricultural production of the fibers.  We were in California at the time California had over a million acres of cotton.  A million acres is like 1.2 times the size of Yosemite National Park.  It’s a huge amount of cotton in the Central Valley that is a very arid state, for the most part, right?  It’s heavily irrigated, heavily sprayed.\nThat really began my research into agriculture, studying agriculture, conventional agriculture, and writing about it, and I spent a long time writing about cotton.  I had some great stories.  I was still thinking, “All right, now I’m going to be like the ten-thousand-word writer and conventional ag is going to be my subject.”  Gosh, you know, you would get to a certain point at the few magazines that would even publish such a thing, and they would say, “Everybody knows about the problems with conventional ag.  It’s an old story.”  I mean, for me it certainly wasn’t.\n\nQ:  Everybody didn’t know.  Everybody still doesn’t know.\n\nImhoff:  No, and I have to say I was using all my creative writing skills to really try to write creative nonfiction, which some people do pretty well now today.  I spent a lot of time on those types of stories. \n\tMy father-in-law had gone on from ESPRIT and he had moved to South America.\n\nQ:  Were you his son-in-law at that point?\n\nImhoff:  I wasn’t his son-in-law until 1994.  So he left in 1990, I stayed on at ESPRIT.  His daughter, Quincey, came in at a certain point and we met there.  Eventually we got together through a lot of common interests, and in 1994 we were married.  But she didn’t stay at ESPRIT long.  She went with her dad, and her dad started a foundation called the Foundation for Deep Ecology.  That’s a whole story unto itself.\nOne of their funding areas was agriculture, and one of the people that they were very interested in working with was Wes Jackson from Kansas, who has been working on perennial polyculture for a long time.  So this is 1990.  This is twenty-some years ago.  Wes is maybe ten or twenty years into his program, where he’s trying to produce perennial grains, perennial polycultures of grains that you would not have to plow season after season, but they would, rather, be these mixtures of compatible plants.  It would be like an edible prairie that you could just go through at certain times and harvest.  He’s still working on it.  We really got indoctrinated into the world of Wes Jackson, which is the problem of agriculture, not the problem in agriculture, and you got these broad conceptual ideas about where we are as a species with food production.\nThen we’d go to the Prairie Festival and hear people like Donald Worster, who’s a great historian, or William Catton or Wendell Berry or all kinds of inspiring people.  So the world was really opening up to me that there was this subject to write about and that was so important.\n\nQ:  That was pretty early in the country’s consciousness of it, wasn’t it?\n\nImhoff:  They seemed to know.  When you read The Unsettling of America, I think that book was written in 1970….  Wendell Berry had an amazing critique of the system at that time.  I remember it being one of the super profound books that I ever read up to that time.  I’m sure if I picked it up today I would feel the same way.  So that critique was leveled pretty early on.\n\tThey opened me up to this whole group of scholars who was like-minded.  Our son, who’s now sixteen, in our little house in Bernal Heights in San Francisco, took his first steps at one of the very early meetings of the International Forum on Globalization, and Vanda Nashiva was right there to see it.  We suddenly had this gateway to a lot of ideas that were coming together, and globalization was just starting to get on people’s consciousness.  It was becoming like a real formalized intellectual movement.  The Foundation for Deep Ecology was right there at the inception, funding these groups and this type of thinking.\n\nQ:  Were you still trying to write professionally?\n\nImhoff:  I was working at ESPRIT, so I had my job to do.  I was kind of like the international communications research guy, and we had this line that we were putting out.  They were really pretty good to me, but there were a few things going on.  Life was moving.  I wasn’t getting much further ahead as a writer.  I was a copywriter, right?  I was pretty good at it.  I did my best to learn how to do it.  I probably would have been way better at a company like Patagonia, that was more about outdoorsy clothes than it was about women’s fashion.\n\nQ:  I don’t know.  I think one of the things about your writing is its clarity.  What you’re describing forced you to have a kind of clarity in your writing that some place like Patagonia might not have.\n\nImhoff:  Well, it was just a game, right?  I mean, you just had these levels of information.  When you’re trying to get somebody to buy clothing, especially—and this is just probably off-the-chart kind of a comment—women, when they’re buying clothes, they’re not really thinking about the impact of the pesticides on birds due to the cotton.  They’re thinking, “How does this make me look and how is he or she going to perceive me in this thing?”  Right?  This garment.  You have a very short amount of time to get that kind of information across.  So we would do everything we could.  We’d use photographs.  Then you had like a catchy little title, then some kind of subtitle, then text.  Everything was short and clear, and you did what you did.\n\tNow, at a certain point, my boss, this great lady, said to me one day, “Dan, I have this new assistant for you.”  She was this gorgeous woman from Dartmouth [College], just graduated from Dartmouth, just landed in San Francisco, and really, really clever.  Her name’s Heidi Julavits, and she’s now a pretty famous novelist, teaches at Columbia [University], and one of the founders of the Believer magazine.  It was great to have somebody to really bounce things off, and she had a lot of energy and just words spilling out of her.  So it kind of became I’m the fact guy and she’s the creative person.  We worked these things through, but it was a discipline.  It was definitely not a journalistic discipline.  You want to get things right, so you have to learn how you do that, right?  I’ve sort of developed my own technique to do that.\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nImhoff:  Hemingway always used to say that everybody needs a bullshit detector, and I think what he was really talking about was whether or not what he was writing about was believable.  For my job, really my bullshit detectors are experts that I can go to to review something, to make sure that my facts are right.  So I’ve really come to lean on a system of those types of people.  You work hard at trying to get things right.\n\nQ:  So how long did you stay there?\n\nImhoff:  I stayed until 1995, and it just became really clear to me that what we were doing in this particular development line, the special experimental line, was not going to trickle down.  It wasn’t going to become the product line.  And we were so far ahead of our time.  And it was time.  It was like, “Okay, I did this.  I can now go back to writing.”  I had no idea how hard that was going to be, being an outsider, being somebody who wasn’t in New York.  I was never a good freelance writer.\n\nQ:  You mean in terms of selling yourself and pitching?\n\nImhoff:  Yes, pitching and selling and—\n\nQ:  It’s a god-awful way of living.\n\nImhoff:  I mean, some people are really good at it.  I’m not.  I was not.  So I would fall back on things like copywriting because I could do it and make money, and then start working on other stuff.  I’d had that abandoned novel, and I don’t know whose words they were—again it might have been Hemingway—were very loud in my head, that basically it doesn’t matter what you start; it’s what you finish.  So I really decided that I needed to start finishing things.\n\tOne of the guys who I worked with at ESPRIT, Roberto Carra, this Italian photographer who’s maybe ten years older than me, he was a really good buddy of mine.  I love this guy.  We started to work together as much as we could on these environmental projects, and one of the first things we did was a book.  We were doing lots of things for other companies, and we wanted to use the right paper, but it was really hard to find information about the paper.\nSo we put together a book, and the idea was, it was a book that would really showcase the best recycled tree-free alternative papers, chlorine-free.  We went to an activist group and we said, “Look.  We want you to raise the money and then we’re going to print this book.  It’s going to be made for [graphic] designers.  The designers receive these expensive swatch books every day from the paper companies.  This is going to be for the good guys.  Then we want to send it to 10,000 designers free, to just try to promote the market for good paper.”  It was a total pain in the butt, and eventually we did find an organization to work with us on it, and—bang—we sent this book out.  So we became a de facto publisher.  It was such a cool book.  It was so novel.\n\nQ:  What was it called?\n\nImhoff:  It was called The Simple Life Guide to Tree-Free Recycled and Certified Papers.  It was just this tiny little book, but we managed to get twenty different types of paper in the back.  It was really nicely designed, so you could look through it and you could see how every page had six different objects printed on it in four color, six color, maybe, and you could just see how it was going to perform for your job, and all the right information was right on the back.  It was a really, really cool book.\n\tA couple of foundations at the time really understood, “Wow, this is neat.”  And we got funding to do a book on building, on finding alternatives to wood and building, and then packaging.  So we started a press.\n\nQ:  Were you at that point set up as Watershed Media?\n\nImhoff:  Yes.  Right around that time, we became Watershed Media.  There’s a really excellent man in Berkeley named Malcolm Margolin, who started Heyday Press, and Malcolm is a storyteller, he’s written a lot about Native Americans.  Anyway, he became a mentor to me.  He had Heyday for-profit, and then something like the Clapperstick Institute as a nonprofit, and he said, “You know, Dan, I’m always writing letters to myself as the president of Clapperstick to the president of Heyday, and some day they’re going to put me in jail.  Just become a nonprofit.  It’ll be way easier to do.” \n\tSo we became a nonprofit, and the model really was that we would produce these action-oriented resource campaign books that filled this need in a certain advocacy role.  So it started with the paper, right?  Let’s get the graphic designers to start getting the good paper.  Here’s one for architects and planners and designers to build a house with the best sources of wood or alternative sources of wood.  So that’s kind of how it started.  I think 2001 was officially when we started Watershed Media.\n\nQ:  How did you choose the title?\n\nImhoff:  You know, I don’t know, to tell you the truth.\n\nQ:  Was there a watershed you were particularly concerned about?\n\nImhoff:  No.  We liked watersheds, right?  We’re living in a watershed.  But it was more of a watershed event, that these types of publications could lead to some kind of a turning point of understanding.  That’s the ultimate goal there.\n\nQ:  Could you make a living this way?\n\nImhoff:  I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody.  I’ve had the luxury to not have to chase down every dollar.  I think you could.  You would spend a lot of time fundraising in order to do it.\nAs time went on, the challenge for the business model that I’ve described is that when we were writing about recycling and wood reduction and things in the early 2000s, that was a very bullish time.  There was a lot of money, the economy was good, and foundations seemed to want to put endless amounts of money into something like recycling, okay?  And I’m coming from the deep ecology perspective that says we’ve got to get to the root causes of environmental problems, and recycling seems to be sort of on the back end.  But, you know, we were able to pay ourselves a decent amount of money, more than we could have if we just sold the manuscript to a publisher.  Then we ran campaigns, and any money that we got back, because we were being distributed, we would just put into the campaign.  It went pretty well for a little while there.\n\nQ:  You were married at this point?\n\nImhoff:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Where were you living?\n\nImhoff:  We were married, and very soon after we were married, Quincey and I had a son.  We bought a little property up in the Anderson Valley, which is about two and a half hours north of San Francisco.  It’s kind of between the coast range and the Mendocino coast.  It’s a gorgeous valley.  We bought this place.  It was way up in the woods, had an A-frame house and this ancient orchard from the 1880s, a nice little bench of land and lots of woods, and we thought this is a place that we would come on the weekends.\nThe day before we were supposed to take title to this property, the house burned to the ground, and it was like a surgical removal of the house from the site.  So we ended up buying the land and then building a house, a much nicer house than an A-frame house, and everything that we learned from building that house went into the book Building with Vision [:Optimizing and Finding Alternatives to Wood] that came out in 2001.  That really informed the whole process of material selection and engineering a house, because it was off the grid.\nThen once we built this house, it was up there in the woods, we’d spent so much of our time every weekend, every waking minute we’d go up there, and we just decided to move there.  So we’re four miles up in the woods, off of Highway 128 outside of Philo.  It was a little isolated for my wife.  Then soon after, we had our second child.  When our second child was born, that’s when we moved up there full-time.  We sold the house in the city.  It was 1997.\nWe spent three years living up there, and that really became my first real experience with growing.  We had lots of apple trees there, built a big garden, and food production became really a big part of my everyday routine.  That was my lab.  We still own that place, and now it’s this fantastic little orchard carved out of the redwoods in Mendocino County.\n\nQ:  It was primarily an orchard?  You weren’t trying to grow all your own food?\n\nImhoff:  Well, no.  It was never trying to grow all our own food, but we were trying to grow a bunch of fruits and vegetables.  We probably have a couple hundred apple trees up there and then we probably have another hundred olive trees.  Then there’s a pond.  I started to raise chickens both for meat and for eggs, and dietary evolution and become a gardener.\n\nQ:  You were doing this and writing?\n\nImhoff:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Did you have a staff?\n\nImhoff:  No, I would just go down to the office every day in town and drop my son at school.  I mean, there’s a lot of time in the day.  I do have a worker who one day appeared.  He came with somebody who was putting in a trench of some kind.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  Okay.  So you have this worker.\n\nImhoff:  He came to help on a crew.  I think they were putting in a pipe for one of our water tanks, and he was just working on a Saturday or Sunday as a laborer.  The next week, on Sunday, he showed up at the gate and he asked me if I had anything to do.  Then the next weekend and the next weekend and the next weekend, and he just became, over time, a regular worker for our family, and he still works with me fifteen, sixteen years later.  We’ve been able to really integrate him into some different properties up there.  So he helped me a lot.\n\nQ:  And you lived up there for three years.\n\nImhoff:  Three years.  Then it was really evident that it was just way too small of a community for my wife, and we were really isolated and we had these kids.  We could see the future, which was if our kids wanted to have a pretty varied extracurricular activity, we would just be driving everywhere and really long distances just to play a baseball game, right?  You could spend all day just on one baseball game.\n\tSo we moved down to Healdsburg, which is in Sonoma County, which is about an hour away, and it was pretty much equidistant from San Francisco, where she grew up, and Mendocino.  Fortunately, we didn’t have to sell our place up in Mendocino, and I got there regularly.\nWe spent a few years in town in Healdsburg, and then we found this really outstanding property that’s outside of town on the west side, and it really offers closeness to town, which my wife likes, but a real sense of isolation, which I like, and it’s kind of a really, really nice compromise for the two of us.  It’s a gorgeous place and it’s only five acres.  There were a bunch of olive trees there.  I’ve really been able to incorporate lots of food production into my every day.  There was a horse barn that was already there that I turned into a livestock-producing facility, built a chicken coop, nice hen house, and then I have gardens, raised-bed gardens.  So there has been a lot of evolution here.\n\nQ:  What do you do when you get up?\n\nImhoff:  When I get up, well, I have a dog, we have an Australian shepherd, and she’s one of my main focuses.  Then I just go around.  If I have the chance, I will walk down the creek with the dog, and that really is a nice way to start the day.  It’s a beautiful live California creek, wooded.  Then I’ll just make my rounds and make sure all the animals and the plants are well cared for.  The chickens have to go out.  If we’re raising hogs, the hogs have to be fed.  If you have hogs, you don’t have too much compost.  Then you have plants, to make sure they’re happy, depending on the season, and you can pretty much raise food all year long.\n\nQ:  Do you have help?\n\nImhoff:  Well, I mean, not in the mornings, no, but once a week Eduardo comes down, the guy who we have from up in the Anderson Valley.  The neighbors have sheep.  The sheep can go into the orchard and keep the grass down there.  We try to have things on a pretty perennial system, so the maintenance is fairly reasonable.\n\nQ:  [Does your wife participate]?\n\nImhoff:  Yes, she participates, definitely, definitely.  I’m more the producer and she’s the cook.\n\nQ:  That’s definitely fair.\n\nImhoff:  Yes.  That’s changing a little bit now.  I mean, we’re doing these things now, where on any given years we’ll produce ten or fifteen gallons of olive oil, a couple hundred gallons of apple cider, seventy dozen eggs, some huge amount of eggs.  I try to raise a chicken a week.  I’ll do a spring and a fall run of twenty-five broiler chickens.  Then a couple hogs, depending.  And a great deal of veggies and fruits from the garden.  So it’s really becoming something that we look forward to and we’re getting better and better at, you know.\nSo when she doesn’t have any more chickens in the freezer, she starts to get upset that now we have to buy it, and we know we don’t really want to do that, and it doesn’t take us that much, so we start to look forward to it.  It is a really big organizing principle of what we do.\n\nQ:  What about slaughter?\n\nImhoff:  Eduardo and I do the slaughter, and we do twelve or twenty at a time.\n\nQ:  We’re talking chickens, I guess.\n\nImhoff:  We’re talking chickens, right.  It’s a rough day, you know.  A few of them are eaten fresh and then most of them are frozen, sometimes whole, sometimes half, sometimes in varying different ways that they’re prepared.  My wife really likes halves, boned halves, because that’s a good amount for us as a family.  So we got that one down.  We’re right now about to raise ducks, so I’m pretty excited about ducks. \n\nQ:  In the middle of all this, at what point do you get interested in the Farm Bill, perhaps the single most complicated piece of legislation that the government has to produce?\n\nImhoff:  I’m an advocacy publisher.  I go to a meeting in Sacramento in 2006, it’s put on by the Kellogg Foundation, and really all day long just panel after panel after panel of all these negative impacts that are related to the Farm Bill.  I’m already interested in the Farm Bill from a previous book, Farming with the Wild, where I’m really looking at serious conservation-based agriculture efforts around the country, and I’m fascinated by what can be done when Farm Bill dollars, conservation dollars, are well spent in order to preserve big cores of habitat.\n\nQ:  When was that book?\n\nImhoff:  That was 2003.  So I spent three years on Farming with the Wild, and it was kind of a big conceptual book.  It was really asking how wild can a farm be and still be productive economically to a farmer, and how much agriculture can take place in a wild way [or linkage] that’s supposed to have permeability across the landscape and still supply the biodiversity protection that the biologists need.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you describe what wild means.\n\nImhoff:  Wild, in that context, really meant wild in terms of natural cycles.  How can a farm be imbedded in a fully functioning ecosystem?  How can you have farming in an area that wants to cyclically flood?  How can you have ranching in an area which should cyclically have fire to regenerate the grasslands?  How can you have livestock or some other agriculture in an area where there are top-down predators like wolves and lions and bears?  How do you accommodate these sweeps of natural migration of birds moving from north to south every year?  So, wild meant really functional ecosystems in the way that Aldo Leopold would appreciate.\n\tThe idea really came from—because of the Foundation for Deep Ecology experience, these guys were involved in really big conceptual thinking with groups like the Wildlands Project.  You have these conservation biologists that were saying, look, we have—what’s the word for it?  It’s islandification of natural habitats, and we have our wildlands areas becoming more and more isolated, and the populations are starting to get cut off.\n\nQ:  Do you mean like mini ecosystems?\n\nImhoff:  Yes.  So what you had in big wildlife areas was that they were very isolated and surrounded increasingly by agriculture, industrial agriculture, with no connectivity between them and no way for wide-ranging species to get from one place to the next and intermix and [maintain] healthy populations..\nThen I saw the sustainable ag community, they were really focused on trying to just figure out nonchemical agriculture, but somehow if the biologists were going to succeed in creating connectivity on the land and the sustainable ag practitioners were going to really have high quality of life, the two of them had to come together.  They needed each other, but really they weren’t talking to each other.  At times they perceived each other as enemies.\nSo Farming with the Wild was really this attempt to go across the whole landscape and say, look, what are the best examples around the country of these places where conservation and agriculture come together?  It was a great book.  At one point I called up Randy Gray.  [He] was the head biologist at the NRCS, the UDSA Natural Resource Conservation Service.  He was in charge of all the NRCS biologists in all the fifty states.  Randy completely got the concept, how good this would be of a publication—not “could”—get the word out about the good things that the Farm Bill does.\nHe wrote an e-mail.  We were e-mailing them.  He wrote an e-mail to the fifty head biologists and said, “We’re looking for the best projects.”\n\nQ:  You mean one in each state?\n\nImhoff:  Yes.  They wrote me back.  A whole bunch of them wrote me back, and then it was really a matter of affordability.  We went down to Florida.  There were some really good things going on in Florida, but the agriculture wasn’t really up to snuff, so it was kind of a lost trip.  But then we went down to Texarkana and we saw some great wetlands reserves going on.  So what I really saw was, wow, what a public benefit the Farm Bill can be when it’s really applied to conservation, because that’s the thing that the market doesn’t pay for.\n\nQ:  Do you have any recollection when you first knew what the Farm Bill was?\n\nImhoff:  Yes, I think I was reading articles about conservation programs, and I just started to put it in the file, hey, this is really interesting.\n\nQ:  This would have been when?\n\nImhoff:  This was probably late nineties.  I knew about subsidies to cotton growers because I was really pretty deep into that subject for a while, but I didn’t have the full grasp.  Then you got into it.  By the time Farming with the Wild was done, I kind of figured, oh, wow, this is such a misguided bill, it doesn’t mostly bad, promotes mostly big industrialized agriculture, which I’d been completely steeped in since the days of visiting Wes Jackson.  Then on the back end, it takes a little money and tries to make Band-aids through its conservation programs.\n\tSo by the time I got to the Kellogg conference, it really heightened my worst fears about the bill, but I also felt, after the day, that these reformers [desperately] needed a translator.  You couldn’t understand what they were talking about, there was so much alphabet soup being spoken, and it was just really technical, and you got the feeling it was bad.  It was just such a high level of discourse that you thought, wow, it would be great if we could get the word out to the average person about how important this bill is and what an opportunity it could be if it was properly directed.\n\tSo most people thought I was crazy, including the board of Watershed Media, but I was just looking, as I’m always looking, for something that hasn’t been done, a resource that really is useful, that can add something to the movement, and I can kind of put my spin on it.\n\nQ:  Did Farming with the Wild do well in terms of sales?\n\nImhoff:  No.  I went around the country.  It basically launched this organization called the Wild Farm Alliance that’s still around today, going pretty strong.  It didn’t do poorly.\n\nQ:  The reason I ask, you do take on subjects that are not natural bestsellers, and also, in the case of the Farm Bill, where there’s a lot stacked against anybody trying to explain it with clarity.  So, in other words, how important was making any money off this effort?\n\nImhoff:  Well, I kind of consider myself a public servant, so I oftentimes feel like I’m a government employee that doesn’t get paid by the government.  I’m doing their job.  So I’m pretty dependent on the foundation community to really step up and understand the value of it.\n\nQ:  Is that what you do?  You do apply for grants?\n\nImhoff:  I do. That’s the model.  I didn’t finish what I was saying.  The shortcoming is that it’s the rare foundation that really considers book production activism, because they can’t get some kind of quantifiable outcome.  They can’t say, “Well, we protected so many thousands of acres because of your book,” or, “We converted so many landowners.”  It’s very hard to quantify.\n\nQ:  And foundations do like to quantify.\n\nImhoff:  They do.  In the old days of “Let’s just get people interested about recycling,” they didn’t care.  But foundations have had to pare down, and there’s a lot of competition for dollars now.  For some reason, even foundations who’ve invested lots of money in on-the-ground activism don’t understand the benefits of these types of communication projects.  But, see, I saw it all the way back when we would write the ad that got published in the Utne Reader, and then suddenly it got written about by every magazine across the country, every newspaper.  We got a million dollars of print off of one really well-done piece of communication.\n\nQ:  That said what?\n\nImhoff:  The plea for responsible consumption.  I saw how it works.  So when it came to something like Farming with the Wild, I knew it wasn’t going to be a best-selling idea, but the idea was, make people creatively salivate about the opportunity.\nSierra Club Books, they were the publisher.  I pretty much just went to them and said, “I’ll give you this book,” and they didn’t do a really good job of promoting what an incredible book it was.  But that being said, we printed 8,500 copies. It’s almost out of print.  So it didn’t do poorly.  Truth be told, serious people who really care about permaculture sustainable agriculture, eco agriculture in its many forms, still go back to that book.  To me, there’s nothing I can add to it.  If someone asked me about what’s really good in agriculture today, I’d have to say, “Well, where?  What’s the goal?  Check out Farming with the Wild.  There’s fifty different profiles in there of people in different areas of the country trying to achieve different goals.”  They haven’t really changed.\n\nQ:  I didn’t mean that it wasn’t valuable; I just meant that as I said, you took on subjects that weren’t natural bestsellers.  You must have had a sort of optimistic hope somewhere that you could achieve something.\n\nImhoff:  You know, the idea has always just been be true to the subject matter in my own way.  Let’s talk about a successful model to deal with that kind of topic.  Farming with the Wild came out in 2003.  [The] Omnivore’s Dilemma [:A Natural History of Four Meals, by Michael Pollan] came out in 2008 or something like that, right?  I profiled Joel Salatin in Farming with the Wild.  The thing about the more conventional storytelling that’s demanded of a journalist is objectivity, right?  And you have to pretty much start from the point of view of “I don’t know what I’m going to find out.  I’m just going to find it out.”  You take people on a journey.  That’s not my model, for better or for worse.  So I’m pretty much starting from the point that I’ve done this study and this is what I know, and here it is.  Farming with the Wild was very much like I had a camera, very much of a travelogue that then layered in the ecological information in certain places.  So I’ve taken on these subjects that definitely aren’t bestsellers and they’re just the things that came to me, the opportunities that came to me, and I tried to be true to them the best that I could.  It’s not a winning formula for—\n\nQ:  For supporting your family.\n\nImhoff:  Yes.\n\nQ:  But as it happens, the Farm Bill book has done, it seems like, extraordinarily well.  Tell me how and when you decided to do that.\n\nImhoff:  You know, I just said, “Hey, let’s do it.”  There was a very short turnaround between that conference in January of 2007, when it really had to come out to have any influence at all.  I just did it on a wing and a prayer.  It wasn’t really well funded.  The groups that should have funded it didn’t see the value in it, so I just put it together.  It was a very naively ambitious thing to do.  The Farm Bill is about as complicated as it can be, and I thought, “I can do it.  I know a little bit about it.”  And it was hard work, nine months putting the whole thing together.\n\nQ:  That is really fast.\n\nImhoff:  It was really fast, and it was really just a very superficial look at agriculture policy and food policy.  As I look back on it right now, because I’m doing the second edition, it was mostly right.  Luckily, it was shallow, but the humbling thing is, when you write a thing like that, you really start to learn what you don’t know as soon as it’s published.  Then people are starting to call you an expert and asking you some really, really challenging questions, and then what happened was the Farm Bill debate dragged on for two years, so I probably did forty-five or fifty events over that period, and that’s when the learning process really started for me.\n\nQ:  You call it shallow, but on the other hand, it would have been very hard for a lay person to read if it had been more dense than, in fact, it is.\n\nImhoff:  That was the thought at the time.  I was trying to—how do you make the Farm Bill sexy, right?  The only sexiness in it for me is in the history of it, at least from a literary point of view.  I don’t think that’s true anymore.  I think as a writer you should be able to make almost anything interesting.\nFred Kirschenmann has been another really outstanding mentor to me in agricultural issues, and he wrote a really nice intro to Farming with the Wild, and when I had this idea at the Kellogg meeting, I asked Fred, “Fred, I got this idea.  I want to write this book about the Farm Bill, just to get people to build the literacy around it, political literacy.  Is it worth my time?  And I’m not talking about the money; I’m talking about the time and the mental energy it’s going to take.’\nAnd he said, “If you want to affect the 2012 Farm Bill, then it’s a good idea.”\nSo when I think about success of Food Fight [: The Citizen’s Guide to a Food and Farm Bill], it’s not how many copies we sold, because we didn’t sell a ton of copies—it’s out of print right now; it’s gone through three printings—but it’s that at the end, when the bill was signed, Nancy Pelosi said, “The Farm Bill used to be my least informed vote.  Now I know more about the Farm Bill than almost any other legislation, and it’s fascinating.”\n\nQ:  She knew about it because of the book?\n\nImhoff:  Because there was so much pressure put on her.  It wasn’t just Food Fight, but Carolyn Lochhead was writing front-page really good stories in the San Francisco Chronicle on farm policy.  The pressure was put on her.\n\nQ:  On Nancy Pelosi.\n\nImhoff:  Yes.  We reached millions of people.  Time magazine did a thing about Food Fight.  They just took things right out of the book.  Newsweek.  All of a sudden, people were becoming aware that this bill was, in fact, important and had these impacts beyond just this narrow belt of corn and soybean and commodity producers.  So it accomplished its goal, which was to build literacy around the importance of the money that we put into the food system.\n\nQ:  For the record, I think you could explain what Fred meant when he said if you want to impact the 2012 Farm Bill, the point being it was too late at that point to—\n\nImhoff:  Kind of, yes.\n\nQ:  It wasn’t the power of the book; it was just the timeframe.\n\nImhoff:  I think the timeframe was part of it.  The Kellogg Foundation had a number of different policy groups, and I was on a few of those calls.  Listening in, sometimes you just felt like, “Oh, gosh, this is already a done deal.  They’ve already made the deal and there is no way to impact it.”\nSo I think, though, what he was really talking about is something he continues to tell me, which is if we want to have change, we have to get to the urban areas.  We have to get to the populations of eaters that care.\n\nQ:  You mean readers in those areas?\n\nImhoff:  Yes.  We have to take our message to the cities.  And it happened.  I saw it happen.  The big challenge last time was that the health community did not weigh in.\n\nQ:  The health community meaning who?\n\nImhoff:  Doctors, the Centers for Disease Control, medical associations, nutritionists, the people with the most to gain from a healthy food system right now from a problematic point of view, with the obesity crisis that we face, they did not weigh in and say, “There’s a direct connection between human health and what we eat, and it’s not only what we eat, but how we grow it in a whole systemic function.”  And they are about to do it.  They heard the message; they just didn’t step up and use their power.\n\nQ:  It’s not a unified group either.\n\nImhoff:  Yes.  But they were the big missing voice.\n\nQ:  Right now, of course, it’s a different time both in terms of the issue being better understood and the resistance politically being there.\n\nImhoff:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Although at least—and correct me if I’m wrong—my understanding about the Farm Bill was that its support is regional rather than Democratic/Republican, that certain senators voted in terms of their states’ needs, rather than what their political alliance was.\n\nImhoff:  And they got slaughtered in 2010.\n\nQ:  “They” being?\n\nImhoff:  The Democrats that they were so careful to protect through this last very commodity-friendly Farm Bill.  There was one study, I think it was NRCD, National Resources Defense Council, but it could have been the Environmental Working Group, one of those two groups did a study that tried to show if we moved from commodity-heavy support to conservation-heavy support, how much more money would have gone into these new freshman districts, and it was astounding.  It would have benefited thirty new freshmen rather than just protecting the existing commodity structure if we’d gone toward conservation.  The benefits would have flowed to lots, lots, lots more local Democratic congressmen.\nBut then what happened was, okay, then they got this really status quo bill, and what happened in 2010, the Democrats got slaughtered.  It didn’t matter.  Didn’t help them at all.\n\nQ:  I see what you’re saying.  If you had to articulate a message that the book conveys, what would that be?\n\nImhoff:  The book shows that as far as land-based and health-based legislation, almost nothing is more important than the Farm Bill, and it’s a real bind that we’re in, because it’s this tremendous opportunity and this outflow of money to really serve the public good, and I think that agriculture is a public good.  However, misdirected, it’s one of the most damaging bills as well.  So it really matters where those monies are going and what types of food systems they’re perpetuating.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you articulate why it’s called Food Fight.\n\nImhoff:  Because it’s our money, right?  It’s a bill, and it’s basically this bill that’s trying to make everybody happy.  Right now there’s a process that the bill goes through and which is written, where there’s really two dominating political forces: the commodity groups that really represent lots of big corporate-like growers of corn and cotton, wheat, rice, soybeans, and then the hunger lobby, which is really trying to protect food stamps and supplemental nutritional programs, which are, in truth, just a wage supplemental policy.  They’re a policy for people who are having an increasingly hard time not being hungry because they’re not being paid enough.\nOver time, these two groups got into this quid pro quo arrangement where once the food stamp dollars were guaranteed, they would make a deal to make sure that the commodity prices were guaranteed, the commodity subsidies.  Those two groups really dominated the writing of the bill.  It’s not to say that there aren’t other things like conservation and resource and organic agriculture that are represented, but those are really the crumbs.\n\nQ:  A small percentage financially.\n\nImhoff:  Yes.  Most of the bill goes toward big production agriculture and nutrition assistance.\n\nQ:  At that point did you realize this alliance between the hunger lobby and the commodities?\n\nImhoff:  Quick.  As soon as I started studying.  Luckily, when you’re writing a book, there are a lot of people you can talk to.  However, it was more like a subtext in a conversation than the main text, and for me it was the main text.  It was kind of like there’s this whole conflict of interest, where the hunger groups want to protect the poor and make sure they get calories, but the calories that they’re supporting through the bill are really the wrong kind of nutrition for them, and they’re the most vulnerable to the foods that are highly processed and they’re high in solid fats from grain-fed animals and rich in sodium and things like that, right?  So to me, it just became this throbbing red warning light.  This is not good.\n\nQ:  In terms of your own farm and the community that it’s in, could you see any of this—I don’t mean necessarily the hunger lobby, but could you see the problems playing out in northern California?\n\nImhoff:  The things that I do on my farm, I’m really after creating the highest, highest quality of food possible for my family, and I realize what it takes.  So it gives me a sense of what goes into food production rather than this is how we could feed everybody.  What I see is a highly impractical critique, but the only way that we could ever have a really sane discussion especially with the climate that we have, there’s so much lobbying that goes on, there is really no campaign finance reform, so money talks, the only way that you can ever really have a sane dialogue about the food system in the Farm Bill is to separate the nutrition title from the commodity title and the land-based titles.  So talk about nutrition when you’re talking about the—\n\nQ:  The titles being, as it were, chapters of the Farm Bill.\n\nImhoff:  The chapters of the Farm Bill, the [different categories] of programs.  Talk about nutrition when you talk about the Child Nutrition Act, when you reauthorize school lunch spending.  That should be a separate discussion than what is grown on the land, how much, and what we pay for it and what we subsidize.\nIt just gets to the heart of the challenge of the USDA.  They have this twofold mission.  One, they’re supposed to give U.S. dietary recommendations, and they say, if anything, eat less meat, eat less dairy products, eat more fruits and vegetables and whole grains.  On the other hand, their mission is to support agriculture, and they support this very, very narrow band of foods that have nothing to do with their nutrition requirements.  So at some point they have to be broken up or they have to be really, really well integrated, and if the way the bill is written right now is a blackmail system, where—\n\nQ:  Explain that.\n\nImhoff:  Where the congresspeople and the hunger lobby who want the nutrition dollars will give anything they can just to keep that money going out, I totally understand that.  There are over 40 million people right now on food stamps.  The only thing they can do is make this deal with the devil, Big Ag.  It’s a broken system.\nSo the way I get around that is I start to think, okay, I live on the West Coast and I travel somewhat frequently up and down the West Coast, and I see this unbelievable burgeoning food movement, citizen food movement going on from Seattle all the way down to San Diego, not necessarily in the inland valleys, but certainly on the coasts, where there’s just an enormous population.  In California we passed this Animal Welfare Act, Prop 2, in 2008, Human Society-sponsored initiative.\n\nQ:  That says?\n\nImhoff:  That basically is going to affect the space requirements for hens in cages and outlaw gestation crates for hogs, which is where they keep female sows penned their entire lives, and veal crates.  The biggest impact in California’s going to be with the hen production.  But that is soon going to be considered in Washington and Oregon, and I can see it passing in both states.  I can see potentially animal-welfare standards passed in Washington, Oregon, and California.  I also see cities.  The city of Seattle has passed their own Farm Bill principles.  San Francisco did before.  Portland, Oregon, can’t be far behind.  And these are principles that we can all really get behind.\nSo then you start to think, wow, you have something really going on here on the West Coast.  What if there was a healthy food PAC that was very much MoveOn[.org] oriented, you got a million voters, people that are willing to vote with their forks and put in $20 and suddenly you had some real money to go to Washington and play the game?  I mean, the way it is right now, we have all the facts on our side, it seems like we have all the critiques and the analysis.  Believe me, this bill is unpopular with so many people, but they just feel like—\n\nQ:  You mean the existing Farm Bill.\n\nImhoff:  The Farm Bill, yes.  They just feel like we can’t compete with this huge agribusiness, they’re pouring so much money into the system, and it’s so true.  Well, then let’s fight back with some money.  Let’s play the game.\n\nQ:  Remind me how the bill is divided up.  Food stamps take up what percentage?\n\nImhoff:  Now it’s 70 percent.  I mean, that’s the sad—\n\nQ:  Seventy percent for food stamps only?\n\nImhoff:  Yes, for the nutrition programs, and that doesn’t even count school lunch.\n\nQ:  But it includes WIC [Women, Infants, and Children] maybe?\n\nImhoff:  Yes, WIC is in there.\n\nQ:  So that’s grown since the previous—\n\nImhoff:  It’s grown by 20 percent since when I wrote Food Fight, the first edition.  The scary thing is that there were 15 million on food stamps in 2001 and there are over 40 million people now.  So what’s wrong with this system that is supposed to give cheap food for everybody?  There’s so many more hungry people now than when we started this whole industrial agricultural experiment in the sixties, and [a high percentage] of them are overweight or obese.\n\nQ:  Then what percent goes to commodity farming?\n\nImhoff:  About 20, let’s just say.  So that leaves 10 percent or less for all those things with the public benefit, like conservation.  And believe me, whenever Big Ag can carve things out of conservation for them, like manure lagoons for CAFOs [Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations] and things like that, they do.  Research, marketing, foreign trade, energy, organic agriculture, those are some of the many other titles.\n\nQ:  You speak all over the place.  Do you have a sense of whether Americans have any idea about how much of their life the Farm Bill has an impact on?\n\nImhoff:  The fact is that it’s a pretty small amount of money, when you consider how important food is to life and to just the organization of society.  The USDA budget total, mandatory and discretionary, I think is still only two or two and a half percent of all spending.  It’s not a huge amount of money.  I don’t think they realize what the spending really sets in motion.  Most of the spending on the crops goes for things that we don’t eat.  Most of it goes to animal feed, and increasingly now it goes towards ethanol production.\n\tI was driving through Illinois a few weeks ago and I was going west and south of Chicago.  I’ve toured the Midwest in the past.  I was astounded by the amount of corn that’s being grown in Illinois.  I mean corn right up to the edge of the highway, right up to the edge of the farmhouses, right up against the edge of the development complexes, with no habitat in sight.  It seemed like the only way that farmers would leave any amount of wild area at all was if we paid them for it.\nWhat the Farm Bill has done is taken all the risk out of farming, out of commodity crop farming, so they don’t care.  I mean, they care, but if their yields go down, if the price goes down, we have all these supports to make sure that they’re going to make money in corn production.  The average farmer is not getting rich from it, right?  The costs of their production are going up.  There’s a huge cost to be able to farm this way.  So they’re making it.  These are good times for farmers, but they’re not getting wildly rich.  It’s really the people who are buying the commodities, the big grain traders, the people who are processing corn, the corporations that are feeding animals in these horrendous facilities that most of us would disagree with, the corporations that are now making ethanol, they’re making the killing.\nIt is so unfamily-farmer-friendly, it’s so healthy-food-system-unfriendly, that I think if people knew more about it, they would realize that this is really their democracy gone awry, and it’s their money.\n\nQ:  You grow what are called specialty crops, which most people have no idea means fruits and vegetables and some kinds of nuts.  Are there farmers like you in your area who are articulate or knowledgeable about Farm Bill issues?\n\nImhoff:  Oh, yes.  Yes, for sure.  In my area, there’s a lot of grape and olive and apple production.  The Farm Bill does a lot of good out there, especially when you can repair your stream bank, take care of your riparian area, put in some kind of pond to help filter the water in your winery processing unit so it doesn’t get flushed back into the system.  It can be recycled.  There’s a lot of good to be done out there, and certainly depending on your resource conservation district, that’s really your key to Farm Bill dollars, and there’s usually a lot more people who would like the conservation money than there is money to go around out there.\nYes, I think people get it.  The real question is, okay, let’s say you’re angry.  What do you do?\n\nQ:  You as a consumer or as a farmer?\n\nImhoff:  All of the above.  If you really are saying, “Look, I want this money to promote healthy food.  What do I do?”  That, I think, is the hardest part.  Then you’ve got to do the hard work of forming some kind of coalition, a coalition with enough power to make itself heard, but then have the results trickle down.  I think one thing that’s really, really lacking in the Farm Bill in the food system is that most of our regulations are one size fits all, and that size is huge and it doesn’t really apply to a lot of the growers.\n\nQ:  You mean acreage.\n\nImhoff:  Huge acres or, let’s say, huge processing facility, that it doesn’t apply to—for northern California all the way up to northern Washington, you’ve got a lot of small high-value farms that are put together by virtue of how expensive land is in that area, and also thirty years of growing consumer interest in healthy food.  They’re pretty strong markets now.\n\nQ:  Before we get to the CAFO: [The Tragedy of Industrial Animal Factories], how has the Farm Bill experience changed your life in terms of how it’s lived or how you farm or how you eat?\n\nImhoff:  Not at all.  I think it makes me read FarmPolicy.com every day—\n\nQ:  That’s big.  [laughs]\n\nImhoff:  I am really a reluctant wonk.  I’ve just become this guy that kind of popularizes and helps people make sense of some of these things, but that’s probably the biggest change, is policy is part of my thinking and researching and writing life, and I never, ever thought that that would happen.  Like, why me?\n\nQ:  Where’s the novel in the Farm Bill?  [laughs]\n\nImhoff:  Exactly.\n\nQ:  Do you have any sense of how this work has affected your family, your kids or your wife, or how you all live your life, eat, cook, whatever?\n\nImhoff:  The totality of what I’ve worked on, it definitely affects us as we try to set up the ideal home and the value systems for our kids.  Definitely my kids don’t really know—I would be shocked if they knew what the Farm Bill was if you asked them what it is, okay?\n\nQ:  That’s a relief.  [laughs]\n\nImhoff:  Yes.  However, they do know that most of our electricity is provided by solar energy and we pump our own water.\n\nQ:  You literally pump it?\n\nImhoff:  We have a well.  So we’re kind of a municipality.  We have our own septic system.  We live in the country, and you’ve got to manage all these things.  They certainly know a lot about where their food comes from.  They know what good food tastes like, and they have pretty high standards.  Our daughter is only thirteen and she’s already a really, really good cook, and she has a great palate.  We also know what a privilege it is to be able to make the kind of decisions and sometimes long-term investments, like when you buy enough solar capacity to generate 99 percent of our own electricity, you’re making a down payment, and that’s a real luxury.  We try not to take anything like that for granted. \n\nQ:  Do your kids participate in the farming at all?\n\nImhoff:  Not as much as they should, but they do.  Picking olives is really a super humbling, beautiful experience for me.  None of my family’s really gotten into it.  But it’s humbling because it takes a long time.  In eight hours you can pick about eighty pounds of olives, which is really enough for a gallon on a good day.  So I end up hiring a bunch of guys.  The beauty of it is that it’s only one or two times a year and then you’re done, and the result is, to me, it’s like the best day ever.  You pick, you start early, there’s usually some great lunch in between, you just keep picking, picking, picking, you end up with your bins full.  You take them down to the mill, and the next thing you know, the oil’s pouring out.  That’s the year’s flavors and energies just all coming together in that moment, and why would you want to miss it, right?  And I don’t.  But the rest of the family’s not quite as interested in it yet.  They certainly appreciate the oil.\n\nQ:  What kind of a press do you use?\n\nImhoff:  There are two presses in the area.  One is a stone press, really traditional, and I used to be a real “That’s the way it should be done.”  And because we might have green olives and the stone press sometimes oxidizes some of those bitter phenologic compounds, makes a smoother oil, I used to go toward that, but I’m realizing that you lose a lot of yield oftentimes on the stone press.  So the other way to do it is with a hammer mill, and the hammer mill, it’s like a whole bunch of knife blades that really just knife the olives into a pumice.  I think that it gets the temperature higher more quickly, it captures a lot of the compounds, and the yield is better.\n\nQ:  Yield in terms of size?\n\nImhoff:  The yield in terms of how many gallons of oil you’re going to get.  My buddies are often involved in the business, and I’ll ask them, “Hey, what are you doing?”  And over time I’ve found that most people in our area are going toward the hammer mill.  I don’t think the quality is that much better on the stone press.  I think that the quality’s really good both ways.  So I’m now interested in quantity.  Ten gallons of oil, that does us for the year, and I’m really of the opinion—\n\nQ:  I’m just remembering you send some out as gifts, though, too.\n\nImhoff:  Rarely.  If somebody gets a gift, then that’s a very special time, because, I mean, for me it’s gold.  I also make wine.\n\nQ:  When?  [laughs]\n\nImhoff:  Wine is very easy to make during harvest season.  We have some grapes up in Philo now, but I’ll often buy a half a ton or I’ll glean a second crop or one of my buddies  has extra grapes.  I always put up a couple of barrels of wine and have pretty good luck with making wine.  So I will give wine out as gifts, but oil is something different.\n\nQ:  Let me just go to CAFO for a little bit.  Why don’t you explain what it is and when you decided to do a book on that, and what that did to your life.\n\nImhoff:  CAFO is the evil twin of a book that came out in 2002 called Fatal Harvest: [The Tragedy of Industrial Agriculture, edited by Andrew Kimbrell], and that was a book that was published by the Foundation for Deep Ecology, so my father-in-law’s foundation.  The producers of that book, they got so far on this book on animal agriculture, industrial animal agriculture, and they couldn’t take it any farther.  The project just kind of hit a dead end.\nAfter I had finished Food Fight, my father-in-law came to me and said, “Hey, we did a good start on this book.  Why don’t you finish it.”  It was just kind of like that one job offer he gave me long ago, “Don’t worry.  Six months, we’ll be out of here.  It’s almost done.”  Right?\nWell, I looked around.  It’s a very interesting book production format in which there’s a photo version of the book, which is twelve inches by thirteen inches.  It’s a big, heavy-duty book, and so a lot of resource—\n\nQ:  With pictures of what?\n\nImhoff:  Pictures of every single aspect of animal agriculture, but this is also a family of books that the foundation has produced, and it started with clearcut forestry, then went into agriculture.  They’ve addressed arid lands ranching, mountaintop removal mining, motorized recreation in national parks.  It’s a family of books, and this was just one of many.\nSo I was working into this form where there are lots of photos and then there are also lots of essays that are written by individuals and then knitted together by the editor.  So I was the editor.  I inherited some work that had been done, and I tried to stay true to the work that was done and the effort that was put into it, but things were really changing by the time that project hit my desk.\n\nQ:  Changing in what area?\n\nImhoff:  Most of their data that they’d collected really was from before 2000.\n\nQ:  About?\n\nImhoff:  About confined animal feeding operations and this whole business of grain feeding animals in huge and huger and even huger facilities on the land in chicken houses, hog houses, cattle feedlots, dairies, broiler chicken sheds, etc.\nIn 2006, the U.N. FAO [United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization] published Livestock’s Long Shadow, and then not long after that, the Pew Commission came out with their Putting Meat on the Table, and then not long after that, the Union of Concerned Scientists came out with CAFOs Uncovered, and there were many, many other books coming out that were addressing this subject, and the whole dataset that we had, that was examining this industry, was completely updated and changed.  So I pretty much had to start from scratch, and it took a good two years to really pull the project together, instead of the six months that we thought.\n\nQ:  And presumably it’s done with a point of view.\n\nImhoff:  Absolutely, yes.\n\nQ:  Which is what?\n\nImhoff:  It’s basically that the CAFO industry is an industrial resource extraction industry that’s similar to clearcut forestry, that’s similar to mountaintop removal mining, that’s similar to these mega-scale natural resource industries that make up our daily life.  We tried to look at it from as many, many points of view as we could, from the big philosophical point of view to the animal-welfare reality point of view, to the community health impacts, to the environmental and waste impacts, and then really just open up to this discussion of is there another way, and what is that other way?\nSo, on the one hand, what are all the costs that this industry is really responsible for?  Essentially they’re telling us that they’re giving us cheap food and they’re making it really abundant.  On the one hand, they are, but on the other hand, they’re cooking the books because they’re really not accounting for all the true costs that are entailed in their production, and the only way they get away with it is to foist it on communities and on our health system and on the environment, really, and the animals are paying this tremendous price and the farmers have disappeared.\nSo then we’re juxtaposing that with there is an alternative system that most people who look at it agree that it’s healthier, it’s better, it’s slower, it might not mean that we’re going to have as many bacon triple cheeseburgers at the cost we get them now, but in the long run, there are these huge benefits that would accrue if we could go in that direction.\nPictures are worth a lot, so the CAFO book, for the first time, really tried to show people in a very graphic way what’s happening behind the scenes here, of these operations.  You might say, well, doesn’t everybody know about it?  And they don’t.  People don’t.  And there’s a reason they don’t, because the industry’s been really, really good at cloistering themselves, giving themselves legal protection.\nWhen I did this book, okay, this is my eighth or ninth book now.  I’ve never gone through a legal review like we went through on CAFO.  I mean, the first legal review was eighty pages, and the second was fifty pages.  The attorneys were questioning every single photograph, caption, statistic, claim, making sure that we were totally—\n\nQ:  For veracity?\n\nImhoff:  For veracity and because this is a very litigious industry.  So at one point for the photo selection we had 6,000 photographs.  We were narrowing down to 450.  In the end, the majority by number, the place that gave us the most images was Associated Press.  Why?  Because they have access, okay?  They have access to these places.  In three states, it’s illegal to take a photograph of a CAFO without consent of the owner.\n\nQ:  Which states?\n\nImhoff:  Kansas, North Dakota, and Montana.  And now they’re trying to make it illegal in Iowa and Florida to get a job, an undercover job and then take video and pass it on.  They’re trying to make that a felony offense in Iowa and Florida.  But the point being, look, we went to Reuters, we went to A.P., we went to many photographers that had permission to be on these facilities.  Most people that look at the book go, “Oh, my god.  This is the most horrible thing.  I’m not sure I can go any further.”  Well, guess what?  We got photos from agencies that were allowed to go in there.  Just think of how bad it would have been if you didn’t have access and they weren’t showing you the best examples of what they had?  So it was a very eye-opening experience and a tough book.\n\nQ:  Even for you, that’s amazing.\n\nImhoff:  A tough book to work on.\n\nQ:  Because of what you saw?\n\nImhoff:  Because the images just get etched into your memory, into your consciousness.\n\nQ:  The images of how the animals are treated, held?\n\nImhoff:  Oh, if it’s not that, it’s just the scale of the waste.  I was in Illinois, as I said, a couple of weeks ago, and I was with a community that they’re fighting a CAFO.  It’s a dairy.  A California dairy has come into this community in Illinois and their idea is to plunk down 5,000 cows in the middle of this farmland, and they’ve dug a series of pits in the ground.  If you put all those pits together, it would be forty acres in size and twenty feet deep, right in the middle of farm country, where you’ve got all these farmers that have been there for generations.\n\nQ:  And these pits are for the waste?\n\nImhoff:  To hold waste.  Forty acres twenty feet deep.  So you just have to ask yourself, can you imagine a worse idea?  What could be worse than living next to a pit, a lake of manure?  It’s built on a karst, very, very porous geologic formation.  How are you possibly going to keep that out of the groundwater?  There’s no way.\n\nQ:  And there’s no way they can use the waste for other farms?\n\nImhoff:  Oh, yeah, but I mean, look.  It floods in Illinois.  It rains like crazy.  It snows in the wintertime.  And the animals are—\n\nQ:  I mean, are these pits necessary, is what I mean.\n\nImhoff:  Well, when you’re talking about that many animals in one place, then, yeah, what are you going to do?  A cow, a dairy cow produces more waste than milk on a daily basis.  Right?\n\nQ:  I didn’t know about that.\n\nImhoff:  There’s no question that animals are deeply part of our food system and they have been for millennia.  However, nature didn’t intend for that many animals to be in one spot.  It’s just not sensible or sustainable, and it’s a wicked concept that’s really only about money.  In the end, what you have are states that have abdicated their responsibility to protect communities, and you have communities who have to become, in effect, citizen scientists that uphold the regulations, that then sue the corporations and sue the government to do their job, to just protect themselves from becoming an ecological sacrifice zone for milk production.  The worst thing about it is, there’s already too much milk, and the more milk you produce, the lower the prices goes, the more family farmers go out of business.  Then that’s not even counting what increasing amounts of cheese and dairy products really does to us as a society.\n\tSo I guess CAFO is the most highly charged, politicized of all the books I’ve done.  Again, it’s not a super top seller, but I have to say that that’s not why I make books.  I do it because once that book is there, it’s a reason for people to get together and talk.  This book has had really profound impacts already, and it’s already been distributed to the highest echelons of government.  It’s done its thing.  It will keep going, but it couldn’t be more pinpointed towards something that’s more important to the food system.  This is it.  Really, you talk about the Farm Bill, you talk about CAFOs, because that’s what it’s supporting.  You talk about health issues related to diet, you’ve got to talk about CAFOs, because that’s where all the saturated fats are coming from, or most of them.\nYou talk about really this connection with food that used to be deeply ingrained in our religion and our philosophy, in the biblical times, cruelty toward animals was viewed as sociopathic behavior.  Why?  Because they figured if someone was mean and abusive to animals, they might become abusive to human beings.  Well, there are no rules now that govern the production of animals while they’re alive.  We protect them while they’re being transported to the slaughterhouse and while they’re being slaughtered, but the Humane Slaughter Act doesn’t include birds, and birds are the biggest number of animals that we slaughter.\nSo we’ve completely lost this connection and this idea that how we treat animals, even if we’re going to eat them, defines us as a species.  It defines us as a society.  That used to be just standard operating procedure when there were animals everywhere.  And not only that, when you didn’t kill the goose that killed the golden egg, you only killed an animal when you needed to, and it was a respectful moment.\nSo when I think about the things I want to be remembered for as a dad, I want the kids to know that we cared about what they ate and that we took it really seriously and they had to take it seriously.  My own daughter, when we first started to raise pigs, the first time the abattoir was going to come out and do the slaughtering, about a week before, she made these posters “Save the Pigs.”  She was really worried about the pigs, and she posted it on the fridge, and wasn’t so happy, but she was the first one to eat the bacon.  Right?  So now she’s older.  She’s gone through it.  She’s seen it.  It’s deeper now, and she understands that that’s what has to happen in order to eat the way she’s going to eat.  What I’d like is for all kids to be able to understand that.\n\nQ:  If you lived here, as we’re sitting in Manhattan, what would you do?\n\nImhoff:  Gosh, I’d probably pay all my money in rent.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  I mean in terms of living—I don’t mean by your principles.  It’s not that exactly.  But where you live and with your family setup, you have a choice to be able to live by your principles.  Could you do that here?\n\nImhoff:  Probably.  What would I do?  The first thing I would do would probably be try to become a member of a community-supported ag farm so I’m somewhat connected to the producer.  Then, of course, I’d go as much as I could to the farmers’ markets.  Let’s say I had a roof.  I think I might really get into like rooftop container gardening.  Maybe I would learn to raise pigeons or something, squab or something like that.  Certainly I’d—\n\nQ:  Honey is big here.\n\nImhoff:  Okay.  So I mean, I would try.  It wouldn’t be an easy life for me because really there are few things that my days are linked around, and family’s part of it, food production’s part of it, work is part of it, and music is part of it.  So those are the four things that really are the legs of my table, right?  That’s what grounds me, and I want to continue doing them as long as I can.\nI lived in Boston.  After I finished the CAFO project, I needed to psychically purge myself from the—\n\nQ:  From the blood.  [laughs]\n\nImhoff:  Yes, from the whole issue.  I had a chance to have a sabbatical.  It had been a while.  I’d been working on this stuff.  I got into the Berklee College of Music and I spent four months there, studying.\n\nQ:  What did you say you wanted to do when you applied?\n\nImhoff:  I just said I wanted to study songwriting, and I told them that I would probably only be there for one semester, and I had a son who was just a few hours away at his school, and I wanted to visit him.  Then you go through a pretty intimidating—what do you call it?\n\nQ:  Interview?\n\nImhoff:  Not an interview, but audition.  You have to pretty much just play jazz, read music, jam with somebody.  They play something and you have to sing it back.  It’s a very humbling experience.\n\nQ:  What is your instrument?\n\nImhoff:  I’m a guitar player.  Somehow I got in.  They let me in.  So I found myself in an apartment not unlike the situation where we are here, suddenly from the country to this apartment right on Beacon Hill.  I learned to cook.\n\nQ:  Don’t tell me you were cooking all these years.\n\nImhoff:  I got into it.  I’m not a big cook.  My wife is such a fantastic cook.  I have very little—\n\nQ:  You have a lot to do.  [laughs]\n\nImhoff:  —elbow room in there.  No, no, she’s all over it and she’s great at it.\n\tSo they had a Whole Foods that wasn’t far away, there was a great little market, and cooking for one person is a whole art I’m sure that you know about, right?  So it was really different.  I certainly missed things.  It was wintertime, so I wasn’t missing that much, but it’s a lot different just being a consumer than a producer, and so it doesn’t take long to get right back into it.\n\nQ:  On the music angle, I told you there’s not much about you personally out there in cyberspace, but on Facebook you do put your musical favorites, which are, one might say, a little traditional.  [laughs]\n\nImhoff:  Yes.\n\nQ:  But what made you do that?\n\nImhoff:  Put that on Facebook?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nImhoff:  Well, there was a moment that I was at Berklee, which is just one of the coolest places I’ve ever been on the planet, 4,000 musicians, everybody’s speaking music.  They’re not really speaking English much; they’re just constantly conversing about music and even exchanging music with each other.  They had an indoctrination week for the new students, and I was essentially a freshman going to Berklee.  I got into some advanced songwriting classes, but I was also a new student and you go through all these intro weeks.\nI was at this concert the first week, and I had this feeling that I was in an AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] meeting.  After fifty years of life, I could say, “Hi, I’m Dan and I’m a musician.”  So music was something I did a lot as a kid.  I really played music quite extensively through college, and then I sort of put it away.  Then at some point around ’95 I started to play music again, and I’m right now sixteen years into again just playing lots of music, and I have a group of guys that we play around a lot.  It’s a big part of who I am.\nI think the things that are important to you when you’re young, if you’re lucky, you might have had to put them aside for a while while you’re developing your career and you’re raising kids and you’re in a new phase of your life.  I really feel like I’m going into another phase of my life where my kids are getting older and they need me less, and I have more time.  I know my time is short, and the things that are important to you as a kid, they come back.  They came back to me, anyway.\n\nQ:  Let me ask you, it’s not so much you personally, but it’s something I’m interested in with the whole food movement, if you were twenty years older, you would have—I mean, there were other things you could have been active in, that might have had a little bit more—well, whether it was civil rights.  Say it was civil rights.  Where there was a more specific goal, I guess.  What I’m interested in is whether a lot of the people in the food movement are trying to effect change in some way or other and that this is the way that’s open to us now.  But I don’t know what you think about that.\n\nImhoff:  I think that a lot of my heroes are older, are twenty years older, from Doug Tompkins, my father-in-law, who’s given me some really great opportunities, but he’s my father-in-law, my mother-in-law, they’re big foodies, really, really good friends of Alice Waters and West Coast healthy eating.  It certainly affected my family.  Then Eliot Coleman, who’s up there on the Maine coast, he’s got to be getting up towards seventy now.  And Fred Kirschenmann and Wendell Berry, Wes Jackson, a lot of these people are a lot older than me.  The question is, would I have had the luck to stumble into something?  I think so.\n\nQ:  They have also had younger outlets.\n\nImhoff:  Hopefully.  I think what is universal is if you really want to get something done, you’ve got to work your butt off.  Some people are lucky, right?  But I mean in the end, it’s really just about trying to do something that feels important and it feels right, and usually that requires a lot of sacrifice and hard work.\nWe’re lucky at a time right now we’re reaping the benefits of a lot of effort that’s gone into building a healthy food movement, and we’re still getting our brains kicked in by the big establishment.  However, they’re threatened in a huge way by this growing consciousness.  Now the real question is, how do we start to get some bigger and bigger and bigger gains?  That’s why you have to go back to things like that are the pressure points on the system, and Farm Bill is one.  The Farm Bill is something that you have to care about, even if you know you’re going to lose, because it’s so big.\nThe CAFO industry is something that is so big and so important, that you have to oppose it, because there’s fifteen good reasons to oppose it, and at some point the CAFO industry’s going to be like civil rights or slavery or women’s suffrage or something where we finally just say, “You know what?  This is not the kind of thing that we really support in our society.”  Civilized societies don’t have to be uncivilized.\nAt a certain point, hopefully we are going to say things like, “Yes, the Constitution evolves and the Founding Fathers didn’t mean that we would all be able to carry an automatic machinegun in 2000, when they wrote the Constitution,” that times change and we need to change with them.\nBut the whole food movement, I just think it makes so much sense because so many smart people have been doing the right thing and doing what it took for so long to pave the way for everybody else.  I’m just a tiny little speck on the road, you know?\n\nQ:  That’s pretty modest.  A good place to stop.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tImhoff - 1 -  PAGE 62\n\n\n\n","description":"The first decade of the 21st century has been marked by an increasing concern about flaws and dangers in the American food system, a world dominated by the rules and regulations of the United States Farm Bills.

The book demystified Indian food and in a way, was a reflection of her own introduction to Indian cooking, once she left New Delhi to pursue an acting career in England and America. Like many upper class Indian women, Jaffrey hadn't learned to cook as a child. Once she left home, she longed for the food of her childhood. Letters from her mother as well as Jaffrey's own strong sense of taste set her on her way.\r\n\r\nA well-known Indian actress, Jaffrey was at home in front of cameras and. As her food writing career developed, that experience made her a natural for television. Since that first cookbookâ€”then praised by New York Times food critic Craig Claiborne as \"perhaps the best Indian cookbook available in English\"â€”she has written 28 more, many of them in tandem with multiple television series both in the United States and the UK. She has also written countless newspaper and magazine articles, and continued a much-praised acting career.TTT\n\nInterviewee:  Madhur Jaffrey\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t        Greenwich Village, New York\n\nDate:  December 2, 2010\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is December 2, 2010, and I’m with Madhur Jaffrey in her apartment in Greenwich Village in New York.\nGood afternoon.\n\nJaffrey:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we start with your telling me where and when you were born and something about your very large family.\n\nJaffrey:  I was born in Delhi.  Our house was a big house, a joint family house with my grandfather’s children and grandchildren, most of them living together in that one big house.  It was on the Jamuna River.  We called it the Jamuna River at that time, not Yamuna, which is the Sanskritized name.\nI was born at home, because in those days women generally gave birth at home.  So know the room where I was born.  It faced the river, which I loved the idea of much later as I thought about it.  The custom then was that my grandmother would come.  As soon as the child was born, they would bring a little jar of honey and she would hold the infant and write on its tongue “Om,” which means “I am,” in honey with the little finger.  So that was certainly something that happened to me.\n\nQ:  In the lineup in the family, you were—\n\nJaffrey:  Among my father’s kids, I was the fifth child, so there was one more to come.  The fifth position in a household that had two boys and two girls was actually so wonderful, because I was left alone.  My father, all his expectations fulfilled with the first four, just, I think, decided that he could enjoy me and not have great expectations of me, which did a world of wonders, I think, for me.\n\tSo I grew up partly in Delhi, but at the age of about two, I think, my father went to Kanpur, which is in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nQ:  To manage a key factory?\n\nJaffrey:  A key factory.\n\nQ:  How did that happen?\n\nJaffrey:  There were members of the large family to which we belonged, the larger family, my grandfather’s cousins and brothers.  Amongst them, there was an uncle, [unclear], my father’s cousin, who owned a string of factories of all sorts, and one was a key factory in Kanpur.  He needed a manager, and my father was the one who was picked and went to do this.\n\tSo I was born in a Hindu family with all these Hindu customs, including the [unclear], my tongue, and all the prayers and everything else that Hindus are very much a part of.  The men participated in all that religion, but to a point.  They weren’t deeply into the religion.  They left it to the women to carry on the tradition, and they sort of stayed one foot in, one foot out of strict observances.  They were part of every ceremony, but they were asked to come in.  It isn’t that they remembered and said, “We have to do this.”  This is what I remember of my grandfather’s kids and my grandfather.  They let the women carry on the business of religion and they participated, but only to a degree.\n\tNow I’m in Kanpur and my father’s left two of his kids to study in Delhi, the boys, the older boys, and they were going to be supervised by an uncle, which was quite the normal thing to do at that time.  The schools were better in Delhi and the boys could continue their education.  They were both older.  So they stayed and they went to a school which still exists today; it’s called Modern School, still one of Delhi’s best schools.\n\tThen the girls—and I was the third and there was no other at that time—for the older two, my father was looking for a school, and eventually—I think I write about this in my book as well—eventually decided on a convent, a Catholic convent with nuns doing the education.\nSo by this time we had three major influences in my life religion-wise.  My father and mother were Hindu, so there was that very much, and my mother certainly did all the festivals and all the prayers, so we were very familiar with that aspect of our lives.  Then all the men had traditionally worked in the Mughal courts, so they were very familiar with Persian.\n\nQ:  Historically.\n\nJaffrey:  Historically.  Then Urdu, because Delhi, if you know, was a city of Hindus and Muslims.  The emperor was always a Muslim, and you worked in [unclear] Muslim languages and Muslim etiquette and Muslim way of dressing and the purdah system.  So all this was also a part of our lives.\nI remember interviewing my aunts very early on, and they said that my youngest two aunts were the first two women to go to college in the family, and they went to the same college my grandfather went and my father and uncles went and my brothers went, which is another prominent college in Delhi, called St. Stephen’s.  So these two aunts would go to college and they lived in the inner city at that time, because the family is an old family from Delhi.\n\nQ:  Inner city meaning Old Delhi?\n\nJaffrey:  Old Delhi.  So they lived in Old Delhi.  In those days, my aunts used to tell the story that they would go out of their house and there were sheets that were held up on both sides so they wouldn’t be seen.  So it was like the purdah system, which they followed because it was a Muslim society pretty much at that time.  Even though the British were there, the tradition of the purdah had carried on to a certain degree, even though my grandfather was totally against it, but it was carried on, observed in the streets.  So they would walk that way to a carriage, a phaeton, which would be waiting on a slightly bigger lane, and they would get into it.  It would have curtains.\nThen they would go to college and they were the only two girls at St. Stephen’s at that time.  So two chairs would be set up in the front near the teacher, and they would sit there and the boys would cover the rest of the classroom.  When they had to play tennis, which they both loved to do, they had to play with each other.  [laughter]\nSo that was kind of the background.  So there was that Islamic background that the men really—it wasn’t just on the surface; it went far below the surface.  They had many Muslim friends.  It was nothing.  There was no distinguishing.\n\nQ:  Tell me why your family worked for the Mughal court.  Did it have to do with their sense of being scribes?\n\nJaffrey:  I think so.\n\nQ:  Can you explain what that—\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  So I come from a community which we think was founded maybe a thousand year—around the start of the A.D.s.  Well, that’s two thousand.  Sorry.  Two thousand years ago, around then.  I don’t know how it started.  I can only imagine that they felt there were some people who wanted to read and write but not necessarily religion.  The caste system was set up that the priests were the readers and writers, and then there were warriors, and then there were the traders and businessmen, and then there were sort of lower castes and the outcasts.\nSo this was the old caste system that had been set up, and I’m sure some of my ancestors wanted to be involved with the intellectual pursuits, as it were, but not be priests necessarily.  Though some of them were of the royal classes or semi-royal classes, aristocratic classes, at any rate, they felt that they should be able to read and write everything they wanted.  So somehow the other caste grew.  That was called the caste, and these were the scribes, the caste of scribes.  This is what we belonged to, and I think it could well be that when the Mughal courts needed historians or people to keep records or do the taxes, then these people were called in because they were already fully acquainted with how to do so.\nI think also we always learned the language of the rulers.  That seems to have been the history of the family, and maybe because they needed to read and write and have a job.  So they had been in the courts and had risen to the point even of being finance ministers and high up in the Mughal court, so the running of the Mughal court, as far as reading and writing was concerned, was a lot left to [unclear], and my family was certainly very much a part of that and we were from Delhi.  So the history of the family then is really a Delhi history, very much so.\nSo now where were we?\n\nJaffrey:  So the girls were in Delhi.\n\nJaffrey:  In Delhi, and they were in Kanpur.\n\nQ:  You were in Kanpur.\n\nJaffrey:  Then my father decided to add this other element, this Christian element, to this Hindu-Muslim element, because they themselves had gone to—St. Stephen’s was set up certainly by Christians of various sorts, so their background was this, that education is best from the British.  They have a good system of education and we should avail ourselves of it, and whatever is possible, that’s what we should do.  So even though my father believed in fighting for the independence of India, and he was very much fighting for independence, but where education was concerned, he was not going to compromise, and he decided that this was the best school and it would give him educated, sophisticated young ladies as daughters, and he was attracted to it and that’s where we went.\n\tI remember going to the kindergarten in my little St. Mary’s Convent in Kanpur and not knowing a word of English.  My mother didn’t speak any English.  My father spoke English.  The men spoke English; the women didn’t speak English.  They were hardly educated.  My mother had gone up to the eighth grade, but after she died, I found all these awards that she’d got.  You know, that’s how it was at that time.\n\nQ:  So with her at home, you were speaking Hindustani?\n\nJaffrey:  Hindi and Hindustani.  We would speak in Hindustani because, as you know, both Urdu and Hindi, but when my mother read us stories in bed, which she did, she read us things like detective stories she would read, she loved them, and they were all in Hindi.  They were her Hindi books and novels that she read to us.  So really that was Hindi, that wasn’t Hindustani, but when we spoke, it was Hindustani with mixtures of Urdu and Hindi, but when she read to us, it was Hindi.\n\tSo I grew up in this kind of atmosphere in Kanpur, but also really the house was literally in a compound which had the factory, it had my father’s office, it had our house with fourteen or fifteen gardens, big gardens around it, then the house of the—was it under my father?  I can’t even remember his position, but he had his big house and his compound, and there were a lot of workers’ houses, not worker-workers, but management people, their houses also, and the factory.  The whole thing was walled in.  So we were in this walled-in world with gates.\n\nQ:  Your mother was the woman in charge at that point?\n\nJaffrey:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And she loved it because she wasn’t under the influence of her mother-in-law and my father’s sisters.  They were just on their own and it was apparently a very happy time for them.  But there would be every now and then, like we have now, we used to call them riots.  They were Hindu-Muslim conflagrations; that’s the only word.  But they were outside the walls.  We were totally protected.\n\nQ:  This was before Partition?\n\nJaffrey:  This is much before Partition.  I’m talking about the thirties now.  So we would hear this and we would be sitting behind our walls, nice and comfortable and protected from this havoc that is always taking place every now and then, would flare up, you know.\n\tThen there was the Christian side.  This was a Catholic convent, and it didn’t recognize anything but Catholics and Protestants, so we were put in the Protestant corner.  So we didn’t have to go to chapel in the morning and didn’t have catechism in the morning.  We just were called Protestants and lumped with them.  At that time I didn’t think much about it and I thought, “Fine.”  Everybody was trading pictures, holy pictures, and we were trading holy pictures of Jesus and Mary.  I liked the ones with the nice colors and they were puffed up a little bit, so they were slightly three-dimensional.\n\tThe foods that we were eating at that time in school, we had the [unclear] man that used to come with a tin and his things.  His food was so, so—all candy of various sorts, but there was like a wonderful brittle that he had which we all absolutely loved, and there was a pink and white coconut candy that he had that we absolutely loved.  So there were things that were half Indian, half British, that were vetted by the nuns.  So this Muslim guy, I remember, used to have this box like a little trunk, and he would open it up and then there was all this Bali sugar I remember.  Oh, so delicious, so delicious.  So he would have all these candies that we would buy.\n\tBut the food would come from home, because this whole Hindu idea that anybody else’s food is dirty and you can’t eat it, you have to have your own food, that followed us, you know, all the way through till the late forties, I would guess.\n\nQ:  So you brought your food?\n\nJaffrey:  We didn’t bring it.  The car would drop us, then go back, bring the bearer with the food in a different carrier, and then he would lay it out on—there were tables in the back, sort of a side veranda, and he would lay out the tablecloth and put the plates and knives and forks down and lay out all the food for us, and it was usually Indian food.  Sometimes we had cheese sandwiches or something like that.  Generally it was Indian food, kabobs and rice and things like that.  Then we would eat and he would wrap it all up and take it home.\n\tThen we would get home by about—I think school ended around three o’clock.  We would get home by three-thirty or four and be hungry again, so my mother would very often be having a nap, and she would leave food for us in an oven, and we would just go in and have bits of that.  That’s when my sister invented this thing in which they would cut off a slice of bread that was really thick at the end, and take out the inner white stuff from the bread and just leave the crust, the deep crust, and then we would take whatever my mother had left, meat or potatoes, and stuff it inside and put lots of pickle on the top.  [laughs]  And have that, and we all loved that.  Oh, there would be chapatis that were left over, and we’d roll the same stuff inside and have that.  So that would be our snack.\n\tThen dinner could be anything.  It could be Indian, it could be Western, it could be mixed.  Very often we started with a soup and then we had either Western food or Indian food, and then we always had a sort of English pudding or a tart of some sort, but made by [unclear], who made it in an Indian way.  I don’t think he’d ever been abroad.  So they had their own style of cooking, and they were called [unclear].\n\nQ:  They would cook with your mother?  Your mother would supervise?\n\nJaffrey:  No.  In the house in Kanpur, we had only a large pantry attached to the house, where you could wash up, where there was a hot oven and various storage areas, but then there was a long walkway, covered walkway, that went to the kitchen.  It seemed very long, far away, and had the walls of the compound.  And there was the real kitchen.  My mother would go there and start our dishes.  Like if there was a chicken curry, she would get all the masalas browned and the chicken browned, and then she would let them finish the cooking.  But we generally didn’t see that, because we were in the house doing our homework.  I remember occasionally seeing my mother cooking.  I have one memory of her cooking in that kitchen and making a chicken curry.  That’s why I remember it.\nBut generally speaking, the servants took care of it and she supervised it, but basically she was in the house, because when my father came home from work, he would have his tea and relax and then he would turn on the news.  We had a big Philips radio, I remember, and he would listen to the news and drink his scotch and soda, which my grandfather did, my father did, I did, and listen to the news.\nSo it became very interesting during the war, because one of my father’s cousins had married a German woman and had ended up in Germany during the war, and we found that he was broadcasting for the Nazis, so that was really sort of a shock, but my father listened to him every day and listened to whatever was coming from the other side.  So there was that and there was sort of the British side of it.  We were all getting the news, the BBC, which we heard all the time, so we were getting, in a way, more than one angle. \nAnother thing that was happening, you’d heard about the INA, the Indian National Army.  So they had joined together in Burma and were marching, I think, with the Japanese help, towards India to free India from the British.  So there were conflicting things going on in India at that particular time, where World War II was concerned.  I know we were all preparing for the worst.  My father had the windows blackened.  We had trenches dug up.  We were all ready for anyone to come and attack us, but we didn’t know who was coming.  [laughs]  Was it the Japanese who were coming to free India or what?  But that was a very interesting time.\nThere was petrol rationing, so the car was out, and my father got a horse and carriage, and we would go to school with the horse and carriage.  There was a German guy that was working with the factory, some technical aspect of the factory.  He was interred.  Is that the word, interned?  Interned.  Interred is down there.  [laughs]  Interned.  But he had a dog, German shepherd, so he didn’t know what to do with the dog, and my father offered to take the dog.  So we had our first dog.  That was our first dog.  Then we had other dogs.  Wolfie, as he was called, led us into this new world of dogs, which we knew little about.\n\nQ:  Did the rationing affect your food at all?\n\nJaffrey:  The rationing?  Yes.  Everything was rationed, including gas.  So things like grains were rationed, but we grew so much also, you see.  Our garden didn’t produce grain, but produced everything else.  We had our own cow and milk.  We had all our own vegetables.  We had onion, potatoes, garlic, all that stuff.  We didn’t have chickens; we bought meat from outside.  So grain for us was the problem.\nBut the biggest problem was petrol.  For that we had to give up the car during that period.  My father was a great—I mean, he always changed the cars and got the latest American or English car.  I remember riding in a rumble seat in the car, and he always had that.  He was a car person.\n\nQ:  He was gorgeous.  Those pictures of him are extraordinary.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, he was a good-looking man and he was a man about town a little bit.  He played bridge, he played tennis, badminton, and he smoked.  [laughs]  And drank scotch and dressed nattily.  He was a good dresser and so on.\n\tSo that life abruptly came to an end a little after the war had started.  I’m trying to think.  I was about twelve, so it must have been 1943, ’44, something like that, that my father decided to give up that job and we all went back.  My grandfather was getting ill and he wanted everyone around him.  My father was, I don’t know, very obedient and part of the joint family system where you go where your father wants you to be and not make your own decisions.  My grandfather made all decisions for my father, major decisions like what land to buy to move out.  My father made none of them, to my regret.\n\tBut anyway, so we went back to Delhi and we all hated it.  We were so used to our little quiet, wonderful, contained life.  But it turned out that Delhi was a huge cosmopolitan city and we saw then, of course, and we got closer and closer to Partition.\n\tThen I go back and I have no school to go to.  I have a find a school.  So my sisters were sent to a convent in Nanital, in the hills, so they were there in a school convent called Ramni, so it was a continuation of the same nuns, same order that was up there in Nanital.  But I was considered a little young to just be sent up there.  I had a younger sister by that time, so the two of us went back to Delhi and were put in a school called Queen Mary School, which was a missionary school, and was a missionary school for [unclear] girls, really, from the inner city.  So it had been set up that way, and anyone else could go there as well, but again, the system of education was supposedly better than—I tried a convent, and the convent had an English section and an Indian section, and I was put in the Indian section and I hated it to such a degree and I felt, “They’re stupid here.  Nobody knows anything.  The teachers know nothing.  The girls know nothing.  Only the dumb people are put here.”\n\nQ:  What language was it taught in?\n\nJaffrey:  It was taught in English, but it was dumbed down in the Indian section to such a degree that I totally rebelled.  It was like segregation, you know, really, and I could afford to rebel.  My father said, “All right.  You don’t want to stay, we take you out.”  And then I was put in this Queen Mary’s, which was the missionary school.\n\tBut the trouble was that I think I moved there when I was eleven and a half or twelve, and until thirteen everything was taught in Urdu or Hindi, and I knew neither.  I didn’t know how to write either one of them.  It was really like starting in class one.  I was so used to being the head of the class and not having to worry about not doing well, and suddenly I couldn’t read the alphabet, you know.  It was awful.\n\nQ:  This was Urdu or Hindi?\n\nJaffrey:  I had to choose.  So it was a very, very difficult decision.  My heart was in Urdu because I loved the sound of Urdu, but something very practical in me said, “Let’s do Hindi.  I should learn Hindi,” and I did Hindi.  But it was an alien—you know when you speak Hindustani, so unlike what you listen on the radio to, it’s just a totally different language, and the vocabulary I didn’t know, certainly the grammar.  I didn’t know the vocabulary and I didn’t know how to read and write.\nSo I learned.  I learned it.  It was very hard, very hard, but I did it and it was only for about a year and a half or two years, because then the whole thing changed.  In high school it all changed to English, and then it was okay.  We still had Hindi as a subject, but every other subject was in the English language, rather than having geography in Hindi and history in Hindi.  So I just had that hard struggle, but it was very good for me because I mastered Hindi and I’ll never, ever say that that was hard, because it was such a good thing.  I would never have learned it otherwise.\n\nQ:  What were the family meals like when you came back?\n\nJaffrey:  The house, which is no longer there, my grandfather’s house, there was a main house in the center.  The back was the river.  Either side were two courtyards, and beyond the courtyards was sort of brick annexes running from the river to inland.  They were high up.  The road was much further down because of flooding and things like that, so we were really off the ground quite a bit.  But one annex was where one of my uncles lived, and there were guest rooms all along, and my grandfather, he was a barrister, his office, and other guest rooms.  On the other wide, on the north side, there was the long, long, long dining room and pantries and kitchen.  So you would have to go from the main house through the courtyard, which is open, so when it was raining, you ran to the dining room.\n\tIt depended.  Every day people could have what they wanted.  It was sort of hotel-like in that sense.  If you wanted a fried egg—most people had eggs in the morning.\n\nQ:  This is breakfast.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, I’m starting at breakfast.  So any kind of egg you wanted, toast.  As children, we had milk.  We weren’t allowed tea or coffee or anything like that.  The older people had tea, but we always had glasses of milk.  So that was usually breakfast.\n\tLunch, if we were home, it probably was a weekend, that’s when we were home, and it would be usually a wonderful lunch, always some kind of meat, which was always goat, always three or four vegetables, and some kind of dal, lots of little yogurt-y things, salady-y things, pickles, which my grandmother made, all kinds of different kinds of pickles, and always, always, always fruit, winter or summer.  Dessert, there was always fruit, and if it was summer, there’d be mangos or cantaloupes, different things.  According to the season, there would just be a ton of fruit for everybody to eat.\n\nQ:  And in winter?\n\nJaffrey:  Oranges.  It was always the more Western fruit, oranges, apples, bananas.  Bananas are not Western, but things that people know over here.  I didn’t really like the winter fruit.  Guavas, that was a nice fruit that we always had in the winter, which I loved.  But it was more boring fruits.  The best fruit for me was the summer, the mangos, the lychees, the [unclear], all that.  But whatever there was, there was always a ton of fruit, great fruit of various sorts.\n\nQ:  This was laid out for you to take on a buffet?\n\nJaffrey:  Well, it depended.  The food was brought to the table, the main dishes, and it was a long table that had been extended three times by adding on other tables, because there were usually about thirty of us eating, and the kids sat at one end, the river end.  We were always on that side.  My grandfather sat facing the river, always at the head of the table on the other side.  It sort of deteriorated and became benches at the end, and at the head of the table was proper chairs.  My grandfather apparently bought a lot of the stuff at auctions, at various auctions.  He was a great man for going to auctions and buying stuff, so the furniture was basically from auction houses of various sorts.\nThe food for the main course would all be laid out, but everything would repeat itself, meat three times at least, big bowls of it, so everyone helped themselves and it was pass on.  Chapatis would come fresh again and again and again.  Everything would be replenished as it was finished.  In the winter there would be a lot of game, because the men went hunting, so there’d be deer and goose and duck and quail and partridge.\n\nQ:  Did you get up and get your food?\n\nJaffrey:  No, it was just passed along.  It was put along the table in the center of each of the three or four tables, however many there were.\n\nQ:  And even the children could take what they wanted?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, whatever they wanted.  Sometimes their mothers served them.  The mothers were allowed to do that.  They could serve their own kids if they wanted to, but I don’t remember my mother ever doing that.  We always served ourselves.  I know other mothers did, because they wanted their kids to get choice pieces of this and that, controlling it.  [laughs]\n\tThen at the end, sometimes before the ladies of the house would peel, if it was mangos, they would peel a whole ton of mangos and put them in the fridge, and then the whole thing would come out again on plates.  Or if there were fewer people, then they might peel and pass on the fruit, but somebody always did that.\n\nQ:  And your lunches at school, were they still brought to you?\n\nJaffrey:  By the time I was a teenager, we took our lunches in little tiffin carriers.  I used to bicycle to school, and I would have my tiffin carrier hanging from my bike and I would take it.  We would sit with all our friends and eat together.  Everyone would bring their tiffin carriers and we would share, Hindus, Muslims, no problem at that time, till just before ’47.\nThen it became a major problem and a fearful problem, because suddenly nobody was getting along.  It can happen.  I think Partition is the worst thing that can happen to a nation, the worst.  It brings out the worst in people and it just leaves nobody happy, I think. \n\nQ:  At school you had Muslims?\n\nJaffrey:  Half the class was Muslim, at least, and suddenly from being very good friends with everybody, we were not.  Nobody wanted to talk to the other side.  And I remember such a feeling of aloneness, feeling that, “I’m in the middle.  I think like nobody thinks.  I’m not on this side, I’m not on that side.  What side am I on?  Who am I?”  I was twelve, thirteen, so it was a bad time anyway, and then to have this inflicted on one made it even harder, because you felt really, “Where do I belong?”  I wasn’t a Muslim and I didn’t agree with the Hindus either.  So that was how that was.\n\nQ:  Then during the fighting, did you continue to go to school?\n\nJaffrey:  We continued to go to school except on certain days when there was too much violence and everyone stayed home.  Nobody went anywhere.  I remember my father and uncles, all the men taking guns and their hunting rifles—it’s all they had—and parading the whole area that all our houses were in.  We were in what used to be an orchard once, and it was all family houses.\nThis parading and at one time somebody came and said, “The gangs are coming from the other side,” and we could hear them.  Everybody moved like a mob, you know.  Terrible fear, what would happen to the men.  But it passed.  It passed.  Then at one point there was another mob somewhere else, and my uncle said, “I have to go.”\nWe said, “Don’t go.  Please don’t go.  You’ll be killed.”\nHe said, “No, my friend is trapped there.”  He had a friend who was a doctor, and the doctor was trapped and the mob was coming.  He somehow got through, but his friend was shot dead.  I mean, that happened everywhere.  It happened everywhere, people killing people just because they were of another religion, you know.\n\nQ:  And the food supplies were interfered with?\n\nJaffrey:  You couldn’t go out and shop, so people had what they had and made do, made do.  Usually in our kind of house, so much is put away.  There’s a ton of grain, a lot of vegetables are grown, and even if you don’t have fresh vegetables, you have onions, garlic, ginger, pickles, you know, dals.  You can always eat.  I never felt a shortage during that period.\n\nQ:  During and after Partition, then what happened in terms of how your life was constructed?\n\nJaffrey:  Well, it didn’t just end like that, because then followed that million people being killed, with Hindus going towards India, Muslims going towards Pakistan, and all those killings on the trains.  Trains would arrive with dead people, you know, horrible things like that on both sides.  Both sides did incomprehensible things to each other.\n\tThen half the girls were gone in my class, just gone.  Some may have been killed, some went away.  I never saw any, not one of them again.  My father’s friends, some of them stayed, some of them left.  My brother’s friends mostly left.  I actually talked to one the last time I was in Pakistan.  I actually managed to call one of my brother’s friends.  I found him and he was dying of cancer, but I managed to speak to him.\nBut my father’s friends, it was so interesting, there was one house on what was then called Barakhamba Road.  I don’t know what that road is called now.  It has some other name.  Anyway, it was one of the main roads in New Delhi.  He was a very wealthy man, had a big house there, and they all left.  The house was empty and bare for a long, long time, but there were servants’ quarters at the back, which were taken over by a family of refugees, and they also were a wealthy family in the Punjab, and they came and took over.  There were five girls, and my sister became very friendly with one of the girls, of one of the five girls, so it was kind of ironic that a lot of men left this family, then another family came in the servants’ quarters and one became my sister’s best friend.  Actually, one worked as Mrs. Gandhi’s secretary, was with her till the end when she died.\nSo people were replaced by other people, and refugees poured into Delhi, poured into Delhi, changing Delhi.  What year did you come?\n\nQ:  It was right after the Bangladesh war, so it was in ’73, I think.\n\nJaffrey:  By the fifties, Delhi was like a refugee town.  There were refugees everywhere.  Any open area had become an encampment of refugees.  There were new markets.  Delhi was growing by leaps and bounds, new extensions here, there, but all suddenly, and everybody spoke with a different accent.  There was the Punjabi accent that people in Delhi weren’t used to.  The whole spirit of Delhi was very elitist, I suppose, at least the people we knew, of a Hindu-Muslim kind of background, and that all changed.  It became a different city with much more energy.  The Punjabis brought lots of fresh energy and enterprise into the system.\n\nQ:  I found that they also brought tandoori.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.\n\nQ:  If you could talk about that and how the food changed in that respect.\n\nJaffrey:  What happened was that we didn’t really go out to eat, because, again, this whole idea of food being pure and clean and all that, except my father broke the rule all the time for certain Muslim dishes which could be had only behind the Red Fort, you know.\n\nQ:  In a stall or something.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  Behind the [unclear] there were all these Muslim lovely stalls with certain kinds of breads which he loved and certain kinds of kabobs which he had grown up with in the inner city.  He’d grown up with all these things.  All this thing about dirty food, this, that, and the other, he broke the rule himself all the time because the driver would go out with our utensils, our napkins, and they would come back looking like they were made in the cleanest kitchen, with fresh white napkins on top, and then he thought everything was fine.\n\tBut the food changed because the Punjabis have a much more enterprising spirit than we did in Delhi.  We were rather effete.  They opened restaurants.\n\nQ:  That was unusual?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  Restaurants that we would go to, upper-crust restaurants, in Connaught Place there were restaurants, expensive restaurants that you could go and have Russian food.  [laughs]  Things like that.  And good Indian food, but Punjabi food.  Then Moti Mahal was a very humble restaurant in [unclear], which sort of connects Old Delhi in a way to New Delhi, but it’s in Old Delhi, and it wasn’t an upper-crust restaurant at all, but we all discovered it because it had the great tandoori chicken, and we’d never seen a tandoori in our lives.  It was, to us, new, nouvelle cuisine of a certain sort.  And we hadn’t had meat that was like rare.  We hadn’t had chickens that were this juicy.  We’d never had anything like that.  The naan was something we did not know at all in North India, and we did not know the khalida, the way it was cooked in the oven over twenty-four hours.  So all this was very new and very exciting.\n\nQ:  And all these were at Moti Mahal?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  Moti Mahal started it, and of course today nobody can think of Indian food without tandoori chicken, but it was really one restaurant that started it for all of us.\n\nQ:  Were you allowed to go?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, we were allowed to go.\n\nQ:  Did you ever bring it back home?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, we did.  We brought it back home, we took it on picnics.  It was all considered okay.  It was hot food, so it was considered pretty much okay.  Don’t ask me why.\n\nQ:  Safe.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, safe.\n\nQ:  But it didn’t change the way you in your homes would have cooked?\n\nJaffrey:  No, no, no.  You’d go back and it was all the same.  Nothing changed at home.  Absolutely the same dishes, and we wanted them.  We wanted them the same way, because we loved them.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we go back to your schooling and how that continued.\n\nJaffrey:  Well, I think what had happened in Kanpur was I had already worked out what I was good at and what I wasn’t good at.  I certainly was not good at math.  I was great at needlework and I was great at anything to do with English, English literature.  I was great at history.  I was very good at geography.  I couldn’t sing.  I knew that early.  My sisters could.  I couldn’t.  But I certainly could write and I was a good student.  Math I always managed to do, managed to learn enough to ace it, but never liked it, never liked what it made me do and made me think, and I didn’t want to think that way.\n\tSo when I came to Delhi, I continued that.  I was again very good at history, geography, English.  Again, I struggled with math.  And then discovered in high school that you could have a choice.  You could do either higher math, which was algebra, geometry, mathematics, or lower math, which was arithmetic and what they called domestic science.  [laughs]  We had a teacher from—I don’t know, she seemed to be from England in the 1930s, who would teach us, for example, how to wash clothes. \n\nQ:  Oh, it was domestic science.  [laughs]\n\nJaffrey:  So you take a scrub board and you go like this on the scrub board.  I said, “Okay.”  And then cooking, and the cooking was British invalid cookery.\n\nQ:  Ai-yi-yi.\n\nJaffrey:  It was really, really awful, but I said, “Okay, I can learn this.  I can learn the corn flour pudding recipe,” and whatever there was.  “I can do this.”  But very strangely enough, when it came to the high school exam, we were independent by then, and some bright-eyed inspector must have said, “Why are we making these girls make this blancmange and this awful soup and stuff?  Why don’t we just give them some Indian spices and say, ‘Cook’?”  Well, I wasn’t ready for that, so I couldn’t make any [unclear] mashed potatoes.  They gave us onion, garlic, ginger, tomatoes, spices, and light a fire.  They gave us wooden matches.  I didn’t get too far with that, and I probably failed that, but won out on the arithmetic and needlework, which I was very good at, which was also part of this whole domestic science-mathematics package.  So I did all right in school.\n\nQ:  When did the acting come in?\n\nJaffrey:  Well, I was acting since the convent days.  I couldn’t sing, so I couldn’t get the big parts like my sisters, but I hopped around as a brown mouse and did other things.  [laughs]  Then the minute I came to Delhi, it became more serious, because they were doing Shakespeare in school.  I remember playing Robin Hood.  It was an all-girls’ school, so I got to play Hamlet, I got to play wonderful parts, all the parts that you wanted to play.  I played Titania in Midsummer Night’s Dream in school.  This is all school.  So I was acting all the time in school and acting in college, from the beginning.\n\nQ:  You knew you were good at it or you enjoyed it?\n\nJaffrey:  I just enjoyed it at that time.  I had no sense of it as a serious vocation.  I just enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nQ:  And that was okay with your parents?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, because I was in school and there was no question of doing it any other way in school.\n\nQ:  How did you get then to the scholarship that took you to RADA [Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]?\n\nJaffrey:  So then I was in college, Miranda House in Delhi, and then I did my B.A. in English and acted throughout school, and joined an amateur theatrical company called—you must have known them.  You must have known them.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  This is a continuation of my interview with Madhur Jaffrey.\n\nJaffrey:  So when I was a kid, we used to go to see Shakespeare down by St. Stephen’s College.  They always did an annual Shakespeare play, as a kid, I remember even at the age of three or four.  So Shakespeare was very much—we all knew Shakespeare.  We recited Shakespeare, just grew up with Shakespeare.  Indian kids, at least when I was growing up, we all grew up with Shakespeare.\n\tI remember when Dame Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, came to India and they were performing at St. Stephens College, here were all these kids mouthing the words because we knew everything.  They said, “We’ve never seen anybody react this way to Shakespeare.  We have not seen it in all our travels.”  Because we were the perfect colony that way, you know.  We loved Shakespeare.\n\nQ:  Did they have a sort of traveling troupe?\n\nJaffrey:  The two of them were going around together doing Shakespeare.  But here was an audience that really was waiting for them.\nThen remember Felicity Kendal and that group?  They had their company that went around doing Shakespeare.  And everybody lapped all this up because we considered Shakespeare ours.\nI remember my daughters were at school, Nightingale-Bamford, a school in New York, and I was complaining that they knew so little of Shakespeare, and how can you go through school and not know Shakespeare, and somebody said, “Why don’t you come and teach.”  So I did, very briefly, and nobody was familiar with Shakespeare, nobody.  How can that happen?\n\nQ:  Again, to get you to the scholarship stage—\n\nJaffrey:  So here I am, joined the Unity Theatre.\n\nQ:  This is as well as school?\n\nJaffrey:  Doing college and joined the Unity Theatre and doing all kinds of plays like Christopher—\n\nQ:  Marlowe?\n\nJaffrey:  Not Marlowe.  Much later, twentieth century.  Christopher—anyway, the name will come to me.  Sorry about that.\n\tAnyway, doing modern plays, doing Shaw, doing Sartre, The Eagle has Two Heads, all kinds of plays, but in the English language.  Unity Theatre did everything at that time in the English language.  So, various people had come to see me who worked at the British Council through the years.\n\tThen suddenly I found myself—there was an award that the English government was giving to Indian artists in different cultural fields.  So you could apply as a painter, you could apply as a sculptor, anything, any of the cultural areas, arts, any of the arts.  So I applied as an actress and I got that award, which is a small amount of money, but I asked if—in those days you couldn’t take foreign currency.  There was no foreign currency allowed.  You couldn’t take it out.  So I applied to use it in England, because at that time there was no drama school in Indian, none.  So I asked if I could use it in England and they said yes.  But it wasn’t going to be enough money.\n\tSo then I was doing a play, Tennessee Williams’ short one-act, called Auto-da-Fé, and the head of the British Council came to see me and thought I was good enough to warrant one of their scholarships.  So I had an Indian scholarship, I had that scholarship, and then I couldn’t get a scholarship until I auditioned, which meant going to RADA to audition, and I auditioned there and I got another scholarship.  So then I was all right.  I had three of these not huge scholarships, but three scholarships, enough to get me going.\n\nQ:  You thought of this as a professional—\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, I was now thinking that this is what I wanted to do in life, was act.\n\nQ:  Just out of curiosity, what were your brothers and sisters doing?\n\nJaffrey:  My father was in business, so my brothers were in business.  My eldest sister had gone to England and she became a schoolteacher in England and stayed, and eventually rose to the head of the English department in the English school system.  So she was there.  My next sister got married and never worked, and my younger sister joined Swissair and worked at Swissair.\n\nQ:  So there was no resistance to having the children—\n\nJaffrey:  No, not for working.  My father just felt that I should be in the Foreign Service.  He said, “You should sit for the Foreign Service exam.”  He felt I could do it, and he just saw me was an ambassador to some place, I think, and I did not see myself that way, and I said I didn’t want to.\n\nQ:  But that’s very forward-thinking.\n\nJaffrey:  Of my father, yes.  He was.  He was really forward-thinking and wanted the best for his children.  He somehow had great hopes for me in areas that I had no interest in.\n\nQ:  So you got on a plane?  How did you do this?\n\nS:  Then I had this scholarship and I was—I don’t know, I must have been twenty-something, very early twenties, and I was ready to go.  I totally knew that this part of my life was not the fulfilled part of my life, that something else was waiting that would be the life.  I just knew it.\nSo my father took me to Bombay and I remember we spent a night at the Taj Hotel, which we’d done many times, so my history with the Taj goes back since I was twelve years old.  Then the next day, he put me on a boat.  It was one of the P&O liners.\n\nQ:  That’s a long ride.\n\nJaffrey:  Twenty-one days at that time, and it went through the Suez Canal, which either had blown up already, the whole thing with the war.  The Suez War of ’57 had either happened already and was sort of getting sorted out, but we went through the Suez Canal and I saw Aden for the first time, went through the Red Sea, through the Mediterranean.  It was quite exciting.  And then to Southampton and then to London.  And I loved it.\n\nQ:  Where did you live?\n\nJaffrey:  Eventually I lived in several places and moved because I didn’t like the landladies.  One used to read my letters, and there was another one who did something else awful.  I ended up with a very young couple.  They were a Jewish couple in a very Jewish neighborhood, a young Mr. and Mrs. Gold.  They were probably my age or maybe two years older or something like that, and they had one little baby when I was there, and while I was there they had another little baby, and I used to babysit for them.  That’s where I made my first Indian food.  They included me in everything, and every evening at ten o’clock they would have tea and I would sit and have tea and biscuits with them.\nIt was in their living room that I first saw that wonderful April Fool’s Day thing with the spaghetti growing on the tree.  Have you seen that one ever?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nJaffrey:  You haven’t seen that?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nJaffrey:  So the news was on, and we used to listen to the ten o’clock news or whatever it was every night with our tea and our biscuits that they had, and, “This thing that we have just discovered, that the way to grow the best spaghetti is—,” and then the camera rolls, and there they are on these trees with the spaghetti hanging, and they said, “To get it to the same height so it fits into the box, we want each of them to be of the same length so then they can be packaged more easily.”  It was a gorgeous little documentary, and everybody’s saying, “What?  What?”  And the next day, of course, they said April Fool’s Day.  But that was the first day they showed it, and they’ve shown it again since.  It’s just such a wonderful little snippet of fun.\n\tSo anyway, I was staying with this really, really lovely couple.  The husband died when he was forty.  I remember I was doing Medea at the Lyric Theatre in London, and the wife came to see me and we sort of caught up, Mrs. Gold, Blanche Gold, came to see me and we talked again.\nSo I started cooking.  The first dish I made was a potato dish in their kitchen.\n\nQ:  Let’s talk about that.  What got you to writing to your mother for help?  You were eating British food, presumably.\n\nJaffrey:  Terrible British food, which was really—lunch was [unclear] and in the canteen, and it was horrible.  It was this gray roast beef sliced thin, with cabbage, watery cabbage and watery potatoes, and I would just go crazy.  I said, “There must be something better than this.”  Any Indian restaurant that I tried was awful.  [unclear] had a restaurant.  I think there were very few.  I went to the one on Regent Street, whatever its name is.  It’ll come back to me.  It was awful, and that had been there since 1926.  Veeraswamy.  So I thought, this is nothing like Indian food.\n\tSo then I wrote to my mother and I said, “Please help me how to cook.  I don’t know anything.  I can’t make tea.  I can’t make rice.”  So she started sending me letters.\n\nQ:  What did you start out with?\n\nJaffrey:  With what I asked for.  I asked for a potato dish, I asked for a cauliflower dish, and I asked for one goat, lamb dish which is made with whole spices, and I knew it was simple to make, which I loved when I was in India.\n\nQ:  How did you know it was simple?\n\nJaffrey:  You know, this is the thing.  This is what I have realized in retrospect, that obviously I had a very good palette since birth, and obviously I was recording what I was eating and had a great sense of how it was made, even though I never watched it being made, but I could taste.  If you eat one thing, cumin, ten times in ten different ways, you know how it’s been used.  You just sense.\n\nQ:  Actually, that’s amazing, to take an example like a spice.  I think you would know how it was being used, but many people wouldn’t have the taste memory.\n\nJaffrey:  That’s it.  If you have a palette, you’re recording.  And if you’re recording, you have a taste memory.  This is a thing that you find out later.  There has to be a taste memory or you wouldn’t be able to bring it back.  And my mother’s recipes, which were like a little bit of this, a little bit of that, I was able to adjust it because I already had a sense of, “Oh, I think I put too much,” of this or that.\n\nQ:  You would try to make it [unclear].\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, and it was easy to adjust and it was easy to remember the taste exactly.  And that’s why I knew it was simple, because the meat hadn’t been browned, this, that, and the other, and there were just two or three things in it, and it was just so delicious.  So I thought, “I think I should be able to do that.”  And I probably heard somebody say it’s a very easy thing.  I don’t know.  But that somehow was in the back of my head always, so I was able, with those rather simple recipes, to make a whole lot of things.\n\nQ:  Where could you get spices?\n\nJaffrey:  Very close to RADA.  There was a place called the Bombay Emporium just off Euston Street, and I could just go after class and pick up whatever I needed.\n\nQ:  And you had enough money to do that?\n\nJaffrey:  Oh, yes.  My father couldn’t send me too much money, but whenever he could, he did, and then I had my scholarships.  I was fine.  I always live within my means, and I managed.  I even went on holidays to Europe.\n\nQ:  What did you do about the cooking equipment?\n\nJaffrey:  Whatever the Golds had, they used.  I was living with them and they said, “Use anything you want,” and I did.  They were very sweet about it.  Then, you see, I was making this potato dish, but I couldn’t make any Indian breads.  This was, as I said, a Jewish neighborhood, and they had a great baker.  I would go to the bakery and get pumpernickel bread, which I had never seen before in my life, and I would eat my pumpernickel bread with the Indian food, and I thought it was delicious.  It was delicious.\n\nQ:  And now you live in the home of pumpernickel [unclear].  [laughter]\n\tDid you continue to stay with the Golds long?\n\nJaffrey:  I stayed with them until I left, till I left RADA.  I finished RADA.\n\nQ:  So that was two years?\n\nJaffrey:  Two years.  And then I came to America, and I stayed with them till I left.\nI have the same pencil and the same pen as you.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  So what made you go to America?\n\nJaffrey:  Well, at that time I was involved with Saeed [Jaffrey], and he also tried to get a scholarship like I had, but he got one to America and it was at Catholic University.  He ended up there with a drama scholarship.\n\nQ:  You knew him in India?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, we worked at the Unity Theatre.  I met him at the Unity Theatre.  Then he was in radio and I worked in radio too.  You know, radio was another part of my life, because as kids, we lived near a radio station, and every time they needed kids, our family—they had very good expression, those kids from that household, so we were called.  We did radio plays and whatever was needed as kids.  Then when Doordarshan, this big radio station, opened up in New Delhi, we were called there, so all through school I was doing plays when kids were needed.\n\nQ:  On India radio?\n\nJaffrey:  On India radio.  Then in college, I was working as a disc jockey, you know, reading—\n\nQ:  How did you do that?\n\nJaffrey:  It was just a job and I did it at night.  I did the night part of it.\n\nQ:  No kidding.\n\nJaffrey:  A bus would come.  Not a bus, a car.  The radio station would send a car, pick you up and take you back at night.\n\nQ:  Your parents were really amazing.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, they had no problem because they thought I was safe.\n\nQ:  This was a time when you met Ruth Jhabvala?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  So one of my earliest plays, I think it must have been college, I don’t think it was high school, could have been high school, either high school or early college, so I’d been doing radio stuff forever.  She was casting.  I went there on a casting call for this [unclear], and that’s how I actually talked to Ruth for the first time.  I think I may have seen or met her at the Regal Theatre, which is where I have this memory of a ballet performance or something like that, and we were all there.  I think I saw her and Jhab at that time.\n\nQ:  So there was this tiny Polish-British woman.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, married to a very funny guy.\n\nQ:  A wonderful guy.\n\nJaffrey:  We got to know each other immediately and saw each other.  I don’t know why we started.  I think Saeed also.  And, actually, Ruth won’t admit it, but her first novel, her very first novel is about Saeed and me, so you have to read it.  It changed its name.  Amrita: Or to Whom She Will.  I think that was the original name.  It’s really about two people in a radio station who fall in love, and the girl is from my neighborhood.  So you know where she’s got the idea.  She said, “No, no, no, no, no.”  So that’s her first novel.  So obviously I knew her before that, before she wrote that.\n\nQ:  Did you stay in touch at all while you were in England or after you got to America?\n\nJaffrey:  Not really.  We didn’t stay actively in touch, but then after Jim [Ivory] met her, when he came to do The Householder, I knew Jim and Ismail [Merchant] before.  I knew her.  I knew them.  Then they were going to do their first film in India, which was The Householder.\n\nQ:  Let’s first get you from the U.S. back.  Let’s do New York first.\n\nJaffrey:  Okay.  So now where are we?\n\nQ:  You and Saeed were in New York?\n\nJaffrey:  No, we were in Washington [D.C.].  He was at Catholic University and I joined him there and we got married and we came to New York.  We lived on 26th Street.  I was just there and I was looking at the house.  It’s was called O’Henry’s House on 26th Street, between Sixth and Broadway.  We had three kids very quickly, sort of in a row.\n\nQ:  Just to interject a little bit, you say it as though it was perfectly normal for you to marry a Muslim.\n\nJaffrey:  My father, actually, I asked him before we left, that this was what I was—so I had Saeed come over and my father looked at him, and afterwards he said—and he used to chew thirty-two times or almost that much, and you’d ask him a question and he’d answer and then he would chew and then he’d wait for the next part to come.  So anyway, he ended up by saying, “I don’t mind him being an actor, but he looks very pale.  I think he’s not well.”  [laughter]  So that’s how we left it.  So anyway, I think they knew we were going to get married, and we did.\n\nQ:  And the religious problem was not—\n\nJaffrey:  Not with my family, because my father always felt that he was very liberal and behaved like a very liberal man.  I think his objection was that he had no profession that had steady money.  My sister also married a Muslim, but she married a doctor, so that was okay for my father.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  I can see that.\n\nJaffrey:  That he was fine with, but me, he said, “She’s a crazy girl and she’s going to do what she’s going to do.”  I think he had no great expectations of me other than he saw great potential in me, and I think he enjoyed my company because I was such a—\n\nQ:  Live wire.\n\nJaffrey:  Live wire, yes.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  So where and when did you get married?\n\nJaffrey:  We got married in 1958, in Washington.\n\nQ:  You presumably were comfortable in the kitchen at that point.\n\nJaffrey:  I wasn’t cooking at that time.  I started cooking when I came to New York.  We came to New York then.\n\nQ:  When was that?\n\nJaffrey:  1958 we came to New York.  We had no money, so I started working as a guide at the U.N., because I could get a visa for the U.N. and work as a guide, and Saeed was working with the Indian government, doing public relations with the Indian Tourist Office.  So that’s how we were sustaining ourselves, and then we were taking on off-Broadway plays of all kinds.  Saeed was in a play by Lorca.  I think it was Blood Wedding at the Actors’ Playhouse.  I have a picture of me standing in front of the Actors’ Playhouse, very pregnant with my eldest daughter, but it’s only from here.  So I think Jim went to see that play and he had done his first or second little documentary.\n\nQ:  But you didn’t know him?\n\nJaffrey:  No, we did not.  It was The Sword and the Flute, and it was about a miniature painting which he was very interested in.  He was a collector.  He wanted somebody to narrate it, and he thought Saeed would be the perfect person.  So that’s how Jim came into our lives.  Ismail was looking for a way to get going.  He was terribly ambitious.\n\nQ:  He was in Bombay?\n\nJaffrey:  He was in Bombay and he had come as a student to NYU [New York University], a business student.\n\nQ:  I didn’t know that.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  He was still in school, and dreams were big.  He had heard of Saeed, because we were quite well known in Indian, were known in the sense of amateur theater, people knew who we were and we had done a lot of stuff together in India, and he wanted to do something with us.  It was as if he was looking to move up the ladder.  He said, “We’ll do a play together.”  I remember him on one side, Saeed on the other side, arguing.  I had given birth to my first daughter.  They were arguing what they should do and what they couldn’t do, and Saeed was feeling taken advantage of.  Anyway, there was this big battle going on on either side of me.  They were thinking of doing a Sanskrit play together, then Saeed was dreaming about bringing Sitara Devi to dance in Radio City Music Hall, you know.  I was trying to tell him, “I don’t think this is going to happen, Ismail.”  But nothing stopped him.  That was the great thing about Ismail.\n\tSo we would invite Ismail.  I would cook.  Meera was a very little girl at that time, and I would cook and we would all talk about our plans.  Then Jim joined this group as well, because we knew one and we knew the other in different ways.  I can’t remember exactly how it happened, but sometime we said, “You must meet Jim.”  We were talking about doing a film together.\n\nQ:  You and Jim?  Or you and Saeed and Jim?\n\nJaffrey:  Saeed and me and Jim.  The whole idea, Jim had an apartment on East 64th Street, it was a brownstone.  It was an apartment, a brownstone.  We’d sit on the floor—there wasn’t much furniture—and write out the script, because at that time Saeed and I planned to go back to India, start a traveling company and tour with it.  We started writing this script down.  Then when Jim went to do The Householder, which he then somehow—I can’t remember the sequence.  Let me just say it this way.  He went to do The Householder and met the Kendals, because Shashi [Kapoor] was the star in it.  Then he decided the Shakespeare Wallah story came into it.\nMeanwhile, Saeed and I had divorced and Jim was mad at Saeed and didn’t want him in any way in any part of this.\n\nQ:  Because of the divorce?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, the way he’d behaved, etc., etc.  So he was going to cut him out of it, this whole thing, anyway.  So the idea of Shakespeare Wallah then began to mature, but he wanted a role for me.  Where was I going to come in with this new story?  So then Ruth was prevailed upon to write this movie star role for me.\n\nQ:  Who asked Ruth?\n\nJaffrey:  Jim had already gone.  You see, The Householder happened before.  All this was going on, but somehow The Householder happened before.  He met Ruth, who did the screenplay for it, and they met the Kendals and they met Shashi and Jennifer.  So now they knew this group and had a diary, so they decided they would use part of that diary and make another film, because they really were cutting out also Saeed and using these people that they’d met, whom they liked a lot, and who had a story already written, sort of.\nBut how would I get into it?  So they persuaded Ruth, and Ruth would not budge.  She said, “No, she can’t play a movie star.”  When she knew me, I was very—I still am—I was thin, wore glasses, and in her mind—\n\nQ:  You weren’t blonde.  [laughs]\n\nJaffrey:  Not at all a buxom movie star.  So Ruth kept saying, “No way.  No way.  She’s not.  Jim, you don’t understand.”\nAnd Jim kept saying, “You don’t know what she looks like now.  Just see her.”\nSo anyway, with great reluctance, Ruth wrote—you have to ask her about this—this role for me, and I have to say that she was fine when we met.\n\nQ:  This was in what country?\n\nJaffrey:  In Delhi, when I went to Delhi for the shooting.  She was fine, but when I drove up to Kasauli, my first shots were in Kasauli, and I was driving up, throwing up along the way, and arrived.  All the crew looked at me and said, “She is going to play a movie star?”  [laughter]  I said, “Oh, god, again.”\n\nQ:  You were pregnant?\n\nJaffrey:  No, I wasn’t pregnant.\n\nQ:  Just throwing up.\n\nJaffrey:  I was just throwing up because of the curves of the road.  I always throw up when I go to hill station.  I have done that since I was a kid.  But it all worked out.\n\nQ:  Then where were you living?\n\nJaffrey:  When?  When we were shooting?  Then Saeed and I were divorced, and the kids, I think, were with my parents and my sister in India.  I was trying to get a divorce, which I went to Mexico for, and then I came back.  Then we went to do Shakespeare Wallah after I’d got my divorce.\nThen I was in India with my kids, after Shakespeare Wallah, and Jim and Ismail said, “We are taking the film to the Berlin Film Festival, so you must all come.”  And, you know, Ismail always had this big thing, “Come on!  We’re going to a festival!”  So there we were in Berlin, at the Berlin Film Festival for this film.\nWhy was I telling you this?\n\nQ:  Just following where you lived.\n\nJaffrey:  Oh yes.  So at that time my parents had rented a place for me just next to my sister—it was actually attached—in Defense Colony, so I was living with them there at that time.  Then I left and went to the film festival in Berlin, where, of course, things went very well.\nThen they said, “We’re now going to go to the New York Film Festival, Lincoln Center Film Festival.”  So then I came here.  I’d already met Sanford [Allen] before, but nothing major had happened between us, but then we met up again and we decided we wanted to get married.  So then I sent for the kids and they came back.  Then we moved in here in ’67 and we’ve been here since.\n\nQ:  During this time that you were making Shakespeare Wallah and afterward, was anybody cooking?  Was Ismail cooking?  Were you cooking?\n\nJaffrey:  Ismail was cooking too, but whenever they came to my house, I cooked a semi-elaborate Indian meal.  I was cooking.  I was really cooking through that marriage.  I was cooking, learning new things, learning biryanis and pulaos.  I was determined to master everything.\n\nQ:  How did you learn them?\n\nJaffrey:  Getting recipes from my family, mostly, learned that way.  I bought one cookbook, Mrs. Balbir Singh’s cookbook, which was the only one, and it was very complicated, but it was helpful.  It was very helpful to me.  But most of the recipes were coming from home.  I certainly was cooking, and Ismail, always from the earliest days, he cooked something.  He always made a dal, he made a rice, and we got that every time, actually, dal and rice and then shrimp.  He used to make a shrimp with cherry tomatoes.  Then sometimes the dal had slices of lemon in it.  It was always tasty.  It always tasted good.\nVery often you’d go up there and there’d be nothing and he hadn’t shopped.  “Ismail, are you going to cook?”\nHe said, “Wait, wait, wait.  You sit down.”  And then he’d give you a job.  “Can you collate these papers?” or something.  “I’ll be just back.”  And he would start his shopping then and come back very quickly, put everything on, and by the time you finished collating his work or whatever he wanted you to do, there’d be dinner.\n\nQ:  And that was New York.\n\nJaffrey:  That was New York.\n\nQ:  Wow.  That’s really amazing.  At what point did you think you had collected enough recipes that you wanted to put together your own?\n\nJaffrey:  I never felt that way.  That was much later.  Even though we were already 1967, that didn’t happen till ’69.\n\nQ:  And that happened because Judith Jones found you?\n\nJaffrey:  No, no, no.  Judith was much later.  Several things happened.  Ismail, who, as I keep saying, he can sell his little finger if he wanted to, could sell his grandmother if he wanted to, decided he needed publicity for Shakespeare Wallah, and he did everything.  Most human beings don’t do that with his kind of budget.  So he persuaded Craig Claiborne to do a big piece on me as an actress who likes to cook.\n\nQ:  He knew Craig Claiborne?\n\nJaffrey:  He didn’t know anybody.  He just found a way to meet him, which was utterly charming, and found a way to get to meet him.\n\nQ:  What was his goal in terms of doing a piece on you?\n\nJaffrey:  All Ismail wanted was publicity.  That’s all he wanted.  [laughs]  So in many ways Ismail is responsible for starting me off in certain directions.  This was another one, the Craig Claiborne connection.  Craig Claiborne had probably not written anything on Indian food before.\nIt’s a really funny story and I don’t tell it because it’s an awkward story.  Craig Claiborne was going to do this piece.  I was living with Sanford in a one-room apartment on Eleventh Street, and I said, “I can’t have Craig Claiborne come here.”  So a friend of ours across the road had a nicer apartment, so I said to William, “Can I borrow your apartment?  He’s just coming to interview me.”\n\tHe said, “Fine, fine.  Just use the apartment.  Here are the keys.”\n\tSo he and his wife gave me the keys, and Craig Claiborne walks up and he comes in and he’s looking at the kitchen and the bookshelves, seeing the cookbooks on the shelves, and said, “Oh, these are the books you’re interested in.”  Not me.\n\tSo then he talked to me, he interviewed me, and I said, “What can I cook for you?  Shall I make this and that?”\n\tHe said, “Yes, you can make this, but not today.  I’ll come back in a week.”  [laughter]\n\tI said, “Oh, my god.”\n\tSo next week I had to ask them again for their house and again go through the charade.  So he took pictures and he did that particular article.\n\nQ:  What did you make?\n\nJaffrey:  I made stuffed peppers, stuffed with potatoes, which is one of my mother’s really wonderful dishes.  So I made that, and the article came out as a result of that and one other thing.\nSo now I had these three kids and I feel they are my responsibility.  I have to earn enough money to send them to school, and being brought up the way I was, they had to be not just any school, they had to be the best schools.  And how was I going to do this?  So we had put them in the local school here, but I was very unhappy with the local school, so I started writing.  I was writing for the Smithsonian, any paper that wanted—I wrote for The New York Times, I wrote for—gosh, any—\n\nQ:  These were articles on Indian food or what?\n\nJaffrey:  No, they were articles on music, on dance, on drama, sculpture, and buildings.\n\nQ:  Anything you could—\n\nJaffrey:  Anything that I could get.  I was looking up the other day, going through some of them, and I have an article on the method of preserving paintings, the art of preservation of paintings.  Anything, but it was in the world of the arts.\n\tThen there was a magazine called Holiday magazine.  It’s not there anymore.  Pamela Fiori was the secretary.  She’s now the editor of Town & Country.  My editor was Patricia Bosworth.  So my editor then was Patricia Bosworth, and Pamela Fiori was her assistant.  Pamela went on to be the editor of Food & Wine and now is with Town & Country.  Anyway, so she was just a secretary.  I wrote my first piece.  They said, “Do something about India and growing up in India and what food was like.”  So that was my first piece on Indian food.\n\nQ:  For Town & Country?\n\nJaffrey:  No, no, no.  For Holiday magazine.  I did that piece, and I used that in the introduction to my first cookbook, bits of that, and sent it in.  Based on that and that first thing that Craig Claiborne did, I was approached by a freelance editor who said, “Would you be interested?  Nobody’s done an Indian cookbook.  Would you be interested?”  So I started putting, vaguely, recipes together.  But he soon disappeared.\n\nQ:  The idea didn’t scare you?\n\nJaffrey:  No.  In fact, I’ll tell you the story.  So then it didn’t go anywhere, but somebody suggested that they had a friend who worked at another publishing house with a P.  I can’t remember the name.  It’s all escaping me.  Anyway, a big publisher, one of the big ones.  So they took my book and they said, “Send the recipes.”  I was sending them recipes.  They were putting it together.  Then half they sold and somebody else came in and it became another company.  My editor was fired.  I ended up with another editor, Virginia Kelly, I remember, and she was very excited about the book, but then the whole company disbanded, and that publication house went dead.\n\tSo now I have this book which is almost finished.  It is finished, and nowhere to take it.  So I went to my friend Ved Mehta, and Ved said that he knew André Schiffrin, and that I should talk to André Schiffrin.  So I spoke to him, and André said, “Judith Jones in the best person.  Why don’t you send it to her.  So I will speak to her.”\n\tSo I sent it to Knopf, and Judith took one look at it and bought it.  It was very, very quick. \n\nQ:  This was An Invitation to Indian Cooking.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tJaffrey - 1 -  PAGE 53\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Madhur Jaffrey\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #2\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t         Greenwich Village, NY\n\nDate:  December 16, 2010\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is December 16, and I’m with Madhur Jaffrey at her apartment in Greenwich Village for our second interview.\nGood afternoon.\n\nQ:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  Since we’re down here in the Village and I know you knew James Beard, why don’t you tell me about how you met him and what happened after that.\n\nJaffrey:  Well, what happened was that I had written—let me actually start not with James Beard, but with my first book.\n\nQ:  Okay.\n\nJaffrey:  Because in a way, you were asking me about it and it’s all one continuous story.\n\nQ:  That’s good, actually.  We’re back to An invitation to Indian Cooking.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.\n\nQ:  And working with Judith Jones.\n\nJaffrey:  I don’t know if I went into it before.  The way the introduction came about was that I had written an article for The New York Times.  I hadn’t written it.  Sorry.  Craig Claiborne did an article on me.\n\nQ:  Yes, we did talk about that.\n\nJaffrey:  We talked about that.  So as a result of this—I think we talked about it—I was approached by an independent editor.  That came to naught, but then the book went to Harcourt Brace and, at that time, Jovanovich.  It was coming along.  It had been there for a couple of years, and a wonderful young editor there, and then they went through this thing where every half the people or third of the people were fired.  It was one of those times for the publishing industry.\n\nQ:  Just like now.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, yes.  So amongst the people fired was my editor, my young editor.  She handed it over to somebody, but it was not a very good relationship.  Nothing was moving because they were in a very precarious position.  So I decided to take the book away.  I had a friend, Ved Mehta, whom you know, who knew André Schiffrin.  This is the actual story.  I’ve never mentioned these names before when I tell the story, because most people don’t know who they are at all.  I didn’t think it mattered.\n\nQ:  I’m glad to have them, yes.\n\nJaffrey:  So André said, “Let me look at the book.  Send it to me.  I will look at it.  Or better still, I will give it to Judith Jones to look at, at Knopf.”\n\tSo almost overnight, that book, which is now a completed book, you see, because I’d been working on it for so long, went to Judith, and she bought it overnight.\n\nQ:  She must have been very thrilled to have a completed book.\n\nJaffrey:  It was a completed book, and I had written it pretty much the way it appears.  What Judith was very good at was saying things like, “You need more of this.  You need to say what to serve with what.  You need to have menus at the end of the book, because people are not familiar with Indian food.  They don’t know how to serve it.”  So all that came from her, but basically what I sent her was a completed book.\n\tIt’s funny, I was being interviewed by The Hindu the other day, and they said, “How has your style changed from that time to this time?”  And when I look at that book, I could have written it today.  It hasn’t changed, actually, all that much.  I think I understood the logic of recipe-writing instinctively and didn’t need to be taught how to write a recipe, and I always wrote recipes with a certain amount of detail, because I felt it would have helped me had my mother sent me more detailed recipes, and for people cooking for the first time, it’s absolutely essential.\nSo my style of writing cookery books had pretty much evolved, and Judith certainly was most helpful in looking at it from the outsider’s point of view and say, “I would want to know this.  I would want to know that.”\n\nQ:  Things you would need for the American market.\n\nJaffrey:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And those included things like what would you serve with it and all that.  I was already inclined to write stories in there, but she encouraged me to write more personal stories so that each recipe had some connection to human beings rather than just be a pure recipe.\n\tSo now here I am, I’ve got a very tiny advance for this book and it’s ready, and Craig Claiborne has already given it a wonderful review, because he had sort of found me, in a way.\n\nQ:  How did he find you?\n\nJaffrey:  Through Ismail.  You see, Ismail, whom I keep saying could sell anything he wanted, had, needless to say, found Craig Claiborne, and he always knows who the players are and he gets in touch with them and keeps up with him.  That’s his genius, was his genius.  So he knew, “Okay, Craig Claiborne has to be cultivated,” and made friends with him, told him that he must do an article, the way he talked, “You must do an article on Madhur!  She’s a great actress and she loves to cook!”  So he did this article.  I told you the story about the article.\n\nQ:  You told me about Craig Claiborne, yes.  Not James Beard, but Craig Claiborne.\n\nJaffrey:  I had told you the story about that.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJaffrey:  Okay.  So he does this piece.  The book is selling a little bit here, a little bit there.  There are young students at Harvard [University] buying it.  But there’s no great demand for it.  Judith said, “One of the ways we build demand,” she’s very good with all these other aspects of it, “is you should teach.  People should know of you as a teacher.  You should pass on this curiosity, the interest in this new food.”\nSo I said, “All right.”\nShe knew James Beard, so she approached him and said, “Where could she teach?”\nSo Jim, very open, said, “Here in my house.  She can teach in my house.”  He lived on Tenth Street.\nSo I was going to teach there, but we tried advertising in a meager way, but nobody signed up.  I said to Judith, “What are we going to do?”\nShe said, “Don’t worry.  We will get a few people from Knopf, maybe a few people from Gourmet, secretaries, assistants.”\nThen Jim said, “I will be in every class,” and he was.  He was sitting there in every class.  So that’s how I started teaching and got to know James Beard.\nThen he moved to Twelfth Street.  Of course, it was right in my block.  So as he was getting older, he would ask me to come and help.  What he was teaching in those days was basic courses in making pancakes, in making sauces, Hollandaise sauce.  What did I know?  But I had Julia Child.  I had already, without knowing who she was, before she did any television program, had already bought her book, and it was my great introduction to good French cooking.  So I would have to teach classes the next day, and then the night before, I would sit with my Julia Child, and she had great things, like, “If it goes wrong, this is what you do.  If this goes wrong, this is what you do.”  I had really understood all that.  Then I would go teach, and it didn’t seem all that difficult.  So, crepes, pancakes was one course, sauces was another course, and I was teaching all these for Jim.\n\nQ:  As opposed to Indian cooking.\n\nJaffrey:  I was also teaching Indian cooking, but he would ask me to come and help out on these other courses and other things that he was teaching.  If he was ill one day, then I would teach the course.  So it was a wonderful relationship.  He would come to our home for lunch and we would sit and talk or we would go over to his house and often Marion Cunningham was around.  I had never had polenta before, and she made a polenta with tomato sauce that I thought was the best thing in the world I’d ever had.  [laughs]  So the four of us, Sanford and I and Marion and Jim, would sit and have a meal together, whoever was in town.  So we became great friends.  The fact that I was an actress intrigued him because he was a singer.\n\nQ:  Of course.  He had wanted to perform, yes.\n\nJaffrey:  He said, “You know, we are very similar.  We are hucksters.”  [laughs]  That’s what he used to say to me.  I thought, “Hmm, maybe I am.”  But he saw a common kind of spirit in me, so that’s how I got to know him.  Of course, over the years we got to know each other better and better.\n\nQ:  Did you stay in touch with him after you stopped teaching there?\n\nJaffrey:  Oh, absolutely.  I was living here, but he was around the corner, and you couldn’t pass his house, his manservant, Clay [Triplette], would be looking out of the window.  He’d say, “Hi!  Come on in.”\n\tThen when Jim got ill, we did go to see him when he was ill.  I think this was like a week before he died.  We were going to see him, and I called him up.  I said everybody must be bringing him things, so I should call him and ask him what he’d like.  And I called him up.  We were in the taxi and I jumped out and I called him from a pay phone, and I said, “What can we bring you?”\nAnd he said, “Some strawberries would be nice.”\nSo we looked for some strawberries.  We took that to his room.  There people were almost having a party there.  And he said, “Open that drawer.”  Opened that drawer.  Nuts.  Opened the next drawer, wine bottles, you know, in the hospital.  So we stayed with him for like an hour, and everybody had a drink and ate something.  Then somebody else must have called, because I heard him say, “Some asparagus would be nice.”  [laughter]  So he loved his food till the end, and we stayed good friends all the time.\n\nQ:  Those are nice memories.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, very nice memories.\n\nQ:  Let’s go back to An Invitation to Indian Cooking and the reception of it when it finally was out.\n\nJaffrey:  The marvelous thing for me and, in retrospect, even more marvelous is that young people in colleges began to buy this book, and it was a word-of-mouth thing.  I have had kids—I mean kids, people in their forties—come up to me and say that they were raised by parents who cooked Indian food from my book, and that they were now cooking it for their kids.  So that has been a great source of comfort, and the fact that that book is still in print.\n\nQ:  It’s a wonderful book.\n\nJaffrey:  It warms the cockles of my heart [to have the book still in print].\n\nQ:  You mentioned the other day that your mother sent you some early recipes, and one she sent you—\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  What I was asking you about was, you mentioned that one of the recipes involved whole spices, and so you thought that was easier.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  It’s also because I liked it very much.\n\nQ:  Is that in the book?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, it is.\n\nQ:  Which one is that?\n\nJaffrey:  I’ll have to get it.\n\nQ:  Okay.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  Judith was always present at every photography session.  I remember this cover being done, and Judith was there.  She was there when the photography was being done for my last book.  She’s very present in—\n\nQ:  How many of your books has she edited?\n\nJaffrey:  Now four, the first two and the last two.\nThese are my mother’s letters, which were—\n\nQ:  I’ve always wondered what they were.  I see.\n\nJaffrey:  They’re in Hindi, and there [are] recipes in there.  I was living in London, and obviously it was the time of that war where Israel was involved, England was involved.  It was the Suez Canal.  I remember, because I wanted to write and tell them the British reaction, so I scribbled “Suez” over here, “single room.”  Obviously when I wrote home, I was going to tell them about living in a single room and about the Suez, the reactions to the Suez war in England.  So it gives the time of these letters.\n\tSo the recipe was—this is falling apart.  Lamb with whole spices—here.  [Jaffrey is looking at a copy of the book]. This is it.  It’s the first recipe in the “meats” chapter, this one.\n\nQ:  Are any of the other recipes that she sent you in the beginning in the book?\n\nJaffrey:  They’re all there.\n\nQ:  They’re all in the book.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So there was a potato one.\n\nJaffrey:  One was [potatoes with asafetida and cumin], yes, which must be in the book, because I started cooking with that one.  See, even here I’ve done all my vegetables alphabetically, always organized in my mind so people should be able to find things in a cookbook.  This was one of the early ones, stuffed whole pea pods with cumin, because I love those.  Potatoes with asafetida and cumin, this one is the first one I ever cooked, and this is what I ate with the pumpernickel bread.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, the girls were how old at that point?\n\nJaffrey:  This is 1973, so the girls were ’59, ’60, ’62, so they were like eleven, twelve, thirteen or less.  Sorry.  Eleven, twelve, and down, going down to nine. \n\nQ:  The reason I ask was I see that you did Autobiography of a Princess in 1974.\n\nJaffrey:  Right.\n\nQ:  But I didn’t find a book between ’73 and ’81 with The World of Eastern Vegetarian, so basically I wondered were you very tied up either with the kids or with articles.\n\nJaffrey:  With the kids and I was doing articles and I was touring.  You have that [printout] thing?  I was touring with a touring company, doing like pretty much what I’m doing now, which is talks, lectures.  I was doing a lecture on tea.  I was doing a lecture, readings of poetry from India, from ancient and modern India, but I had worked it out as a sort of seven stages in a woman’s life, pretty much that way, but using poetry from Asia, from all over Asia to do that.  So I was doing that.\n\nQ:  Where was that?\n\nJaffrey:  Everywhere.  I was getting very good fees.  It was an agency that called me up.  They must have heard me on the radio.  They said, “Would you like to speak, go on a speaking tour?”\n\tI said, “Speak about what?”\n\tAnd they said, “Anything you want.  Obviously you can talk.”  So, based on that, they sent me around.  They called it A Thousand and One Nights, you know, what else, and I probably have a brochure of that somewhere if you want to see it.  I went around on tour and I earned my money through writing articles and doing the speaking tour.\n\nQ:  Let’s talk about Autobiography of a Princess.\n\nJaffrey:  It took me five years to write the vegetarian book, so it took a while.\n\nQ:  How would you like to do this?  Would you like to stay chronologically or talk about your performing work in one chunk and the food work in one chunk?\n\nJaffrey:  I think so, because I don’t have the chronology straight in my head.\n\nQ:  Tell me about Autobiography of a Princess.\n\nJaffrey:  That came about, Jim and Ruth and Ismail were working on it over a long period, because every year they would say, “Oh, we’re going to do it, and we’ve signed Laurence Olivier.”\n\tAnd I said, “Oooh, great, great, great!”\n\tAnd, “Oh, we’re going to do it this year and we’ve signed Gielgud.”  And it wouldn’t happen.\n\tSo the script had been written much before.  Ruth had written it, and they’d given it to me, but I wouldn’t learn it because I thought, “It’s not going to happen.”  Then when they said it’s James Mason, first of all, I hate to tell you this, but I was disappointed.  I thought, after Olivier and Gielgud, James Mason?  Okay.  They said, “We’re going tomorrow,” and I hadn’t learned the lines.  It was just awful, because it just happened like that.\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, where were they?  You were here.\n\nJaffrey:  We were all here, but going traveling to different places to do different things.  All of us were traveling around, but basically Ismail was here, Jim was here, and we were all here.  They had gone to India and they’d gotten the footage from the maharajahs, and that’s what started it, from the palaces.  They found these little bits of footage, real documentary footage.\n\nQ:  That’s what inspired—\n\nJaffrey:  That’s what inspired Ruth to write what she did, and it was based on the footage, really.\n\nQ:  How did they find the footage?\n\nJaffrey:  They just went around.  Jim, as you know, was very interested in art, major paintings, things like that.  So he loved to travel through India, looking at palaces, and this is what they discovered as part of their interest as well, to see what was available, and there were all these bits of film.\n\nQ:  They were film.  I see.  So that’s what made them think, “We can go farther with this”?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, get it all together, old footage of old films that maharajahs had taken.\n\nQ:  So when Ismail said, “We’re going tomorrow,” where did he mean?\n\nJaffrey:  London.  The screenplay was set in London, so it was to be shot in London.  Suddenly we were there, and I remember the first day of shooting.  I was still struggling because I’d been in a plane, learning, learning, learning my lines, and James Mason came in and he knew his lines.  I’d checked up on him with people who’d worked with him or thought they knew him a little bit, and he seemed to be a monster, an egotistical monster in Hollywood, and yet he was absolutely wonderful with me, absolutely wonderful.  I mean, he would sit—you know when you do your close-up, the other actors usually vanish, but he fed me my lines, he sat on a low stool and fed me my lines.  I would see him walking around the set, saying his lines.  If he had to take off a hat and put it somewhere, take off his scarf and put it somewhere, and he would be practicing like I would, and I thought that was interesting to see.  He was doing this kind of miming with the props, as any actor would, to work out how you would do it.  So it was very interesting shooting with him, and very, very wonderful shooting with him.\n\tThe other interesting thing about Autobiography was that Ismail, in his usual way, had gone up to Garrard’s of London, the big jewelry shop, and said, “We’re shooting this film and we need the best jewels for this princess.”  So he had maneuvered it in some way so I had this necklace, the most expensive diamonds and emeralds, necklace, earrings, bracelet, and every day the equivalent of their Brink’s truck would come with everything, taking a different route every day, and then they would put it on me and tape it to my neck.  One man would follow me to the bathroom, to the this, to the that.  I couldn’t go anywhere.  At the end of the day, they would pull the Scotch tape off and all my little hair would sort of come off with it.\n\tOne day while we were shooting, there was a blackout.  Maybe they plugged in too many things.  I don’t know what happened.  And everybody was on me, protecting the jewels.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  I see.  Not you.\n\nJaffrey:  Not me.  They didn’t give two hoots about me.  They were protecting the jewelry.  So that’s a typical Ismail thing, you know.  It happens with every film, especially if you’re playing royalty, and I’ve done quite a bit of that for him, like Begum in Heat and Dust.  Again, he managed to lull the people their fears of never letting out their jewelry and collecting it and bringing it.  Ismail had that way.  He did that in Cotton Mary.  He got all the furniture from various people who never gave out their furniture.  He managed to get it from them.\n\nQ:  He was very charming.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, yes.\n\nQ:  How long did it take?\n\nJaffrey:  Actual shooting, four days.\n\nQ:  So you were away from home for how long?\n\nJaffrey:  Not more than ten days.  But it was shot in sequence.  Because it’s a one-hour film, it was shot in sequence and we did the actual shooting in sequence, but we had rehearsals and meetings and things like that on days before.  But the actual shooting was just four days.\n\nQ:  You were thinking of yourself as an actress primarily at that point?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, of course.  Of course.  And the time line, you see, I don’t even have any memory of any food in that time line, though there probably was, because I’m sure the vegetarian cookbook—no, this one had just come out.  Then it came out in England the next year, and then I was working on my vegetarian one and writing all those hundreds of articles that I wrote.\n\nQ:  That were prior to or part of the Eastern Vegetarian book?\n\nJaffrey:  No, no.  They were completely separate.\n\nQ:  Just making money.\n\nJaffrey:  Just making money.\n\nQ:  Speaking of making money, the Merchant Ivory company, one thing it’s not known for is making money.  [laughs]\n\nJaffrey:  I have never made any money on their films.\n\nQ:  So this film was professional and a labor of love.\n\nJaffrey:  All of them, till the bitter end, until Cotton Mary.  I never made any money on any film, and the only film I made money on was Cotton Mary.\n\nQ:  And why was that?\n\nJaffrey:  Only because Ismail was horribly, horribly guilty, because I had brought the script to him and I had wanted to direct it, and there was a—well, we won’t go into that one.  But I didn’t, in the end, and I think he just felt very bad about it.\n\nQ:  So you came back here to New York, and did you try to get other acting work or were you primarily—\n\nJaffrey:  Always, always.  If you look at my acting bio, it might tell you what I was doing in those years.  I can’t remember, actually.\n\nQ:  But that was your primary identification?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, to myself, certainly.  Is there anything in that period?\n\nQ:  I’m sure there is.  Let’s see.  The Guru was before that.\n\nJaffrey:  That was ’67, yes.\n\nQ:  The Guide, Conduct Unbecoming.\n\nJaffrey:  Those were on Broadway, both of them.\n\nQ:  They were in the late sixties, early seventies?\n\nJaffrey:  Is there no date there?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nJaffrey:  I don’t even remember.  I think this was around—yes.\n\nQ:  It says before Autobiography of a Princess and then it skips to Heat and Dust, but you must have done things between ’74 and ’82.\n\nJaffrey:  Must have, but can’t remember them.\n\nQ:  Nevertheless, your primary identification was—\n\nJaffrey:  For me, it was as a working actress, but England was the big deal, you see.  England changed that.\n\nQ:  Tell me about that.\n\nJaffrey:  Because that’s ’82, so I don’t know if we’re jumping ahead or not.\n\nQ:  That’s all right.\n\nJaffrey:  What happened in ’82 was that I was teaching at home, in my little kitchen, four people at a time, and the BBC was looking to do an educational—so we’re talking maybe 1980, 1979, something like that.  They were looking to do an educational program on Indian cooking, hoping, I think, to present the culture of the community, people would [learn] more about [the South Asian] community.\n\nQ:  Yes, this describes it as an eight-part Indian cooking—maybe it’s a different thing—series plus a cookbook to go with it.\n\nJaffrey:  Right.  That’s it.  But we started working on it, obviously, even though ’82 may be the date it was shown, it took a good year or more, two years, to put it all together.  So I must have started working on it ’80, probably, ’79, ’80.\n\nQ:  If your daughters were asked what their parents did, how did they describe what you do?  Do you have any idea?\n\nJaffrey:  I have no idea.  [laughs]  Probably that I’m an actress.\n\nQ:  Sanford’s easy.  [laughs]\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  I’m sure they said, “She’s an actress,” because this was all rather vague and undefinable, I think.\n\nQ:  Do you have any sense of when you began to think that this cooking thing could be—\n\nJaffrey:  After.  After the BBC, because it was a huge hit.\n\nQ:  Yes, it says it was repeated at least five times.\n\nJaffrey:  The numbers of books I sold and the money I made, you know, because television books sell.  If you have a show on television, you sell books.  This is the unfortunate irony of book sales.  So it was sudden.  I mean, that book has sold over a million copies.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nJaffrey:  So it just sold and sold and sold, and is still selling, that book, the first one.  All of them, I mean, they all did well, but this one is still in print.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  So we’ll go back to Judith and how she reacted to the idea of your doing a—\n\nJaffrey:  Judith didn’t want me to do a vegetarian cookbook then because she already had an author.  What was her name?  Can’t remember.  She had done two books, first one had been very successful and she had done another, and I thought I was the rightful person who should be doing it because I knew Eastern food and Western food, and I would be the ideal person to do it, but because it had already been done, and successfully done, Judith did not want me to do it, and that upset me.  That really upset me, because I thought I was a great candidate to do this book.  And I did eventually do it, not with Judith.\n\nQ:  Did you have a contract for the Eastern Vegetarian?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  I got more money than I did for this book, Invitation, but really nothing.  This was really minimum payments in terms of royalties.  But that book, too, is still in print, the Asian Vegetarian.\n\nQ:  And you had to travel a great deal for those recipes?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, yes, but I enjoyed that.  That’s the part of it I really enjoyed, looking for the recipes, looking for the culture of the areas, seeing what recipes develop in one area and how they differ from another area, and what are the slight differences and why they are there.\n\nQ:  Where did you go besides South India?\n\nJaffrey:  I was writing articles for Gourmet and traveling for them, and I was picking where I wanted to go.  I would ask them, “Do you want an article on Thailand?  Do you want an article on the Philippines?  Do you want one on Japan or Hong Kong?”  And I was doing all these articles, but it was also for myself, really.  I wanted to see these places.  I wanted to understand their food.  Indonesia was another one.  Goa in India, just different parts of India, different parts of the Far East, and even I did another one—I think it was for Gourmet—on the history of Delhi food, because, again, it gave me an excuse to study what had happened with the food, at least from the Muslim period, starting tenth century at least from there onwards.\n\nQ:  Did you take your girls with you when you would go back and do these things?\n\nJaffrey:  Sometimes, yes, but I’ve never taken anybody with me on long trips.  I usually go alone to most places, because I work with such concentration.  I’ve kept every notebook.  So what I do is I travel with a little notebook in my bag and I write in pencil, or it could be a pen, in the little notebook.  Then I come back to the hotel or wherever I am staying.  And because I scribble in the car and I can’t read it half the time, so if you don’t fair it out, as it were, that night, as you probably know, it’s gibberish three days from then.  So I used to fair out and fill in the thoughts.  So I have these two books from every place I’ve been, a rough one and a fair one, and I’ve got them.  I just never throw anything away, so the books are there.\n\tThen I would write recipes in detail.  Like if somebody’s cooking—and I always wanted to see them cook.  I didn’t want them to hand me a recipe, because nobody knows really how to write proper recipes.  They leave things out, and you can’t tell if the heat is high or low, or what kind of pot it is, what is the ideal pot.  So I like to watch them and write all these details down.  They would just do this with salt, you know, just put it in their hand and throw it in.  But eventually I began to have an idea of how much that was, you know, it’s like roughly a tablespoon, roughly a teaspoon.  I would write that “rough teaspoon,” rough this.\n\tThen I would come home, back to America.  I have never had help.  I did it all myself.  So I would do the shopping, I would do the cooking, the writing down in pencil in the kitchen.  Then I would take it to my computer and write out the recipe in the computer, clean it up, write a headnote of some sort to the recipe.  So it was a lot of work for one person, but I never delegated.  I couldn’t trust somebody to do it as well as I could, because I thought they’re bound to leave something out, they’re not going to be as comprehensive as I am.  Every cookbook has errors of various sorts.  It’s like mistype “teaspoon” for “tablespoon,” that happens, or you leave an ingredient out.  But basically, the cookbooks are as good as my writing can be and as complete as I can make them.  It’s really all my doing.  So if it’s flawed, it’s my flaw, pretty much.\n\nQ:  So in that process, your sense of yourself as a culinary writer must have changed, developed?\n\nJaffrey:  Not really.  I mean, I think I was doing that from the beginning.  I was just being ultra, ultra careful.\n\nQ:  But what I mean is in terms of this as a professional activity.\n\nJaffrey:  I never looked at it as such, but in retrospect, I think I became surer, but not necessarily better.  I think I’m just as good in the last book as I am in the first book, so I don’t think I improved markedly, but I have become surer.  That’s all I can really say.\n\nQ:  I was really more asking about your sense of self.\n\nJaffrey:  More confident.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, probably.\n\nQ:  But you were still acting when you could?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, I would drop everything.  The only time I couldn’t—and it was a big, big, I think, career changer for me—there was a film called Lean on Me with Morgan Freeman that I was asked to be in.  It was a small part and they said, “We’ll make it a big part if you come and do it, and it will be a month of shooting.”  It was the same time that I had agreed to do the first BBC program, so then it was a dreadful, dreadful choice to do a BBC series in which I was knowingly going to make so much money, and the film, where it seemed I’d done something.  But here was a book, and I knew how well I did in books.  So in the end, I had to turn it down, and my career could have taken a different turn had I done it, because that was one of the first films for Morgan Freeman.  It didn’t happen, though.\n\nQ:  You mean a more American turn?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, yes, yes.\n\nQ:  How did Heat and Dust come about?\n\nJaffrey:  Again, it’s Jim and Ismail.  I think they were ready to give somebody else the part, and I said, no, I wanted it.  Jim said—I remember his words very well—“How can I ask you to play Shashi’s mother when you played his mistress?  It would be very ungallant of me,” Jim said.\n\tI said, “I don’t care.  I want to do it.”  It was a small part, but I just wanted to do it.  It just seemed like such an interesting film.\n\nQ:  Where was it filmed?\n\nJaffrey:  In Hyderabad, so it was great.  So then I was exploring the foods of Hyderabad, so terrific.\n\nQ:  What I have is in the next couple of years you started exploring children’s books as well.\n\nJaffrey:  Right.  I have a need to do something, and empty spaces make me feel I’m useless, so I always fill them up with something.  My husband always says, “You take on too much,” and it’s true, but if I don’t, I’m sitting there, even if there’s nothing to do for two days, I say there’s nothing, I have no work, a desperate feeling.\n\tSo what were you asking me about, actually?\n\nQ:  How the children’s books—\n\nJaffrey:  So then I had this idea that I never sat down and told my children stories.  I would read them from Indian history, you know, tales of Akbar and Shah Jahan and how they tossed people off the ramparts, you know, and stories like that, more than children’s stories.  I said there’s so many tales that I grew up with, that my aunts and my cousins and older cousins and my grandmother and all told us, and somebody should write them down, because my aunts were all getting older.  There was such a wonderful style of storytelling in the family.  So I started taping my old eighty-year-old aunts and taking their stories down.  I didn’t know when they’d die off, and they did very soon afterwards, but I did tape them all.\nI had these stories now, in Hindi, of course, so I rewrote them for American kids, and that’s how the first book started.  Then there was another one of stories that my father used to tell us, so that became the second one.  Then the third one was somebody approached me and said, “Would you do a book about markets around the world with little simple recipes for children?”  Markets around the world and simple recipes.  So that was the third one.\n\nQ:  So these were different publishers.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, different publishers.  I tried selling the idea for the children’s book, the first one, Seasons of Splendour: [Tales, Myths, and Legends of India], much earlier, but it was sent around and everybody turned it down, everybody in this country.\nSo now that I was very successful in England, so a publisher asked me, “We would love you to do children’s books for Pavilion.”\n\tI said, “I just happen to have something.  I have to find it.  I wrote it a while ago.”  And they bought it immediately.\n\nQ:  It seems like around the same time, what I have written down here is the Assam Garden film.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, that was an English one.\n\nQ:  And then doing Medea in London.\n\nJaffrey:  Same director, yes.\n\nQ:  At BBC.  So it looks like in 1986-87 you were very busy performing.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Was that all in London?  How did these come about?\n\nJaffrey:  Assam Garden was a very interesting story.  There was apparently a very little piece in one of the English papers about a garden that had been discovered in Devonshire, I think.  An English Surgeon General posted in India had come back from India with a lot of plants and he had set up this garden in the nineteenth century.  The garden was now still there.  He’s gone, but the garden was still there, was overgrown, etc., etc.  So the idea, the germ of the story came from that, and the writer wrote a story based on this little germ of an idea.\nThen they were looking for a place to film it.  As happens, you send out these people who scout—location hunting based on the script.  So the film-makers were taken to all kinds of locations, and by complete chance, they were taken to this place, the actual place where it had happened.  I think it was on the river.  It may have been in Wales technically or not, I can’t remember, but it was sort of north of Bristol somewhere.  So we shot there.  We shot in that area, near the Severn River.  It was near the Severn River.  It was a beautiful.  The garden had to be cleaned up.  It was vastly overgrown.  We shot in that garden.\n\nQ:  These conversations, when you were having them with these people, you were here, is that right, in New York, and then would return to England?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  I lived here.  Every time I had to get a visa, had to get a labor permit, etc., etc., to work in England.\n\nQ:  Was that complicated?\n\nJaffrey:  It was complicated, very complicated, but they did it for me every time.  They helped me get it, whatever was needed.\n\nQ:  Is that like the Actors Equity rule here?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  You have to get permission to work there.\n\nQ:  What about Medea?\n\nJaffrey:  The director of Assam Garden, we got very friendly and began talking, and she said, “What would you like to do?”\n\tI said, “Well, a classical play, maybe Medea or something.”\n\tShe said, “Let’s do it.”  So she got the ball going and she directed it, so that’s how that happened.\n\nQ:  This says Love Match on the BBC.\n\nJaffrey:  A television film.\n\nQ:  And Perfect Murder.\n\nJaffrey:  A film.\n\nQ:  In Britain?\n\nJaffrey:  No, Perfect Murder was not.  Perfect Murder was sort of an Merchant Ivory film, but not really, because I think Ismail—no, Ismail didn’t direct, but they gave it to Zafar Hai, director.  So they gave the script to him and he directed it, but it was a Merchant Ivory production.  They were in charge.  So that’s how I was in it and so was my daughter.\n\nQ:  Did you feel a continuing part of the Merchant Ivory—\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you talk about that.\n\nJaffrey:  Merchant Ivory became like a family.  Whenever they had a party, they would collect all the people that had worked with them, so we all got to know each other, you know.  We would see each other at these gatherings, Merchant Ivory gatherings, so if you were Christopher Reeve or you were Emma Thompson or Helen Bonham Carter, we all met all the time, so we feel as if we know each other, but we don’t know each other that well.  Some of us do, but not all of us.  But we did know each other as being part of this family, this Merchant Ivory constellation or whatever it is, and we kept meeting at all kinds of functions.\nOf course, a lot of us were there when Ismail died, too.  So we were together in England whenever there was a party in England, all the English side of us would be there, and if there was a party here, there would be some of the English side and some of the Indian side and some from the American side.  The opening, everybody would go everywhere to these things.  So it remained and then actively used again and again, so we would see each other very often at work as well.\n\nQ:  This says that Madhur Jaffrey’s Cookbook was 1988, so at some point you started working on that, and then it says “a three-year project for the BBC, Madhur Jaffrey’s Far Eastern Cookery.”\n\nJaffrey:  That was a huge project.\n\nQ:  So you were balancing a lot.\n\nJaffrey:  Right.\n\nQ:  I understand why you kept all your notebooks.  [laughter]\n\nJaffrey:  I just don’t like throwing anything away, so they just stayed there.  I have to decide what to do with them.  I have to give them to somebody.\n\nQ:  Did you feel any conflict—conflict is perhaps not the right word.  Was it at all hard to balance doing so many things at the same time?\n\nJaffrey:  No.  You get up in the day and you do whatever you do in the day, and sometimes it was this and sometimes it was that.  It’s like looking after kids, cooking.  Women are used to juggling twenty things.\n\nQ:  When you had to leave New York, Sanford was here?\n\nJaffrey:  Sanford was here, yes.  Eventually the kids were old enough, eventually, but originally, when they were little, Sanford was here.  For the speaking engagements, it would be like one-night things and back, you know, so I tried managing it, traveling very little when they were little, and then increasing it as they got older and older.\n\nQ:  You continued to work with the BBC, and this one mentions both Far Eastern Cookery—\n\nJaffrey:  That was a lovely series that they did, very wonderful series in eight countries on the Far East: Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, Hong Kong, Philippines.  Gosh, I can’t even remember them all.  Have I covered everything?  Anyway, there were eight, and it was so much for them that they divided it between two directors and each went back and forth.  It was a year’s worth of shooting, but I had to stay on for most of it because I was the constant.\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, you were collecting recipes from a wider world perspective, from the Far East, that I guess you were eventually able to put to use.\n\nJaffrey:  And the book that went with the series, it’s always bigger than what you show.\n\nQ:  There’s another series, BBC Radio 4, “six-part series on the history of food from manual to microwave.”\n\nJaffrey:  That was great.\n\nQ:  What was that?\n\nJaffrey:  That was wonderful.  That was a radio series.  The English get very serious on radio.  It was food and medicine, food and industry, food and—I can’t even remember all the parts of it.  Food and industry, food and health, medicine, food and war, the Army marches on its stomach, and then just looking around the world and seeing what actually happened.  It was very, very interesting.\n\tI know about food and medicine in India and China and Far East.  We went to France for various things.  We were looking at the start of the wine industry using the Irish—like the Wild Geese and all these people coming from Ireland to start wineries in France, and we were looking at all that.  I was asking people about the medicinal part of it and what they considered medicine in France.  This doctor told us this wonderful story which we used, because we interviewed a lot of people, and he said for bedwetting, the best cure—and you have to hear this with a French accent; I can’t do it so well—the best cure for bedwetting is to eat a mouse.  So if a child wet his bed, they were forced to eat a mouse.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nJaffrey:  And that stopped them bedwetting, the fear.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Good lord.\n\nJaffrey:  So we interviewed people like [Simon] Schama, and the guy who wrote the book on sugar.  What’s his name?  John Hopkins.  Sidney Mintz.  We interviewed very interesting people.  I think he was in food and industry.  It’s such a fascinating book on how sugar changed the world, apart from the slaves, all the way to the industry, how it was introduced into England and how the English were made to drink tea with sugar, high tea, and how it all came about.  Tate & Lyle, their money comes from sugar, Tate.\n\nQ:  Sugar was not a natural thing to have with tea?\n\nJaffrey:  They had no tea.\n\nQ:  I meant in India.  Certainly not in China yet.\n\nJaffrey:  No.  We didn’t drink tea in the same way in India at all, to begin with.  We learned the British way from the British, and they deliberately introduced it, because it was being drunk like this, China tea, as they called it, in handleless little cups and small amounts, without any milk or sugar or anything in it.  Then the British had to sell sugar to the English, to begin with, and they sold rum, that was one form which they even sold to the people who were growing the sugar, and the other was the barons, sugar barons like Tate, the museum guy, their family, Tate & Lyle, same thing, same family.\n\nQ:  For heaven sakes.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  Same family.  So they are the ones who gave rations of sugar to factory workers, so then they began—\n\nQ:  To get them hooked?\n\nJaffrey:  To get them hooked on sugar.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nJaffrey:  You should read that book, Sidney Mintz’s book on sugar.  So then people started drinking milk and having bread and butter and jam, and that became supper for the English factory worker.  He came home, he had his cup of tea with milk and sugar, lots of sugar, with very simple bread and butter, whatever else he could have, and that became supper or dinner.\n\nQ:  That’s fascinating.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.\n\nQ:  By 1991, you were among ten people honored by New York Magazine who have changed the way New York eats.  That’s a very big deal.  Did it seem that way to you?\n\nJaffrey:  That’s when the honors start, in the nineties.\n\nQ:  Your honors.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, because I’m getting older, I suppose.  [laughter]  Somebody went, “Oh, god, we’d better do something about her.”  I have a similar one from Governor Pataki.  Sanford says that all the blacks are picked up and honored in history in February.  Well, there’s a History Month, which is around the same time, Women’s History Month or something like that.  So whatever woman they can find that’s not white, they say, “Okay, let’s look around for the old ones.”  So I got honored by Pataki.  So it just started then, because they’re always looking for, “What have we not got this time?”  So that started.\n\nQ:  Did you continue to teach here?\n\nJaffrey:  I stopped teaching in the nineties, probably.  It was just too much.  I was working, doing too many things, and as I said, I was doing it all by myself, setting up the classes, typing out all the recipes to be used in the classes, and I wasn’t making all that much money, you know.  It was just not a worthwhile deal.  So I thought, I can teach on television.  It’s much easier.  I can teach with my books, and the return is better, and I have peace and quiet in the home, because the children would come in, sneak in if a class was going on.  Sanford would sneak in.  [laughs]  It was just difficult.\n\nQ:  You must have been very comfortable on television.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  I still am.  I’m comfortable.  I mean, that’s my background, so I’m comfortable on a stage of any sort, except when acting.  Then all the terrors come back.  But if I’m just talking, I can talk.\n\nQ:  Are there still terrors?\n\nJaffrey:  Every actor has terrors, yes.  Opening-night terrors.  “Will I forget the lines?” terrors on the stage, all that.\n\nQ:  I guess it has to do with being appreciated or liked or applauded?\n\nJaffrey:  No, it’s just the fright of being alone and you’re carrying something, yet I have no fright when I talk, because my life is not hanging by a thread.  But on the stage, it is.\n\nQ:  Do you have agents for both your writing and for your theatrical work?\n\nJaffrey:  In England and here, yes.\n\nQ:  When did that start?\n\nJaffrey:  Fairly early.  I’ve had literary agents and acting agents probably from the sixties, seventies, both there and here.\n\nQ:  I guess the act of having these agents must have made each one of those activities seem quite professional.  I mean, they were quite professional, but—\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, and made it easier, because I didn’t have to deal with the legal aspect of anything.\n\nQ:  A Taste of the Far East, the Clarkson Potter 1993 book, those recipes, did they come out, in part, of your going around to—\n\nJaffrey:  No.  Taste of the Far East, I think it was started by Pavilion in England, the other ones who started it, and Clarkson Potter, whoever bought it here, just bought the book, but it was an English book to begin with, a Pavilion book.\n\nQ:  But nevertheless, it looks like that’s the one that won two James Beard Awards.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  It’s a beautiful book.\n\nQ:  One Cookbook of the Year was the other, I guess, Asian or something like that?\n\nJaffrey:  I can’t remember.  It’s probably there.  If it’s my book, it will be there.\n\nQ:  What was Two Rooms?\n\nJaffrey:  It was a wonderful play by Lee Blessing.  I was so happy to get the part, because I wasn’t playing an Indian; I was just a State Department official.\n\nQ:  Your father must have been pleased about that.  [laughter]\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  I got it some way or the other.  But he was dead by that time.\n\nQ:  I see.\n\nJaffrey:  That was at the Signature Theatre, which I loved doing.  I was so happy with that.\n\nQ:  So it was at the Signature Theatre in sort of the same way the Signature Theatre functions now?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, same people.  Same people.  And I just auditioned for it, just went in for an audition.\n\nQ:  There are an awful lot of books after this, Quick and Easy Indian Cookery, An Indian Spice Kitchen, another children’s book, Market Days.\n\nJaffrey:  That’s that one I mentioned to you.\n\nQ:  Madhur Jaffrey’s Flavors of India.  How did you come up with new ideas for focuses for cookbooks?\n\nJaffrey:  I just think about it, and if it interests me in some way, then if it requires research or thought, and if I’m not repeating myself in some way, I will do it.  I need to challenge myself.  I can’t just do the same thing.  People would say to me, “Why don’t you just put some of this and some of that together?”  People do books like that.  I say, “I can’t do that.  You can do it,” and they’ve done it.  That’s why they say I have thirty books.  I don’t.  Because [publishers have often put bits of my books together to create a ‘new’ book.] When you say I have fifteen and sixteen books, they’re all books that I wanted to do, and they tell a particular aspect of food.  They reveal something that has not been revealed before, hopefully. \n\nQ:  The launch of a line of sauces and chutneys, that was different.\n\nJaffrey:  Purely monetary decision.  Purely monetary.  I was approached, offered a lot of money in England, and asked if I would do it, and I said yes.\n\nQ:  What was it?\n\nJaffrey:  It was literally a line of sauces by a company that, until then, just sold—it was a huge, rich company selling rice, Indian rice and teas in England and the world.  Big name.  So they had approached me, and I said yes.  It would be exciting to work with the developers, try and make it as natural to real Indian food as possible.  And even though I knew that there would have to be preservatives in it of some sort if it was going to last a year on the shelf, I thought I would do it because I needed the money.  It was a clear commercial decision on my part.  I’m not a purist in that sense.  I like pure things, but if there’s a way of making money that I can justify in some way, I will do it.\n\nQ:  Had Sanford been working for the symphony a very long time?\n\nJaffrey:  He did.  He worked for fifteen years.  Then he left.  He left in the eighties.\n\nQ:  Because around that time, musicians didn’t make a great deal of money.\n\nJaffrey:  No, no.  I mean, I had to work.  This is the thing.  I had kids in colleges, you know.  I had to work.  There was no question that I needed to work and I needed to make money.\n\nQ:  Your honors were a lot to you.  You must have felt quite good about that part of things.\n\nJaffrey:  I did.  They were rewards.  They were wonderful rewards.\n\nQ:  Was your mother still alive?\n\nJaffrey:  No.\n\nQ:  What does your family think of what you do?\n\nJaffrey:  They ignore it.  My family, as it exists, this kind of success means very little to them.  When I talk to my sister in India, she doesn’t create anything, you know but I think she is a step ahead of me in the development of her soul.  [laughs]  My family doesn’t understand [my need to keep pushing].  They say, “Why are you exhausting yourself running around like this?”  I can’t explain, but I am a different person.\n\nQ:  The Silver Spoon Award [in Food Arts magazine], to me, is a big deal because of what that represents.\n\nJaffrey:  That’s Michael Batterberry and it’s our own people, you know.\n\nQ:  Yes.  I’m trying to think how to describe it for these purposes.  They are people of considerable achievement one way or another, that Food Arts feels they want to designate with a Silver Spoon.\n\nJaffrey:  Right.\n\nQ:  I’m noticing a reissue of An Invitation to Indian Cooking in ’99.  Do you know if that was the first time it was redone?\n\nJaffrey:  I can’t remember.  You’d have to check that with Echo Press and Harper.  What’s his name?  First name?  He’s a wonderful guy.  Echo Press is the one that did it.\n\nQ:  It looks like, in the first decade of this century, that you were doing a lot of acting, a lot of writing.  You haven’t slowed down at all.\n\nJaffrey:  I keep saying I will, I will, I will, but I can’t seem to.\n\nQ:  What was Flawless about?\n\nJaffrey:  Flawless, I was so excited by the thought of doing anything with [Robert] De Niro, because he was such a hero of mine, after [Marlon] Brando.  It was a film about a man who had a stroke.  The part that concerned me was that he’s had a stroke and he’s angry and he’s resisting any kind of treatment, and I play his therapist, who helps him with his treatment.  But the interesting thing for me was that I thought, oh, I’m going to get to know De Niro because I have these two wonderful scenes with him and we talk and we chat.  Well, he’s had a stroke and he doesn’t talk and he walks with a limp.  So when we were introduced, he was not talking and he was walking with a limp.  He was in character.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  So, no smalltalk on the set.\n\nJaffrey:  No smalltalk.  Zilch.\n\nQ:  What got you to the Royal Court, Last Dance at Dum-Dum?\n\nJaffrey:  That was this wonderful, wonderful playwright [Ayub Khan-Din] from Pakistani English, born in England.  Did you see his film called East is East?  It was made into a film as well.\n\nQ:  No.\n\nJaffrey:  He grew up in a large family.  I don’t remember how many kids there were, but at least eight or nine, if not ten.  I can’t remember.  And all boys except for perhaps one girl.  I can’t remember now.  But anyway, they were brought up in north England by a very strict Pakistani father, and they all rebelled in their own ways.  So East is East is a comedy done first at the Royal Court in London. It was his first play.\nThen his next play was Last Dance at Dum-Dum, and he came here to see me and sort of offered me the part after we met.  It was about the Anglo-Indian community in Calcutta, sort of the last of the Anglo-Indian community in Calcutta.\n\nQ:  And what did you play?\n\nJaffrey:  I played the lead.  I can’t even remember the name of the woman, but one of the Anglican women.  So we did it in London and then we went on tour all over England with it.  So that was wonderful also for me.\n\nQ:  I have next Chutney Popcorn and, the same year, Cotton Mary.\n\nJaffrey:  Right.  Chutney Popcorn—you must rent and see these films, actually.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJaffrey:  Chutney Popcorn is the first big film by a young, new Indian American director [Nisha Ganatra], and she’s gay.  The film is about a lesbian relationship, and I’m the mother of two daughters, one straight and one gay.  It’s a comedy and it’s really fun and well done, I think.\n\nQ:  Do you have any feelings about the difference between working on the stage and working in film?\n\nJaffrey:  No, no.  I just think it’s easier to work on film because once you’ve done it, you’ve done it.  You don’t have to keep doing it as you do on the stage, so it’s harder in ways.  You project differently.  But I think I like them equally.\n\nQ:  Tell me how Cotton Mary came about and what that was.\n\nJaffrey:  It’s a long, unhappy story, as far as I’m concerned.  A friend of my niece’s wrote it, and this particular niece happens to be in America, lives in America and is married to an American, but he’s a very strange American.  His father and grandfather were missionaries in India.  They are from Cape Cod, but they were American missionaries in India.  He was brought up in India, as my niece was.  He went to that school in Mussoorie [Woodstock].\n\nQ:  I do know what you mean.  I can’t think of it right now.\n\nJaffrey:  Then they sent him eventually to Oberlin, and my niece went to Oberlin because one of my daughters was at Oberlin, and they met there and they got married.  One of her best friends was the lady who wrote the screenplay.  So she brought it to me, and I took it on, with the idea of directing it, and we worked on it for several years.  Her husband was posted here and then in Bombay.  He was in the Foreign Service at that time, was a lawyer but had gone into the Foreign Service.  He was posted in Bombay, then he was posted in Paris, and we were sending these letters back and forth, and working on the screenplay together.  We did this for a couple of years.\n\tThen I suggested that we show it to Ismail, and Ismail was going to produce it.  Lo and behold, long story short, one day he was directing it, and I was really upset and mad, and I washed my hands of it.  I said, “You do it.  Cast anyone you want.”\n\tHe said, “You can’t do both.  You can’t act and direct.”\n\tI said, “I don’t want to act in it.  I want to direct it.  That was my whole dream.”\n\tWell, again, Ismail, you know how he is.  He went on and on and push and pull, difficult days, and eventually I said okay, and he directed it and I acted in it, but he gave me credit as co-director, though I did nothing, actually, except in the early days when I really helped with the script, absolutely from beginning to end.\n\nQ:  Was directing another skill that you wanted to have?\n\nJaffrey:  That I was dying to have, and I thought with Jim and Ismail’s help, I could do it.  I couldn’t do it on my own because I hadn’t studied it, but I knew I could visually—I have a very good visual sense—I could do it of technical people were helping me.  But then it just disappeared.\n\nQ:  In your autobiography, you talk about your mother’s influence in terms of your wanting to excel.  How does that play out, do you think?\n\nJaffrey:  Everything she did, as I said, she wasn’t educated.  She’d gone to the eighth grade, and [after she died], we found all these—I think I told you, all these medals and things that she’d won as a student, but it hadn’t gone beyond that.  So what did she do?  She did the things women do.  She embroidered, but perfectly.  That thing that you see there, that little crownlike thing, she made that.  One was for herself and the other was for her eldest son when he was born.  You know, when your horoscope is made, they tie that [on the heads of the mother and the baby like crowns.]  Anyway, everything.  Her clothes were beautiful.  She just had perfect taste.  She sewed perfectly.  Her food was perfect.  Everything she did, everything she touched was neat, clean, and perfect.\n\nQ:  Do you think you got some of your drive from her?\n\nJaffrey:  She had no drive.  My father had no drive.  I think I get it from my grandfather or something.  Certainly not from them.\n\nQ:  She had a drive in the sense of excellence in the activities.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, but nothing beyond the house.  No dreams of the world or anything.  It was just in the house.  Very quiet, never talked up, as it were, never contradicted my father, you know.  But in her own way, she did everything so well, that I think that sense of perfection I get from her.\nI get my love of eating and the garden and all that from my father, who loved gardening, not that he did it himself.  There was a mali to do the work, but he supervised everything.  He wanted his garden to look a certain way, and he got all the trees, he got all the plants, he ordered all the seeds.  So I inherited that aspect of my father.\n\nQ:  I can’t remember if it’s in your book or not, but there’s a reference to him doing a little bit of catering and your tagging along, for weddings.\n\nJaffrey:  No, he didn’t do the catering.  The caterers came.  The caterers come and they set up tents, and these were special, wonderful caterers.  You’ve probably been to one of these things at weddings.  He would supervise the caterers, to make sure that everything was going well, because he was very interested in what they were doing.\n\nQ:  How young were you at that point when you would tag along?\n\nJaffrey:  From probably three, four.\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, you continued to do BBC documentaries, to win awards.  It’s all a lot.  [laughter]  It is.  You’re not slowing down at all.\n\nJaffrey:  No.  I really, really say that, but I get so anxious when I’m not doing anything.\n\nQ:  I understand completely.  The EastEnders I didn’t expect to find.\n\nJaffrey:  That just came out of the blue.  Again, it was an acting job and I was not getting enough of them.  This is seen by everybody.  They just showed my set of episodes in the last month, and people were talking to me here about it, so obviously it’s shown everywhere.\n\nQ:  Was it fun?\n\nJaffrey:  It was.  It really was.  I was the matriarch in a particular Indian family in this thing, and I met a whole lot of young kids who were of Indian origin, but they weren’t Indian kids.  They knew nothing about India—they would ask questions like, “Are you Punjabi?”  [And they said that they did not know!] I thought, you know, in India everybody knows what state they come from.  They had no clue, and they weren’t curious about it either.\n\nQ:  What made you decide to write Climbing the Mango Trees?\n\nJaffrey:  I did not want to write an autobiography of any kind.  My editor in England kept saying, “You should do one.  You should do one.”  And finally I said I would, but I wouldn’t go beyond twenty-one.  So at least that would protect this part of the family, and somehow everything else has a little distance and many people are dead.  But then when I began writing it, I realized that I couldn’t even go beyond eighteen.  It was just too difficult and too many people involved.  It’s been hurtful to a lot of people, so when people say, “We want to know what happened when you came to America,” I do want to write that, I do want to write what happened in America, but if I could leave the family out in some way, I would write it.\n\nQ:  It was hurtful because people didn’t like the way they were described?\n\nJaffrey:  Sometimes they were wonderful descriptions, like how much I adored them, how beautiful they were, but, like my sister, who was so beautiful, didn’t enjoy being called beautiful.  She said, “No, no, no.”  They’re very private.  They’re very, in their own way, conservative.  They’re not conservatives, but conservative.\n\nQ:  Tell me where you write and how.  Do you write on the computer now?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, I write on the computer.\n\nQ:  Do you need silence, lots of time?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, I need silence, and I’ll do it at night.  There’s no set time.  Some people are very disciplined.  I’m not, because I do so many things.  So when I have time, I do it.  When I’m working on a cookbook, I’m always behind, or any book.  I’m behind, so I’m always rushing at the end.  I can do eighteen-hour days.  I do them every time towards the end.  I’m also highly motivated at that time to get it all right and finished.\n\nQ:  Tell me about the Law and Order episodes.  Do you enjoy doing those?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, it’s fun, fun meeting—it’s an acting job.  It’s not a great acting job, because I haven’t had parts in Law and Order that really stand out in any way.  It’s a job.\n\nQ:  You haven’t killed anyone.\n\nJaffrey:  No.  [laughs]  I haven’t killed anyone.  One of the things I did, something on Psych, I was going to be a suspect, at least, but they sort of killed that aspect of it, so then I was just an ordinary character.  Sometimes television here and there, but nothing I would say, “You must see this.”  It’s okay.  Just jobs.\n\nQ:  What kind of acting do you want to do now?\n\nJaffrey:  I would love to do something really worthwhile on the stage and on film.  It doesn’t really matter where it is, whether it’s television or stage.  It just has to be a part that makes sense, that has a beginning, middle, and end, and goes somewhere.\n\nQ:  I suppose that’s not easy to come by at all these days.\n\nJaffrey:  Not for me, no. \n\nQ:  Because of—\n\nJaffrey:  I’m thought of as Indian, you know.  I would rather be thought of as just a woman.\n\nQ:  What are you working on now?\n\nJaffrey:  I don’t really like to talk about that, because nothing is settled.  I have several things possible right now that I will probably get decided next month, but until they get decided, I’d rather not talk about them, only because it may not happen.\n\nQ:  When you are at loose ends, do you care whether it’s writing or acting?\n\nJaffrey:  No.  I would die for a good acting job, but there have been just so many almost things.  I mean, I almost did a wonderful series which was going to be incredible, and we shot three episodes—it wasn’t even a pilot.  We shot three episodes and then it got cancelled.  Things like that have happened, so I just now stay off it, don’t discuss it till it’s actually going to happen.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Is there anything we haven’t talked about that you feel you would like to talk about?\n\nJaffrey:  No, not really.  You may have questions once you’ve put it all together.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you tell me what you’re making for dinner tonight and why, because it’s so contemporary.\n\nJaffrey:  It’s so odd what I’m doing.  We had been to one of these food festivals that you go to and people give you things.  So we’d been given these gorgeous Allen Brothers steaks, you know.  So they were sitting in the freezer.  I have this one grand-nephew, as I said, who loves meat and his whole version of America is that he’s going to get a lot of meat.  So I invited two of the kids—a grand nephew and a grand niece.  He loves meat and she loves vegetarian food.  So she said she couldn’t come.  So we planned this whole thing and it was going to be Western.  It was going to be either scalloped potatoes with it or potatoes with rosemary and garlic or something like that, and then maybe some squash, some little Western food and a steak, or steaks, these great, lovely pieces of meat from Allen Brothers.\nBut now she’s called this morning and said, “Actually, no, I think I can come.”  So I said, “Okay, fine.  We’d love to have you.”  [laughter]  So now I’m going to do the steaks, but I would put a few Indian spices on them, so the meat is sort of slightly leaning a little bit, maybe cumin, maybe ginger or something on it, and I will cook the steaks the regular way, but on the side I would have dal, which I’m making, and some rice and maybe three or four vegetables done in a slightly Indian way so the grand-niece can have her vegetarian food.\n\nQ:  It sounds like it will be very delicious in any case.\n\tThank you so much for doing this.\n\nJaffrey:  Thank you.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tJaffrey - 2 -  PAGE 57\n\n\n\n","description":"Few American cooks were able to produce authentic Indian food until Madhur Jaffrey's 1973 An Introduction to Indian Cooking. The book demystified Indian food and in a way, was a reflection of her own introduction to Indian cooking, once she left New Delhi to pursue an acting career in England and America. Like many upper class Indian women, Jaffrey hadn't learned to cook as a child. Once she left home, she longed for the food of her childhood. Letters from her mother as well as Jaffrey's own strong sense of taste set her on her way.\r\n\r\nA well-known Indian actress, Jaffrey was at home in front of cameras and. As her food writing career developed, that experience made her a natural for television. Since that first cookbookâ€”then praised by New York Times food critic Craig Claiborne as \"perhaps the best Indian cookbook available in English\"â€”she has written 28 more, many of them in tandem with multiple television series both in the United States and the UK. She has also written countless newspaper and magazine articles, and continued a much-praised acting career.","identifier":"madhur-jaffrey","label":"Madhur Jaffrey","url":"/interviews/madhur-jaffrey/index.html","name":"Madhur Jaffrey","sort":"jaffrey","handle":null},{"@search.action":"upload","content":"Judith Jones first made her mark in publishing as a young woman working in the Paris office of Doubleday, when she came upon a manuscript of The Diary of Anne Frank in a reject pile and enthusiastically recommended it for publication. That star turn gave her considerable credibility when, back in the United States working as an editor for Knopf, she urged the publishing house to pay attention to an unsolicited manuscript by Julia Child, Louisette Bertholle, and Simone Beck that would become Mastering the Art of French Cooking.\r\n\r\nA prominent fiction editor already, Jones went on to discover and edit not only the rest of Julia Child's books, but also books by some of the most successful cookbook authors in America, including Madhur Jaffrey, Marcella Hazan, Irene Kuo, Edna Lewis, and Joan Nathan. More than any other figure in publishing, she has helped to change the way America thinks about food. She has also authored books, both with her late husband Evan Jones and on her own.

I am with Judith Jones in her apartment in Manhattan.  It’s April 27, 2009, and we’re about to start.\n\tGood afternoon, Judith.  Thank you for having me here.  Could we start by your telling us a little bit about when and where you were born specifically and a little bit about your childhood?\n\nJones:  I was born in New York City, and, actually, when I was four years old, we came to this apartment building that we’re in now.  It’s one of the old buildings.  About six families got together and bought it, and we weathered the Depression just barely.  And it’s sort of fun to have come back later in life.  Now I’m the matriarch of the building.  But it’s full of memories for me and particularly memories of some of the shops that we went to.  I remember Mr. Volpe’s grocery store, and in winter you had about five things, a couple of old gnarled root vegetables and onions and potatoes, and that was about it.\n\nQ:  Where was that?\n\nJones:  It was on—I think it was, 65th and Third.  We’re on 66th.\n\nQ:  Everything’s changed so much.\n\nJones:  Yes.  But then you lived with the seasons, and I remember the excitement when the first asparagus would come and the peas, and there was nothing but iceberg lettuce in those days.\n\tAnd we had a maid of all work.  It was amazing what those maids did.  She made three meals a day and cleaned up, and she cleaned house and so on.\n\nQ:  The woman that you write about did all the cleaning as well as all that spectacular cooking?\n\nJones:  Yes.  And she had a little room back there, which is now my study, and I just was fascinated by her, I think partly because I loved to watch her cook.  I think it’s in the genes.  I mean, my sister didn’t give a hang about cooking, but I would come home from school and perch myself in the kitchen and watch Edie cook and ask her about the kinds of things that she ate because—\n\nQ:  She was from Barbados?\n\nJones:  Yes.  Yes.  Our food was strictly good English food, you know, no garlic.\n\nQ:  No garlic, no onions, nothing.\n\nJones:  No onions.  We would get just enough onions for a lamb stew, enough for one portion each, but bad to have them left over, because they might sneak into something else.\n\nQ:  I’ve never understood why they bothered people.  Do you have any idea why your mother didn’t like them?\n\nJones:  I think there was a certain snobbery—\n\nQ:  Oh, interesting.\n\nJones:  —that you smelled of onions, you smelled of garlic.  You know that next morning smell of garlic that you get on the metro in Paris.  [laughs]  It was frowned upon, because the whole attitude towards food then was that it was good fuel, and you bought carefully, you had a balanced, good diet, but that was it.  You weren’t supposed to enjoy it, at least the English tradition, the Puritan tradition.\n\nQ:  You must have thought about why that was the case.\n\nJones:  Why it was?\n\nQ:  That you weren’t supposed to enjoy it or talk about it.\n\nJones:  Well, I do think it went back to Puritan things, to Puritan attitudes.  Anything, the physical was just, yes, you do it to keep alive.  Like sex, how you have to procreate, but you’re not supposed to enjoy it.  [laughs]  And I really think that, and then the fact that in the nineteenth century the food industry got very smart about the food business and exploited this idea that women didn’t really want to cook, that it was demeaning, that we were supposed to be educated, and you just didn’t want to spend all that time in the kitchen getting your hands dirty.  And people bought it. Then I love the way they tried to turn cooking into a science, domestic science.  Jim Beard is so funny on that subject.\n\nQ:  We can talk about that a little bit later.  What about that do you think appealed to your mother?\n\nJones: What?\n\nQ:  The other, the food science or that she didn’t belong in the kitchen?\n\nJones:  She just didn’t want to be in the kitchen.  It was demeaning.  You didn’t cook; you had servants who cooked.  I’m afraid it’s very snobbish—my mother came from an English family that went to Canada and then came down to the U.S., and I just think the attitude was deeply rooted.  Whereas on the other hand, my father’s family in Vermont—both his sisters lived within six miles of each other—had such a lusty feeling about good food. I just remember loving that. My aunt’s husband was a local doctor who made the rounds every night, and came home late.  She would cook the most delicious little things and have them waiting, and I could see how much it was an expression of love.\n\nQ:  This was your Aunt Marian?  Is that right?\n\nJones:  My Aunt Marian.\n\nQ:  And you would spend summer occasionally there, or how did you—\n\nJones:  We always went to Vermont all summer long for a good three months.  There was a polio scare, and they had to get the children out of the city.\n\nQ:  Oh, of course.\n\nJones:  We stayed the summer in Montpelier, where my father grew up.  The rest of the time we were on a lake about an hour away.\n\nQ:  And did your aunt do her own cooking?\n\nJones:  Oh, absolutely, and she had a hired girl, as they say, but she wouldn’t let that hired girl do the cooking for her.  She did the cooking for my Uncle Doc.  It was an expression of love, and I think very early on that got to me.\n\tI also wrote in my book, but I think I’ll tell you again here, about my grandmother’s house, a big house on State Street and Bouley Avenue, they used to have these—I don’t know what you call them, in the ceiling so that the air could circulate—these vents, and I’d be upstairs where I could open the vent and look and see what was happening in the kitchen.  I remember one night looking down, and these scruffy-looking men were sitting at the table.  Mrs. Cooney, the cook, said to me afterward, “Well, those are poor, lonely men out of work, and your grandmother told me always to feed them.”  And she said, “There’s a mark on the elm tree outside that tells other hobos,” as they were known, “that this is a safe place, and they’ll always give you a meal.” Then she showed me the mark on the trees.  I can remember that.  I almost wanted to cry—I sensed that this is what it’s all about.\n\nQ:  It must have been an astonishing idea, really.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  When you were here in New York, nevertheless, you did grow up with things, perhaps because of the fruits and vegetable vendor, that some people didn’t have, or certainly that I didn’t grow up with.  You talk about artichokes as being a favorite food.  You had innards.  You had things that have recently become back into fashion.  I was just interested that they were part of your family diet.  Was that Edie or was that—\n\nJones:  Well, I think it was Mr. Volpe, the Italian on the corner, and I think he probably introduced them to us. But I don’t know, because my mother didn’t go out shopping.  She’d get on the phone.  It was very much the style those days.  So, about artichokes?  I suspect it was old Mr. Volpe, and they were just becoming a little bit fashionable because they served them at ladies’ lunches, to be eaten leaf by leaf.  If you didn’t know how to eat them, you learned fast in order to be socially correct.\n\nQ:  And what about the innards?\n\nJones:  Well, that’s English.  Lamb kidneys, veal kidneys, sweetbreads.  We didn’t have brains.  We didn’t have tripe.\n\nQ:  Have to be French for those, I guess.\n\nJones: And, of course, liver.  Liver was good for you too.\n\nQ:  Could you talk about the occasional Saturday lunches you had with your father?\n\nJones:  Yes.  Just down the street, I think it was East 60th or 61st, there was a little French restaurant called La Petite Maison, and my father liked good food, and I guess he sensed that I did too.  He would start to take me to lunch on Saturdays, and we particularly liked this La Petite Maison.\n\nQ:  This is just you, not your siblings or—\n\nJones:  Well, sometimes the whole family went, but he and I would maybe sneak off together—we had a very close relationship—and say we were doing some shopping, and then we’d stop in.\n\tUnfortunately, there was one particular thing I loved, which was a seafood crepe, and the idea of rolling up wonderful seafood in this little pancake, thin pancake appealed to me, but unfortunately I got sick, and really sick.  I mean, I was throwing up.  And Mother just stood there and said, “Well, what do you expect?  It’s French food.  They’re disguising things that are rotten.”  [laughs]  Anyway, item by item, we sorted out the culprit and it came down to scallops, and a lot of people have an allergy to scallops.\n\tBut the thing that I loved is that my husband, who grew up as a Christian Scientist —although he no longer was one, it had shaped his thinking about certain things—he wouldn’t accept that someone had an allergy and couldn’t get over it.  He wasn’t trying to poison me, but he would slip a little bit of scallops into a fish stew, and a little more next time, and after a period of years, he confessed what he was doing.\n\nQ:  Oh, you didn’t know?\n\nJones:  I didn’t know.\n\nQ:  Oh, what luck.\n\nJones:  Yes.  And one night I was able to eat a whole plate of scallops, and I’ve been making up for it ever since.\n\nQ:  In this atmosphere, how did you learn anything about cooking, yourself?\n\nJones:  I learned by watching Edie more, and I learned with Aunt Marian, because she would have me make things.  She’d say, “Whip up the eggs.”  So those were the two big influences.  I don’t know.  I was just sort of brave.  When we were in college, during summer vacations the parents of a friend of mine let us live up on Riverside Drive because the parents’ apartment was empty, and so we were two or three bachelor girls together, and we loved giving dinner parties.  And I did all the cooking.  I don’t know where I got it from.\n\nQ:  That’s amazing.  Well, go back a little bit.  At one point, you asked to cook for your father during the summer.\n\nJones:  Oh yes.\n\nQ:  How old would you have been?\n\nJones:  I think I was about fifteen.\n\nQ:  How did you get the nerve to do that?\n\nJones:  I don’t know.  It’s very interesting how little you know yourself, and when I came to write this book, I looked at some of the letters I wrote home when I was in Paris—I’m, jumping ahead a little bit—and thought who is this girl?  How is she so confident, so manipulative, so sassy?  [laughs]  But I don’t know.  As a child, I was more or less the shy one, but I was very determined.  And I loved the Vermont side of my family, so I really wanted to stay with them one winter, just to have that experience of going to school in the snow.\n\nQ:  What was it about them that was so different from your New York family?\n\nJones:  I think they were just warmer and more partying and fun, and my grandmother was quite naughty.  She was always trying to get me away from my homework so we could go to the movies together.\n\nQ:  Oh, how grand.\n\nJones:  And we’d have a big milkshake across the street at Jackson’s pharmacy.  See, she had that childish naughtiness in her.\n\nQ:  Now, speaking of milkshakes, you wrote about a very embarrassing incident to you when you were a child when you were put on this scale by someone.\n\nJones:  Oh yes.\n\nQ:  Could you play that out, put that in context a little bit?  I thought it was an incredibly cruel thing to do to a child, but you tell us.\n\nJones:  Well, it was supposed to be just a joke.  First of all, my mother and her sister—they’re both slim—used to kind of pinch me and say, “Oh, she’s going to be the plump one of the family.  She’s a Bailey.”  Well, of course, I liked being a Bailey.  That was my father’s name.  But the plumpness kind of bothered me, and I didn’t really think I was plump.\n\tThen I went to visit a schoolmate—Eleanor Freedley—and visit her parents.  Vincent Freedley was a well-known theatrical producer then and had this wonderful house in Connecticut. They always served fabulous food—I can remember iced tea and little sandwiches out on the lawn and the huge dinners.  I was just thoroughly enjoying myself when Mr. Freedley said to me, “Do you always eat this much?”  Or, “Do you always eat this way?”  Then he said, teasingly, “How much do you weigh?”\n\tI don’t know, I said, a hundred.  Maybe I was about a hundred and fifteen then.\n\tAnd he said, “I don’t believe it,” and he took me in to his bathroom and put me on the scales, and I went.  I weighed over a hundred and twenty, and he came laughing back.  But, you know, I didn’t feel so terribly humiliated. I just felt  I’m somebody who has to watch her weight.\n\nQ:  And you were a young teenager?\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  In the middle of a big meal, I might add.  [laughter]  So there were a few pounds in you that might not have been at other times.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  How did you then deal with that?\n\nJones:  Well, at school I was awfully strict with myself.  I literally had something like a raw carrot for lunch or an apple or—\n\nQ:  How did you do that?\n\nJones:  I don’t know.  I couldn’t do it now.\n\nQ:  Do you remember it being difficult?\n\nJones:  Yes, I do.  I do.  It often leads to anorexia, and I might well have been susceptible. But I never went too far.  I never upchucked.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  And perhaps it was partly because it wasn’t your own family where that incident took place.\n\nJones:  Then I think what I really learned later is that it’s important to eat in proportion to your weight, your appetite, how much energy you use.  I learned all this in France, I mean, that if you just eat well, a little of everything, you’re okay.\n\nQ:  What about your years at Bennington, what was the food like there?\n\nJones:  It was extremely good, because I think I picked Bennington for its food.  I visited Wellesley, I visited Smith, and the dreary food put me off.  Bennington prided itself on fresh-squeezed orange juice every morning.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Oh, that’s fascinating.\n\nJones:  I sometimes waited on table.  I didn’t do much of it, but you could see that they got the produce fresh from the farmers, and then during the war they had a victory garden.  Kenneth Burke, the literary critic, would be out in the fields with his students.  He loved conducting his classes out there and having our hands in the soil while our minds were soaring.\n\nQ:  Your book makes it seem a little bit as though one of the reasons for going to Paris was to learn more about food and to perfect your skills.  Is that all fair enough?\n\nJones:  I don’t think it was quite conscious, but I loved everything about Paris.  I loved the way women treated their men.  I loved the—\n\nQ:  Ah, now that I’m not going to let you just drop off without explaining.  [laughter]  We’re all eager to hear.\n\nJones:  These English women in my family were always setting such high standards, and they were so critical. They’d be measuring the drinks that their husbands had, and they’d be having them carve the roasts so thin that you hardly got anything. It was so anti-pleasure, anti-lustiness.  And I, obviously, had that streak in me, so I loved the way the French enjoyed life.\n\nQ:  Was deciding to go there an easy thing to do, a bit of a rebellious thing to do?\n\nJones:  Well, I think it was quite rebellious to have stayed.  The initial trip was to be three weeks, it was extended slightly, and then I ended up staying three and a half years.  My parents were, I think, quite concerned about it.\n\nQ:  Concerned about your being, as it were, alone?\n\nJones:  Alone, vulnerable, all those Frenchmen around.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Right.  But you seemed to have—at least the book makes it seem as though it was a fairly easy relationship with the city.\n\nJones:  Oh, it was.  As far as I was concerned, I just decided that—my purse was actually stolen about three days before I was to go home.  You could hardly say stolen, because I put it on the back of the bench and just wandered off.  Now, Freud would not say that was exactly—\n\nQ:  The bag wanted to stay in Paris.  [laughs]\n\nJones:  And it had everything in it.  It had my passport, my travelers’ checks, my identity.  Suddenly, I just thought, “That’s the past.  I’m going to make a new life here.  This is a message.”  And that’s what I think my family had a little hard time with.\n\nQ:  How did you tell them or ask them?\n\nJones:  I didn’t ask them; I told them.  I said, “I’m staying and I’m finding work and this is where I want to be.  Believe in me.”  So they didn’t come over and get me forcibly.\n\nQ:  At that point, well, you’d only been there a brief period of time, but surely you saw the wonderful food markets and the way people shopped and ate.  Talk about how that fit into your image of a new life.\n\nJones:  Well, to me, the food was celebratory. They enjoyed the pleasure of it. The time the French would spend marketing! But they would never count the time.  I mean, they loved going to the charcuterie, the patisserie, the open market.  I remember one French woman told me, “When you first see things, never, never buy when you go the open market.  You go the whole length of it and back again before you buy, and then you have the comparison.”  Well, that seemed so terrific to me.  And then one day in the local boulangerie, I was standing in line to get bread, and suddenly a man broke open a baguette, and he cheered.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nJones:  He passed it around to the other people, and  the whole place was roaring.  I said, “What’s happening?  What’s this about?”\n\tAnd somebody said to me, “The flour is white.” To me that seemed the essence of life.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Could you explain?  I mean, you know by now that the bread had a bad period, both before and after the war when there wasn’t white flour.  But did you realize that that—\n\nJones:  Well, it was explained to me that the flour wasn’t white, that the flour had been impure all through the war, everyone had been getting gray baguettes that didn’t really taste good.\n\tI also can remember some of the dinner parties there, and the idea of food and wine and good talk and the literary life were all a part of it.\n\nQ:  Now, you went with some pretty good connections, invitations to people to call, so that people who were established there could help you make your way around the city.  Did that make it easier?\n\nJones:  Yes.  Oh, it certainly did, and the people were so generous.  I mean, they wanted to show this young American around.  I had met Arthur Koestler here in New York, and he sort of took a fancy to this young girl going off to Paris, and told me what kind of wine I should order and gave me all these letters of introduction.  One of them was to [André] Malraux.\n\nQ:  That’s pretty good.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  On a scale of letters of introduction.\n\nJones:  I never heard from [Jean-Paul] Sartre, and I did get a little handwritten note from [Albert] Camus.  Just as well he wasn’t in Paris.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  I hope you saved it.\n\nJones:  I don’t think I did.\n\nQ: But Malraux?\n\nJones: Yes, Malraux.  He turned to his assistant secretary and said, “There’s this young American.  Will you help her meet some people? He meant the people who had worked in the Resistance and wanted to get together at the end of the week. So I was taken by his young assistant and I met all these wonderful Frenchmen.  One of them was a very good cook, and he just loved showing me how to cook, how to market, how to order in a country inn.  There is something about the French that—\n\nQ:  In retrospect, was that also a kind of seduction, I mean purposefully, or really he was just trying to show you?\n\nJones:  Well, it may have been a little bit of seduction too, but it was just who he was.  He was a hardworking journalist, and yet every night that he was alone. (I think he invariably had a woman.) He would make a lovely little dinner, and he just enjoyed it as part of life.\n\nQ:  Do you remember if that had happened before you decided to stay or after?\n\nJones:  I had met him before, yes.\n\nQ:  Ah.\n\nJones:  Good question.  [laughs]  Yes, I remember that.\n\nQ:  I can understand that.  What were your cooking skills like at that point?\n\nJones:  Well, they probably were just minimal, because, you see, I hadn’t found in any books or magazines or anything about the techniques of cooking, what makes the difference between just cooking even with good ingredients and sort of throwing it together as against making something soigné, as Julia [Child] always said,  And to me that was always part of the fun, even if you just have a few leftovers in the refrigerator, to turn them into something that you feel, “Mmm, isn’t that good?” after the first bite.\n\nQ:  But looking back, did you have basic skills that you could feed yourself with?\n\nJones:  Yes.  By then I knew how to roast and how to do pan chicken and things like that, but there were so many unfamiliar things, particularly in the whole fish area, and I would ask the fishmonger in Paris, “What would you do with a dorade?”  And he’d tell me, and sometimes he’d bring out his wife.\n\tI remember once the butcher had sold us a little piece of beef, and he said, “Oh, you have to have pomme frites with this.”\n\tAnd I answered, “But I don’t make very good pomme frites.”\n\tSo he replied, “Talk to my wife.”  And he took me over to her, and she told me the proportion of beef fat to pork fat that I should use and gave me a little canister of it. What a difference that kind of thing can make.\n\nQ:  But still very brave for a young cook really to try pomme frites and new kinds of fish.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  It’s interesting to me that you went really from an atmosphere where you couldn’t talk about food to an atmosphere where people talked about food all the time.\n\nJones:  That’s right, yes.  Yes.  Yes.\n\nQ:  And it must have felt—I don’t know, you tell me.\n\nJones:  In these letters home, I said to my parents things like, “I know you didn’t send me to an expensive college to have me become a cook, but in France cooking is an art, not frowned upon, but honored.”  Putting them in their place.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Did you get much response on that?\n\nJones:  Well, I didn’t keep the letters from them.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  I asked you about your skills at that point because I want to ask you about the dinner parties, but I wondered, before you tell me about your dinner parties where people paid, what your skills were like at the point that you decided to do that.  So if you could just describe how all that came about and where.\n\nJones:  Well, yes.  I went to the American Express, which was almost a kind of a club for Americans in Europe at that stage, and I met a young man who’d worked at Doubleday, where I had worked.  I was supposed to go back to a job there.  I told him my plight, that here I was with no money, no job, no apartment.\n\tAnd he said, “Well, listen, come and live in my aunt’s apartment.  It’s huge, and there’s only a painter living down the hallway.” The painter turned out to be Balthus, whom, of course, at that point I’d never heard of, of course.  And he was very welcoming.  We even got a little dog.  [laughter]  I didn’t do so much cooking for them, but I did a little.  Then Paul [Chapin] all of a sudden had this idea, he said, “You know, here we are.  We’ve got a free apartment.  All we need is enough money to eat, and you cook pretty well, and you’ve got this French friend you keep talking about.”  That was the journalist I’d met through Malraux’s secretary who was such a wonderful cook.  “Maybe he’d help us, so we can feed others in order to feed ourselves.”  And there were lots of Americans, homeless Americans, who would love it.\n\tSo we gathered all the little tables around Paul’s aunt’s apartment and found little tablecloths and empty champagne bottles. (He had another aunt who’d married into the Moët & Chandon family.)\n\nQ:  Handy if you need champagne bottles, yes.  [laughter]\n\nJones:  I asked Pierre, the journalist, if he would like to help us.  He just loved the idea.\n\nQ:  Could Paul cook?\n\nJones:  No, not at all, but he could éplucher and do some of the prep work, which is exactly what we did.  We became the slaves, and Pierre would waltz in early in the morning and take me to the market, and I’d hold out the bags.  He’d plunge this and this in, and I’d ask, “What are you going to do with this?”\n\tAnd he’d reply, “Soupe de poisson.”  So all afternoon, Paul and I would be putting the fish flesh through one of  those little fine tamis strainers-- all just for a soup, which seemed quite mad, but lots of fun.  And then Pierre would join us at about seven o’clock and whip up the dinner, and we’d have about twenty people.\n\nQ:  How did you find them, the twenty people?  Or who found them?\n\nJones:  Paul had lots of connections, and they were mostly Marshall Plan young Americans living nearby.\n\nQ:  So people more or less in the same age group?\n\nJones:  More or less, yes. One evening my cousin came over—she was married to John Gunther. And that was quite an evening, because, of course, Pierre was fascinated to meet the great John Gunther, and it was my way of sort of proving to the family that I had become at least a sous chef.\n\nQ:  Did you actually learn a lot about cooking during that period of time?\n\nJones:  Oh, I learned a lot watching him, and I came to understand how important shopping is. Pierre wouldn’t make up his mind what we were going to have until we got to the market, practically.  Then one night, it was only about the third or fourth time we’d served dinner, Pierre was called out of town, and so I made the whole dinner.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  And you shopped for it yourself, or he had already done that?\n\nJones:  I think we shopped for it.  It was fairly simple--it was a chicken dish.  But it was pretty nervy of me.\n\nQ:  And people actually gave you cash, or how did that work?\n\nJones:  Yes, they paid for it.  It was a prix fixe, and we were only open twice a week.  We may have tried to get up to three.  I can’t remember.  But, of course, it wasn’t long before the concierge caught on.\n\tPaul’s aunt, the Princess Caetani was in Rome.  She was the person who sponsored a literary magazine called Botteghe Oscure, and she was quite the character.  She came on the train, and when she arrived, of course, I was trembling.  But she took us out to lunch, Paul and me, and she—\n\nQ:  That’s a fairly classy thing to do under the circumstances.\n\nJones:  Yes, and never a word about the restaurant.  She just remarked to me, “I hear you’re quite a good cook,” she said with a certain amount of contempt.  Then she just added that—I think it was her daughter or a niece was having a wedding and a lot of people were coming so we’d have to get out.  [laughs]  But never, never confronting.\n\nQ:  Saving face for everyone.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  And where did you go then?\n\nJones:  Oh, lots of different places. First we went off to the south of France for about a week or so, sort of to recover.  I just sort of lived hand to mouth.\n\nQ:  The book has this story that you tell about how you made a list of people to contact to get a job and how your future husband was the last on the list, and you heard a friend speaking to him and then grabbed the phone.  I have tried to put that together in my head, with some difficulty, in terms of then what did you do, what did you say to him when you—\n\nJones:  I just said I was looking for a job and I’d heard wonderful things about—\n\nQ:  What was it he was running at the point?\n\nJones:  It was a magazine called Weekend.  It was a Life-like magazine, and he had started it with Stars and Stripes right after the war, and it was quite successful in Germany. He got a lot of good German talent and wonderful photographers to work for him.  But then I think the Deutsche Mark was devalued, and Stars and Stripes felt they couldn’t afford to keep the magazine afloat.  So the men on Weekend all put in their savings into it, and they decided to move to Paris and give it a whirl.\n\nQ:  I see.  They had been in Germany.\n\nJones:  They had been in Germany.  They had about two years of publishing it in Germany.\n\nQ:  I see.  So by the time that you had this conversation with him, how long had it been in Paris?\n\nJones:  Only a month or two, I think.  Yes.\n\nQ:  Oh, I see.\n\nJones:  It was very early on, and they actually had to change the name, they found, because Weekend was already used.  So they changed it to Now.\nSo under those circumstances, all I had written down was Evan Jones and Weekend magazine, which was no longer the right title. And Jones is a pretty common name.  [laughs]  So I didn’t have much to go on, and I’d crossed off on the list all the other prospects I’d seen.  They were very polite, but there was no job.\n\tThen one evening I walked into my little fleabag hotel, where there was just one phone in the lobby-- there were no phones in the bedrooms, and I heard this American on the phone saying, “Weekend, Weekend.”  From what I heard of her conversation, she was an artist.  Fortunately, she wasn’t competing with me for an editorial job.  So when she was finished, I grabbed the phone and asked “Could I speak to Mr. Jones?”  And they put me on, and I guess he liked the sound of my voice.\n\nQ:  Was this in the same building, his office?\n\nJones:  Oh no.  His office was on the Rue Saint-Honoré.\n\nQ:  So you made an appointment or what?\n\nJones:  For the next morning.\n\nQ:  Oh, I see.  I see.\n\nJones:  Right away.  Yes.  And they didn’t have any money, but I think he took sort of a liking to me and gave me a small salary.\n\nQ:  And you did have some publishing background?\n\nJones:  Oh, I did, yes.  I brought some copy I’d written on Gore Vidal’s book and some things that were published in the Bennington literary magazine.\n\nQ:  How soon was it that you realized you shared an interest in food with your future husband, that is to say?\n\nJones:  How did we find out that we did?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJones:  Well, I think it was the very first lunch that we had together.  And I do remember this so clearly, because there was something on the menu called boudin blanc, and I didn’t know what that was and he didn’t know either.  So we asked the waiter, in our stumbling French, and it was explained that at Christmastime they made this special boudin sausage of poultry meat and veal and, of course, truffles and cream, and it was just heavenly. Even more so because we both felt the same way about the pleasure of discovering something delicious and caring.\n\nQ:  I guess what I hadn’t focused on before is that Evan must have made a decision to stay in Europe as well as you had, so that you—\n\nJones:  Yes, he’d had a rather painful separation and his wife had gone back to America with the two children.  In fact, when I went into his office, it was his second daughter’s birthday, and all over the office were pictures of her that the German photographer Hans Hubmann had taken.  It was so touching.  \n\nQ:  So his children were where at that point?\n\nJones:  They were actually in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nQ:  I guess what I’m getting at is that he had decided not to make his life in the United States, I mean not forever but—\n\nJones:  Well, at least to stay on in Paris for a while, trying to keep the magazine afloat. Then that didn’t work, really, because suddenly the whole magazine market opened up, and poor old Weekend Now couldn’t compete with Life and Look.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  No.\n\nJones:  So it went under, and he wanted to stay.  We both wanted to stay.  I think he thought it would be sort of healing to be away for a few years.\n\nQ:  Yes, and how long was it that you both stayed?\n\nJones:  It was almost three years.\n\nQ:  At what point during that time did you get married?\n\nJones:  Not till the end.  [whispers]  And we were living together.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Did your family know you were living together?\n\nJones:  Well, my mother finally came over.\n\nQ:  She caught on?\n\nJones:  She wanted to inspect.\n\nQ:  I see.\n\nJones:  And we were living with a wonderful French woman named Madame Damianos.  We had a bedroom and use of the kitchen.  I told Madame Damianos that my mother was coming and asked her what was I going to do?  And she said, “Don’t worry.  I’ll take all monsieur’s clothes and I’ll put them in my closet, and we’ll give a lovely dinner party for your mother and aunt,” and so that’s what we did.  My mother was looking around.  [laughs]  I don’t think she was ever fooled.\n\nQ:  I think mothers tend to catch on.  Did the two of you make many trips either around France or around Europe?\n\nJones:  We didn’t travel as much as we would have liked because we had no money.  And, you know, I think I learned a lot by not having money because I absorbed the way the French how you make use of every little thing. And I was cooking more because both of us were cooking together, and we had fun making it work.\n\nQ:  At what point did you start to work for Doubleday, in Paris, that is?\n\nJones:  I don’t think it was until 1950.  I was there about a year.  They opened an office and sent—\n\nQ:  You mean you were only at Doubleday a year or so, is that what you mean?\n\nJones:  Yes. Doubleday opened an office in Paris. The man who was sent over, Frank Price really wanted to have a few years in Paris, I think, so he got Doubleday to splurge on an elegant apartment cum office, and through various people we both knew, I got wind of this.  So he hired me as his little assistant.\n\nQ:  So how did this little assistant find a copy of the Diary of Anne Frank?\n\nJones:  Because Frank said one day that he was going off to lunch, and there was a pile of manuscripts to be returned. Among them there happened to be an advance copy of the French edition of The Diary of Anne Frank.  It hadn’t been published yet.  And he just said, “I’ve looked at them, there’s nothing worthwhile here.”\n\tSo I was sitting there, writing rejection letters, and then I picked up this book and it had her face on the cover.  I was just drawn to it, and I spent that whole afternoon until dark reading the book, and I was still there, just living that story when Frank walked in.  I just said firmly, “This has to go to New York.  They’ve got to publish it.”\n\tAnd he said, “What?”\n\nQ:  I was about to say, yeah, and?\n\nJones:  “The book by that kid?”  But, you have to understand the other side. First of all, not much was being talked about the Holocaust then.  It was still—\n\nQ:  Yes.  What year would this have been?\n\nJones:  It was just before ’51.  And that’s one factor.  And the other is an adolescent girl writing about this?  It’s so easy for editors to turn things down.  You have piles of stuff, I learned later that it got rejected by I don’t know how many—four or five—publishers in New York.  Whereas I had the good fortune to be sitting in that apartment.\n\nQ:  So you were reading it in French?\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  But they had sent copies; that is, the family or the European publishers had sent copies to New York to various publishers as well, or no?\n\nJones:  It had been shown in New York, yes.  And it may have been shown at the Frankfurt [Book] Fair?  No, I think that that came later.\n\nQ:  So how long was it between the time you read the book and that Doubleday released it in English, ballpark?\n\nJones:  Eight, nine months, probably ten months.\n\nQ:  Oh, very fast.\n\nJones:  Yes, ten months, probably.  Well, it had to be translated, too, so it may have been even longer than that.  But it was released before I came home.  So I must have seen it in ’50.\n\nQ:  Did you get credit for a kind of star turn?\n\nJones:  Not really.  Its impact grew.  I do remember that Otto Frank wanted to keep the dramatic rights, because, as he said, “I can’t bear to think of somebody playing my little Annie.”  Then, of course, you know what happened with—what was his name?  Meyer Levin?  Well, he was very manipulative, and talked Otto Frank into letting him take over the dramatic rights.  But I don’t suppose I really got particular credit, but that didn’t seem important.  I’m sure it’s why Blanche Knopf hired me later.\n\nQ:  Well, that’s really what I was wondering was, when you worked at Knopf, if it gave you a certain weight or something, that it made your recommendations look like sound recommendations when you made them.\n\nJones:  Yes, and she was looking for somebody.  She’d just fired an editor.  There was lots of that going on in those days.  It was very much like a squabbling family.  If you went against her wishes or Alfred’s, you were out. \n\nQ:  So when the manuscript for what would become Mastering the Art of French Cooking came in—well, first of all, could you describe what it physically looked like?\n\nJones:  Yes.  I had been at Knopf then for, let me see, probably a couple of years.  I was pretty much Blanche’s editor, because she had bought a number of French books after the war.\n\nQ:  You were editing them into English?\n\nJones:  I would be working with the translator, which, to me, it was fun. It was challenging to get good translations.  I had worked on just one little book on food that the Knopfs had acquired, but it didn’t really occur to me that this would be a part of a literary career.  There was still that separation, if you know what I mean. The “cookbook editor” was looked down on.\n\nQ:  Oh, absolutely.\n\nJones:  When I was at Doubleday, I remember Clara Classen, who did only cookbooks—dreary mostly made up of boxtop recipes from Pillsbury, that kind of thing.  So this manuscript was dumped on my desk simply because everybody knew I loved to cook and had lived in France, and they thought I’d be interested.\n\nQ:  So could you describe what it was that was dumped on your desk?\n\nJones:  Well, it was a huge manuscript.  I don’t know that I actually have the numbers, but I’d say it was at least seven hundred pages, by a Smith College girl and two French women nobody had ever heard of.  But I immersed myself in it, and I could see how very well thought out it was.  There was nothing like it, and it gave me exactly what I was saying earlier that I was missing and couldn’t find anywhere, and particularly when I came back from France and wanted to cook here.\n\nQ:  Meaning technique?\n\nJones:  The technique and also ingredients (there were so many things then that you just couldn’t get).  Nobody had ever heard of shallots.  There weren’t fresh mushrooms.  There weren’t any herbs.  Remember—you wouldn’t remember this, how garlic came in a nasty little box.\n\nQ:  Oh, it still does in some places.  [laughter]\n\nJones:  Those little desiccated heads.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJones:  The book told you what to do if you might not be able to get these ingredients, how to bring up other flavors.  It just seemed magical to me.  I was absolutely convinced that it was going to change the way America cooked.  I really felt that.  To me, what the men had said at Houghton Mifflin, that the American woman doesn’t want to know this much about French cooking, just seemed not true.  Suddenly for the first time even little secretaries were going abroad, and the G.I.’s had been in Europe and the Far East, and they came back with their taste buds awakened.  And I just felt that this was going to be—I don’t know.  You only measure something out of your conviction, don’t you?\n\nQ:  Yes.  I guess I—when did I look at it first?  I’m not sure.  I think probably I didn’t buy mine until something like 1965, something like that, so I missed the beginning.  In other words, by the time that I bought it, it had a buzz.  But it’s interesting to me that you had enough confidence in this manuscript as something that would make money for Knopf that you—\n\nJones:  Well, we weren’t as money-minded then, but I absolutely believed that it was something that would have an impact on cooking in this country.  Not that it was going to be a Fannie Farmer or a Joy of Cooking, but that if I felt this need and that it had been answered in this book, there must be millions like me.  I mean, I think you have to go on that instinct.\n\nQ:  Do you remember if the Elizabeth David books had been published?  Some of them must have been published in England by that point.\n\nJones:  Yes.  We actually published one Elizabeth David book, for which I was the designated editor. You can’t even say that I worked on it.  I just put it through.\n\nQ:  But this was prior to?\n\nJones:  No, this was after.  I’m pretty sure it was after.  I’ll have to check those dates.  But, you see, Elizabeth David didn’t do what Julia did.\n\nQ:  Technique, definitely not.\n\nJones:  She didn’t try to make us understand.  In fact, she was pretty darn careless.  I remember once writing to her that I tried a recipe and the filling was two or three times what you needed to fill whatever it was, I don’t remember, peppers or zucchini—and she just wrote back and said, “Oh, you Americans, you’re so exacting.  Just use the filling up in something else.”  Well, that’s hardly helpful to the novice—she was very high-handed.\n\nQ:  Yes.  I met her once.  Yes, she was.\n\tSo how long a period of time did you and the trio work on Mastering, or was that exclusively you and Julia?\n\nJones:  By then, Bertholle was pretty much out of the picture, and I didn’t really work directly with Simone Beck, known as Simca.  But I would ask things.  I remember once that I was trying to get them to do a cassoulet, because I just felt it was such a quintessentially French dish and also so marvelous, but I didn’t know what I was getting into.  I just opened up a can of worms, because only Simca knew what went into a true cassoulet and Julia, da, da, da, da.  There must have been a file about two inches thick devoted to that one recipe, with letters flying back and forth.  Simca would refer to me as Madame Jones in this, but I didn’t deal directly with her.\n\nQ:  Okay.  So going back to getting this big manuscript, and in your book you write that you tried the recipes right away.\n\nJones:  Oh yes, even before I recommended it for publication. The results were just miraculous.\n\nQ:  Do you remember which ones you tried first?\n\nJones:  Well, yes.  I know I tried the boeuf bourguignon and that’s when I became convinced. They explained the cuts of meat we should use and how to translate the French cuts to what you could get in the market here. Then the fact that you dry the meat, and if you use butter it’s going to burn. Also that you have to keep the pieces of meat separated so that they will brown, not steam. Nobody had ever put that kind of thing down, and it just made a world of difference.\n\nQ:  You cook with every cookbook writer that you’ve worked with, don’t you?  I mean, it seemed throughout the book [The Tenth Muse] that you always cooked their recipes.\n\nJones:  I do, because that’s the way you help the author to establish his or her voice, that you make it something special unto its own.\n\nQ:  Explain what you mean, though, about how cooking the recipes helped you help establish a writer’s voice.  I mean, how does that work?\n\nJones:  Well, if you’re cooking with them, you always learn useful tricks and you encourage the author to explain in her own words. I just did something from Madhur Jaffrey’s exciting new book on Indian cooking, made up of surprisingly easy recipes. Her ideas for simplifying are wonderful.  But I just made one dish last night, and you have all these wonderful seasonings that you rub into a piece of fish.  And then she has you brown the fish in quite hot fat.  Well, do you leave all that marinade on?  She doesn’t say.  So I did one with and one without.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nJones:  It’s just a small point, but I don’t think I’d have picked it up if I hadn’t tried it.   And then these spices, because they’re in pieces, they tend to blacken when you brown the meat if you’re going too fast.  So just in that one little recipe, I had about three questions, and if I don’t ask, I don’t think I’m being as helpful.\n\nQ:  Do you actually cook everything?\n\nJones:  Oh, no, no.\n\nQ:  No.  But just in general.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Let’s go back to Mastering, for a second.  It took a while to tame it, didn’t it, to wrestle it into publishable shape?\n\nJones:  It was miraculously well thought out by Julia.\n\nQ:  Really?  People describe her as so organized.\n\nJones:  Yes.  She had organized the book of having the ingredients of a recipe on the column to the left and to the right of the text, appearing as they are used. This, to me, was so intelligent, particularly because when the recipes are as long as they are in Mastering, you don’t want to be going back with your greasy fingers searching for the ingredients.  And that was all worked out.  No, it was an amazing manuscript.  Julia had spent years on it.  And also, she had learned to cook relatively late in life, so she knew all the questions to ask, and she was obsessive about getting it right, trying it out, comparing.\n\nQ:  So how long a period of time was it that you were working on the book?  I mean, “you” plural.\n\nJones:  I would say it was that last winter when they’re in Scandinavia.  I think it was about six months.\n\nQ:  That’s a lot of work for six months.\n\nJones:  It may have been longer.  I’d have to look at that whole file. But then, you know, the whole process of publishing a book, particularly a cookbook, now takes almost a year.\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, your colleagues at Knopf, how were they reacting to your spending your time this way?\n\nJones:  Well, I think Blanche resented it.  I think the only way I survived at Knopf was that I became a football between Alfred [Knopf] and Blanche.  [laughs]  And Alfred kind of took me under his wing.  He really appreciated my love of food, because he was, you know, a wine and food man, a member of various wine and food societies. He made a ritual of uncorking the wine at dinner. So I think he really was behind me.\n\nQ:  I want to talk about many of the other cookbooks, but I’m also curious to know at what point you began your fiction editing responsibilities, how you’ve woven both aspects of your career together.\n\nJones:  Well, I went there as a general editor and, as I say, it was very much of a family business, and they were very possessive about their authors so that they really liked it when they were the acquirers and you were assigned to work on the book.  And it was okay by me.  I mean, to me it was thrilling to be working on Elizabeth Bowen and Albert Camus, and who cared who brought it in? So I think I was in a very fortunate position in that sense, and then little by little, I acquired my own authors, once I had established their confidence in me.\n\nQ:  But were these two threads, your cookbook editing and your fiction editing, concurrent?\n\nJones:  Oh yes.  I think you acquire books on subjects you’re interested in. I edited some biography and what they used to called belles lettres in the old days.  I did quite a bit of poetry.  I was a general editor.\n\nQ:  Was the time you spent on being a general editor more or less equivalent to the time you spent on cookbooks?\n\nJones:  No.  There’s no question that a cookbook takes a great deal more hands-on attention, whereas with John Updike—I became his editor early on.\n\nQ:  He didn’t require the same amount of work.  [laughs]\n\nJones:  I knew right away I wasn’t going to tell Updike what to do.  So, part of editing is sheer diplomacy.\n\nQ:  How much time did that absorb, the second volume of Mastering?\n\nJones:  I was much more involved in that, in the planning and the choice of material--what was missing from the first volume.  By then Julia moved to Cambridge, and I’d go up and spend a couple of days working straight through the day, morning, noon, into the evening.\n\nQ:  So when you say you were more involved in the planning, what does that actually mean?\n\nJones:  Well, what we should have, what was missing or seemed too difficult in the first one.  It was my idea to have them do a French bread recipe, for instance, because, hard to believe, but at the time you could not get a good baguette.  It just didn’t exist in New York.  When I suggested that Julia work out a recipe, she assigned it to her husband, Paul, because she remembered that he used to bake bread. So she said, “Paul, you better the bread.  Play with it.”\n\tAnd he literally sent me two or three times a brown box filled with two or three of his baguettes, and you’d open them, and Evan and I would just laugh.  They looked like the gnarled limbs of an olive tree.  [laughter]  So pathetic.  And finally, when he gave up, Julia just said, “Well, we’re going to go to France. We’re going to meet the best French bread teacher, and we’ll take our flour and the salt and the yeast and everything we would use here.”\n\nQ:  The American flour?\n\nJones:  Yes, American flour.  To see what it was that was making such a difference.\n\nQ:  How long did it take to work on and then produce volume two?\n\nJones:  I bet we were working on it a couple of months, easily, easily, maybe more.\n\nQ:  Now, I took a look at—your wonderful assistant, Ken, provided me with lists of your cookbooks, because I asked if there was a list of anything in chronological order.  He said, “No, no.”  Both from this and from reading your book, I—let me just think for a second here.  I looked at Roy Andries de Groot, one of them.  Where would that be in here?  And Michael Field.  I guess I looked at Culinary Classics and Improvisations because I couldn’t find All Manner of Food, and I looked at Feasts for All Seasons.\n\nJones:  All Manner of Food was really a collection of his magazine pieces.\n\nQ:  I see.  Well, in any case, the books that I looked at, what interested me was that the way the recipes was presented was not the same as Mastering the Art of French Cooking, but that you seemed to have, I don’t know, learned something about the way to present recipes from that previous experience.  Now, maybe I was, you know, imposing that on you, but I wondered if you—\n\nJones:  Well, I think I just instinctively learned how important it is that the person who is that’s technically telling you what to do and explains the various techniques is right there in the kitchen with you.  But not everyone has a Julia Child voice—or should have.\n\nQ:  No.\n\nJones:  For instance, Claudia Roden’s recipes are much, much more succinct.  Technique is not that important, at least in Middle Eastern food.  There cooking is much more spontaneous, open to interpretation.  What’s important there was this sense that she had of connecting to the past through these recipes, and you get a wonderful feeling of the women of the household all getting together and gossiping and sending a little basket down onto the street to buy the goods and then pulling it up to their kitchen.. So that I have always encouraged that side of Claudia.  Actually, her first book was done when I acquired it.\nAnd the same with Madhur Jaffrey. And Irene Kuo. To me her book is the best book there is to help you on really learn about Chinese cooking. She would start thinking about why you velvet a piece of chicken as against slippe-- coating it, and the words just came out.  I mean, she did have a writer helping her, but the words came from her. The collaborator would watch Kuo cooking—that’s why the descriptions are so hands-on.  If she had just hired a writer and handed over some recipes, it wouldn’t have worked. \n\nQ:  I mean, each of those cases, they came from cultures where the food was an important part of the culture and where there was good home cooking where they came from.\n\nJones:  Exactly.\n\nQ:  So I wondered if you could talk about how important that is to a cookbook.\n\nJones:  It is, because food triggers memory, too.  I mean, even when I make a little dish for myself, I’ll remember it from childhood, and when I sit down and eat it, part of that pleasure is in the connecting, isn’t it?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJones:  It’s an emotional thing.  I’ve always encouraged that when that’s an important part of the story, and it almost invariably is.\n\nQ:  In a way, does it have to be that there’s a longstanding connection with the food of their cultures, of the authors’ cultures?\n\nJones:  Does it have to be?\n\nQ:  Yes, does it have to be a component, in your eyes, to end up with a good cookbook?\n\nJones:  I think it’s important. But what happened was that suddenly food was the big thing and everybody was writing on everything, even a book on zucchini. I think my measure has always been: does it make a contribution?  And I’m just not interested in one more book on zucchini or—\n\nQ:  Does it make a contribution and, presumably, the writing style is an element as well.\n\nJones:  Oh, very much so to me, yes. Lidia Bastianich is a good example. She had had a couple of cookbooks published before I took her on. Actually I had a chance at her first book, but I didn’t like her collaborator who imposed his own voice, who was writing with her.  He used to be the restaurant reviewer at Gourmet—an old boozer.  Do you remember him?\n\nQ:  Old boozers rarely make for good colleagues, but anyway.  [laughs]\n\nJones:  So I turned it down, but then some years later they—and she had a couple of books that were fine, her agent submitted her latest proposal to Knopf, and I welcomed the chance to work with her.  I said to her, “I want to come and watch you cook.  I’d love to get more of you on paper.”  And then just watching her, I’d ask questions, “Why are you doing this?  Why are you doing that?”  And she loved it, of course.  I mean, she said, “Judith released me.”  [laughs]  I’d sometimes get recipe headnotes from her, written at two in the morning when she’d done the rounds of her restaurants and driven back to Long Island. Then she’d be at her computer writing.  She’s just amazing.  Energy is a big asset.\n\nQ:  What about food memory?  Do most of these writers have a good food memory?\n\nJones:  Oh, I think so.  Yes, very definitely.\n\nQ:  Do you?  Or did you when you started all of this?\n\nJones:  I think so.  I have a very keen sense of association [that food kindles]—I mean, you could say “bread pudding” to me, and I can have a memory so sharp that it that it can almost bring tears.  But I can’t remember everything I ever ate, which Jim Beard could.\n\nQ:  Some people, yes.  Do you take notes at all about dishes you’ve had at restaurants or other people’s homes or memorable meals?\n\nJones:  I will sometimes if I’ve had something unusual—I remember the first time I had at the Four Seasons a dish of delicious brains, and Seppi [Renggli], who was the chef there, was a friend of Jim Beard’s, and Jim was on a diet.  [laughs]  So Seppi would cook for him and I would order something he particularly recommended of course. Jim’s fork would sneak over onto my plate, and we both agreed they were the most marvelous brains.  Seppi told us that he painted them first in mustard and then covered them with breadcrumbs.  That’s all he told us, so I went home and played with it, until it tasted almost as good as his. It’s now one of my favorite, wonderful dishes.  \n\nQ:  Do you find, though, that you need to take notes to remember things, or not necessarily?\n\nJones:  I’m not a big note-taker.  I used to take lots of notes when Evan had an assignment and we were traveling together, because he liked to get people to talk so he was free to give his full attention. You do need notes, or today it’s taping, to have a record of what was said.  So I do have lots of little notebooks of our trips.\n\nQ:  We can come back to some of these books, but why don’t we talk about how you met Jim Beard.\n\nJones:  Oh, oh, oh.  The first time I ever saw James Beard, I think it was—I still remember it was in a big basement room in the Lexington Avenue Hotel, and he was promoting Scotch Buckets.  [laughs]  I just liked him.  I mean, even though he seemed pretty hammy promoting those plaid buckets, he was obviously being paid to do it.  But the first time I talked to him was when Mastering the Art of French Cooking came out, and I just had the audacity to call people and say, “This book is remarkable. Do take a look at it.” And you have to remember that there weren’t many remarkable cookbooks then.\nHe was open to talking to anyone who called and he said, “Send it down to me.”  When he’d read the proofs, he phoned and said that he thought it was a masterpiece, and then he said, “We’ve got to introduce these people to the food community.  We’ll have to give a party.”  And he immediately flew into action.  Then he said sheepishly, sort of at the end of this conversation, he said, “I wish I’d written it.”  [laughs]  \n\nQ:  Then he did give a party, yes?\n\nJones:  Yes.  He got Dione Lucas to give a party at her restaurant, the Bread Basket, and she was slightly drunk and very coquettish.\n\nQ:  What kinds of people were invited?\n\nJones:  Well, you know, the food community was a handful of people.\n\nQ:  At that point.\n\nJones:  Clementine Paddleford.  Helen McCully, Craig Claiborne.\n\nQ:  Yes.  Not the kind of huge things that today’s books—\n\nJones:  Oh no.  \n\nQ:  Then how did your relationship with Beard, such as it was, develop?\n\nJones:  Well, we became friends, obviously.  I’d often ask him for advice, even before we had become friends—I had forgotten this—I sensed that there was a whole new wave in the sixties, the counterculture, who were all making their own bread. It was the big thing, and I felt there was a need for a good bread book, that a mastering the art of bread. So I called up Jim Beard and I asked him to have lunch with me.  I took him to quite a posh place and brought up the subject.  He said, “That’s a good idea.  You’re absolutely right.  I’ll think about it.”\n\nQ:  You told him that you were thinking of having such a book done as opposed to—\n\nJones:  Yes.  And I was asking him who would be the right person to do it, because he knew the food world much better than I did. So he said, “I’ll think about it.”\n\tA few months went by, and I said, “Have you thought?”\n\tAnd he said, “Well, let’s have lunch together again.”  So we had about four of these posh lunches.  [laughs]  At the end of it, he said, “I thought about it.  I’m almost through with my American Food.  I want to do that book.  I’m the person to do it.”\n\tSo I said, “Great.”\n\nQ:  Had that gotten to be your intention?\n\nJones:  No, it really hadn’t.  In fact, I wasn’t even that sure that he had that kind of analytical mind that I wanted for this, I mean, really dealing with all the basics.  But it turned out he was just wonderful.  I remember we did a basic recipe, and I got about six people around Knopf who’d never baked a loaf of bread before to follow the recipe and they all brought in the results.  You can’t imagine how different they were.  [laughs]  And took the loaves down to Jim, and he cut them open and examined each.  Then he wrote a section—it runs about a page and a half—entitled Remedies For the Not Quite Perfect Slice—point by point, analyzing what might have gone wrong if the slice sags or is damp or has baked unevenly. His analyses are not only extraordinarily useful, but reflect his whole gentle, encouraging personality—he’s never cross with you, he never makes you feel like an idiot.\n\nQ:  You mean the recipe does reflect that? \n\nJones:  He gives a recipe, and then he says that if this goes wrong, if that goes wrong, how to correct it.\n\nQ:  I see.\n\nJones:  And this all came out of what went wrong when those people at Knopf made exactly the same recipe.  Well, you’ve made bread.  You know that it’s never exactly the same way twice.\n\nQ:  Never.  Who was helping him with that book?\n\nJones:  I think it was José Wilson. I got to know her very well, and saw how she dealt with his restlessness.  I’d send him a book, and he’d have read it by the next day.  I’d go down to his house on West 12th Street with my list of things that we were going to be doing that morning, and after about the fourth item, he’d begin to get restless.  If the phone rang, he could hardly stand it and he’d stop listening to me.  Then he’d pick up the phone and he’d say, “Yes?  Uh-huh.  Abigail from Kansas City.  Now, tell me, dear, what happened when the oven blew up?” or something.  [laughs]  He loved it.\n\nQ:  Now, you worked on him, according to these lists, on these books.  I wasn’t sure what you had done.  I mean, there’s Beard on Bread, Beard on Pasta, The New James Beard.  I wasn’t sure what you had done with Theory and Practice of Good Cooking.\n\nJones:  What I’d done with it?\n\nQ:  I mean, in other words, were you in on that from the beginning?\n\nJones:  Oh yes.  We kind of cooked up together.\n\nQ:  Oh, tell me about that.  That’s very interesting, then, because when I looked it up, I couldn’t find much written about how that came about.\n\nJones:  Well, I realized what a good analytical mind he had and what a lot of knowledge he’d accumulated, and I just thought he could explore the theories of cooking and how we practiced them. I wanted a book that was American oriented.  I mean, it’s not French, it’s not Italian, it’s not any one thing.  So it is organized through techniques, such as boiling, braising, dry heat, frying, sautéing, and so on—\n\nQ:  So it was your organization?\n\nJones:  Yes, pretty much. Jim and I really cooked it up together, but it was my concept, and he liked the idea.  And at that point he was also doing those monthly pieces for—what airline was it?  Was it American Airlines?\n\nQ:  There were so many of them.  I don’t have that list with me.\n\nJones:  And he was writing about this kind of thing, so it helped.  It gave him ideas for the book.\n\nQ:  So how long did it take to massage a spine for it into shape?\n\nJones:  Oh, I bet we worked on that well over a year, and José would be there to do the final writing. But she wasn’t always there when I went down to his kitchen and we would get carried away talking, so it helped to have her around.\n\nQ:  She could write it down.  [laughs]\n\nJones:  Yes, she could write it down.\n\nQ:  When you went down there, were you talking, cooking?  What were you both doing?\n\nJones:  Yes, we would be working on the book, but Jim loved to talk too.  He would love to tell you about the opera the night before, a little gossip, and the book he’d read when he’d come home.  [laughs]  He was a like a naughty boy sometimes.  He hated to be pinned down too much. I’d have to say, “Jim, let’s go back to braising.”\n\nQ:  Now, at that point in the publishing industry, could you more or less spend whatever time on these books that you wanted?\n\nJones:  Yes.  Nobody ever questioned.  And quite a lot of it out of the office.\n\nQ:  And would that be the same today?\n\nJones:  Today?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJones:  I think so, yes.  You’re pretty much responsible for how you use your time.  And, my god, I used to work hard in those days, because I’d be reading manuscripts most of the night.  My family can still remember my being up at one in the morning finishing a book that Blanche wanted me to read immediately.\n\nQ:  I know we’ve mentioned this, but at the time you were working on this Theory and Practice, you would have been doing whatever other fiction work or other belles lettres work at the same time?\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  It’s a lot to balance.\n\nJones:  Yes, probably. I don’t remember, I had so many books one year.  I think I had something like nineteen books I was editing.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nJones:  Yes.  Because I’d get assigned things, as well as the things that I was doing.  [unclear], fortunately.\n\nQ:  Fortunately?\n\nJones:  Well, I’m withdrawing.  I mean, I haven’t bought new things for a year or so.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJones – 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Judith Jones\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Session #2\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\tNew York City, New York\n\nDate:  May 7, 2009\n\n \n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It’s May 7, and I’m with Judith Jones in her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan for our second interview.  Good afternoon.\n\nJones:  Hello.\n\nQ:  One of the things we didn’t talk about the other day was the Knopf Cooks American Series, and I’d love to know how and when that came about.  I couldn’t tell whether all the books were signed at the same time or how that worked and then what happened.\n\nJones:  Okay.  It’s a sad story.  That was an ambitious project, and it really came about because my husband, Evan, had done a book on American Food: The Gastronomic Story,  and it really was a book that was kind of ahead of its time.  Nobody had looked at what makes American food so unique, because we are a country of so many different waves of immigration that influenced the way we eat and are always open to new things, that it’s a hard subject to get your hands around.  And while there had been books about Pennsylvania Dutch cooking and Mormon cooking and so on, they were more little church social books and amateur efforts, and nobody had looked at the big picture.\n\nQ:  When was this, ballpark?\n\nJones:  I can look up dates, but I think that his book was late sixties. \n\nQ:  All right.  I’ll check that date. [It was published in 1975.] And then about how much later did you start thinking about the series?\n\nJones:  Well, I started thinking about it as he was, doing the American book, because there was so much to write about, particularly [unclear] what was happening today, My idea was to publish a series of books, not just regionally oriented, but to take a subject as often as we could as the focus. One of the topics we took was sausages, for instance, written by Bruce Aidells, who was a wonderful sausage maker out in California.  It’s a fascinating book.\n\nQ:  Here they are.  So they start here and then go there.\n[List of titles is shown to Jones]\n\nQ:  Okay, go ahead.  Oh, I see, it is in sequence.  The American series as they’re put together here is in sequence.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Sorry about that.  The electronic age.\n\nJones:  Yes, between this and my glasses.\n\nQ:  And then the phone and then—  [laughter]  And then it goes over to the next page.\n\nJones:  Knopf  Cooks American, yes.  For instance, after sausages. We did the story of beer in this country, and then a different kind of take on, say, Italian food because of there wasn’t just one kind of Italian food. A group of Italian immigrants settled, they brought with them northern Italian or southern Italian, and so on.  Nancy Verde Barr contributed a wonderful book called We Called it Macaroni.  And Joan Nathan on Jewish cooking in America, two Minnesotans looking at the northern heartland altogether, and Ken Thom on the food he grew up on. Also a Chinese American book, Latin American book and so on.\n\nQ:  Were these assigned all at once, at one go?\n\nJones:  No, no.  I started with two authors and two books.  And Knopf was a wonderful place to work, because they were open to—it was still a small house then—open to this kind of experiment. And it was an experiment, because what we really wanted to have happen was that bookstores would take the whole series, devote a shelf to them, adding the latest title as it came along, accompanied by a little shelf talker describing the series.\n\nQ:  And about how big were they?\n\nJones:  They were quite good-sized, wonderfully illustrated with documentary illustrations.  This was before everything had to be in full-color photographs, but they were very intriguingly designed.  I mean, you’d pick them up and there was color, but just not color photographs.  I think what happened really was that we couldn’t get the bookstores to support the idea because it’s a here today, gone tomorrow approach to selling books.  I mean, that’s very much the thinking of the big chains today.\n\nQ:  You mean in a bookstore.\n\nJones:  And I was still thinking—\n\nQ:  They’re not thinking shelf life.\n\nJones:  So it didn’t happen that way we hoped—the books got good reviews, but unless you sell a certain number of copies a year, they weren’t kept in stock. Storage was much more expensive.  There was tax on storage and so on and so forth.  That’s one of the real frustrations.\n\nQ:  There’s tax on storage?  Oh, interesting.\n\nJones:  It’s considered an asset, but particularly for small publishers, that makes it hard to keep books in print. Whereas when I first went into publishing, the books that sustained places like Knopf were the backlist.  You could count on them selling year after year after year.  So our American series was an experiment, and I certainly found some extremely good authors, but we couldn’t go on with it.\n\nQ:  About how long a period of time would those have been done?\n\nJones:  I probably should have looked up all these figures, but I think you have some dates here. It was about ten years, nine years.\n\nQ:  This is partly what I was wondering.  I should have looked this up myself, too, but I was trying to remember when the Time-Life, first of all, The Foods of the World series came out, and then they did do it geographically.\n[Series started in 1968.]\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  But, of course, that was marketed by mail, so it wasn’t bookstore competition, but it was, I think, out there around the same time.  I’m not sure.  So you were in some ways both thinking along the same lines.\n\nJones:  Yes.  I think that the Time-Life did the European series.\n\nQ:  Yes, that’s correct.\n\nJones:  Yes.  And then—\n\nQ:  Then the American.\n\nJones:  That series irritated me, because particularly when they did the European series, they wanted recipes from famous authors like Julia Child and James Beard and so on and so forth.\n\nQ:  You mean free?\n\nJones:  Well, they paid a pittance, and why should you put all those authors together in one book when we’re selling them very well separately?  It’s a dangerous game.  So we resisted it, I resisted it, and I remember they were so furious.  They called the president of Random House, saying, “Who is this woman who’s blocking our—?”  And also, let’s face it, the recipes—and text—are written by committee even though the author is credited.  I mean, they got somebody like M.F.K. Fisher to do the book on French cookery, and there wasn’t anything of her left in what came out.  So I didn’t feel that series was really competition, but nevertheless, ours didn’t work.\n\nQ:  But the Time-Life books were promoted heavily.  That’s the one thing I was thinking about.\n\nJones:  Very heavily, yes.\n\nQ:  So you presumably—you, Knopf—put a certain amount of money into the American series.\n\nJones:  And some sold for a long time.  The Brooklyn Cookbook did very well.  You know the Brooklyn people are such chauvinists.\n\nQ:  Do you remember what was in The Brooklyn Cookbook?\n\nJones:  It was called The Brooklyn Cookbook.\n\nQ:  Let me look at the list, too.\n\nJones:  And it was a particularly good book.  There were good stories.\n\nQ:  And the stories were attached to the recipes?\n\nJones:  They all have recipes, yes, and they told the story through the food, yes, and the way it evolved.  There were some that were regional, titles such The Florida Cookbook. But I really liked the idea of following the story through a subtext.\n\nQ:  And sausage.  Did you stop assigning them or just give up trying to persuade bookstores to keep them, or how did it get put to rest, the series?\n\nJones:  Well, you just don’t reprint.\n\nQ:  I see.\n\nJones:  And they die a slow death.\n\nQ:  That is a sad story.  [laughter]\n\nJones:  It is a sad story.  That is one of the really good things, I think, about using the internet, because we can get books on demand now, and I think more and more, instead of books going out of print and the years of work that went into it just lost. Now you can go to a machine and put a few dollars in, and out comes the book.\n\nQ:  It’s incredible.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  At The New School panel recently, a couple months back, it was a James Beard panel, you said that you remembered Jim Beard saying, “We’re American and we can do as we please.”\n\nJones:  “Do as we please.”  I love that.  \n\nQ:  So in the light of this, well, we’re talking about American books, could you play out what you think that meant to him and what that meant about him?\n\nJones:  Yes.  Well, one is that it was his nature not to be rigid, and he was just so encouraging and loving, and appreciative that it didn’t matter if you failed.  That was his whole stance as a teacher.  He was wonderful that way.  But he also felt that American food was this huge conglomerate of different cuisines, and you might do it one way in Louisiana and another way in Milwaukee, which was very much the theme that I was playing with here. That approach makes cookery enriching whereas rigidities tend to make you not experiment, to just be rooted in the past, and that was not his way.  He always had a new way of doing something.\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nJones:  Well, I mean he was always open to whatever was the latest equipment.  So was Julia, too, but Jim particularly.  For instance, I remember when we did the bread book with him, and I went down sometimes to his house in Greenwich Village to help him, watch him, and take notes. Once he had the broiler on instead of the oven on, and he put the beautiful loaf he had just shaped under the broiler.  And when we went to check it, it was mighty brown on top.  But he said, “Hey, we’re going to have broiled bread,” and he turned the oven down so that the bottom caught up with the top, maybe put a little foil over the top, and, sure enough, we had a recipe for broiled bread.\n\nQ:  That is very inventive.  Talking about the bread book, a number of people have said to me that they felt that you made him as an author; in other words that you, I guess—well, I’m curious to know what you think, but the idea was that the books that he did with you were rather different from the books that preceded.\n\nJones:  Yes, and I definitely encouraged him. We started by doing a bread book because it was during that counterrevolution of the sixties when all the yuppies were—\n\nQ:  Making bread.\n\nJones:  No, the hippies.  The yuppies came later.  Excuse me.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJones:  …were making their own bread and even making their own yeast out of grape skins, and that kind of things, and yet there really wasn’t a good teaching book on bread.  So I called Jim Beard and—did I tell you this about how we had lunch?\n\nQ:  Yes, that we did talk about, yes.\n\nJones:  So we have the three or four lunches together, and finally he said, “I’m the man to do the bread book.” I was delighted.  This book made him analyze why he did something, how he did it, and to express it.  And, to me, that is the most important thing in a cookbook, the voice, the authority that can sort of deconstruct and then make you able to do it all alone in your own kitchen for the first time with nobody there except the voice of the author.  And he liked that.\n\tJim, he started out as an actor, and though he was never good on television because he was always self-consciously acting, he had that acting ability in him.  So I think that that started him writing much more openly and not just submitting to the terrible little short formula that was—\n\nQ:  Did you encourage him to do an outline or to think of it as a teaching book?\n\nJones:  I think that’s why I spent a lot of time with him.  I ask lots of questions, and then I’d say, “Get that in, get that in.  Why did my loaf rise so that the top sprung away from the bottom, and why had someone else’s hardly rose at all?”  There are so many variables.  That’s something that anybody who loves cooking begins to understands, and work with, making the act of cooking it, a positive rather than something to be scared of.\n\nQ:  Did he give you an outline before he actually started writing, or you created one together?\n\nJones:  We worked out an outline, yes, and he always had a writer, because he did more than was humanly possible for one man to do.  So José Wilson was his collaborator that I worked with mostly, and I was there as the devil’s advocate to get them to really explain.\n\nQ:  By this time, you had, of course, considerable experience with, as it were, teaching cookbooks.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So I suppose what I’m asking you is, did you see it that way as well, that you felt there was the need for something that explained how to do things?\n\nJones:  I realized the importance, that you couldn’t just simply write formulas, but you had to explain, and that that made all the difference in the world.  I think Julia Child revolutionized the way cookbooks could be written.  I’m afraid they’re not always written that way today.\n\nQ:  Well, it takes a lot of space, so that’s part of it, too.\n\tAt The New School [panel], too, you also said you thought that book opened him up a little bit.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Could you explain how?\n\nJones:  Well, I think he liked the concept, and it’s certainly what he did instinctively as a teacher, so he was able to translate that to the page, and it empowered him to really connect with that lone person in the kitchen.\n\nQ:  Did you go to any of his classes?\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So you had an experience of him in a different way than just personally?\n\nJones:  Yes.  Yes, that helped a lot.\n\nQ:  Were the classes very organized, or how did that work?\n\nJones:  No, not particularly.  [laughter]  Jim was not the most organized person, and, to me, it was also interesting to watch people. I could almost tell which ones really were going to get it.  I could pick out the ones who really enjoyed eating as against the sort that   Julia used to call the Nervous Nellies, who always needed one more rule to follow.\n\tThe tough thing about cookbooks is that you’re writing for the rank beginner and the experienced, even the chef, and how you put it all together to figure it out for each author is challenging. You don’t want them all to have the same voice.\n\nQ:  Was he a good teacher, from that point of view?\n\nJones:  A wonderful teacher, yes, because he was very empowering and very encouraging, and people had fun.\n\nQ:  Yes, that’s very important.\n\nJones:  I mean, as compared to somebody like Marcella Hazan, who practically rapped you over the knuckles if you asked a word and if you dared touch the dough.  Each one is a very different personality.\n\nQ:  What about the pasta book?  Did that precede—\n\nJones:  That came out after the bread.\n\nQ:  Yes, I haven’t seen it.  I wasn’t able to get a copy of that, so I didn’t get a look at it.  Was it in the same form as the bread book or how was it organized?\n\nJones:  Exactly the same form.  It was a companion to it, and it was based on the same theory, that all of a sudden the world of Italian cooking had opened up, and Marcella [Hazan] is much responsible for that, that Italian food wasn’t just southern Italian food, tomato sauce and garlic, but all kinds of regional nuances, and everybody was making pasta.  There were pasta shops all over New York.  It was quite amazing.  So I thought there should be a good book on pasta from an American authority who could borrow from anywhere.\n\nQ:  So the recipes were from all over the place?\n\nJones:  Yes.  But pasta is pasta.  I mean he didn’t get into dumplings and things like that, but certainly regional differences improvising out of American ingredients.  I remember once I was at his house working with him, and he was so excited because he’d had such a good pasta the night before at some little Italian place, and it was made with swordfish and black olives.  I make it quite often, just to remember Jim.  You see, that, to me, is another thing that delights me about food, is that it isn’t just a dish and eating and enjoying it.  That’s fine.  But it’s so filled with memory and associations, so that you have a dish like that and you suddenly are with that person.  And I don’t know that Americans quite open themselves up to that as readily as some cultures.\n\nQ:  Open themselves up to?\n\nJones:  To that delight in food and those associations. Spending time with food and all sitting at the table together and drinking wine and—\n\nQ:  It gets harder.\n\nJones:  We’re more rigid.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJones:  Some Americans.  Also, in looking at the American story, it was interesting how the Puritan influence prevailed for so long, except in the South. And then the whole development of the food industry with their prepared foods had a tremendous influence, because they played on women’s image of themselves, saying, “You don’t want to get your hands all smelly with garlic, little woman,” and it’s sort of demeaning to cook.  That’s for—\n\nQ:  Yet at the same time—well, maybe it wasn’t the same time, I guess it was the sixties into the seventies, people were buying these new cookbooks and these teaching cookbooks.\n\nJones:  Well, that’s after the explosion, after Julia.\n\nQ:  Yes, I see.  I see.  So we’re talking about the fifties.\n\nJones:  And I think there was a tremendous change after the war.  Julia often said to me, [imitating Child’s voice], “Judith, you and I were there at the right time.”  [laughter]\n\nQ:  She was right.\n\nJones:  She certainly was at the right time.  But America was ready for her, because we were traveling, and not just the elite traveling, but every little secretary went to Europe for the first time, and the G.I.’s came home from Europe and the Far East, and so it was a very yeasty time.\n\nQ:  I guess by the late—well, by the sixties, when I was first aware of it, Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s, they had the equipment that it would have been really hard to get at other times.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Whether they were specific sizes of soufflé dishes or tamis or whatever.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So that is interesting.  Okay, now, talking about teaching cookbooks.  This, however, brings us to this, which indeed I did—\n\nJones:  What is that?\n\nQ:  —get from the internet.  I mean, I was able to get hold of that.  This is James Beard’s Theory & Practice of Good Cooking, and you did say the other day that you took an active role in this.  So tell me about that.  Tell me about its genesis, whether you babysat it the whole time.  How did that work?  I just thought maybe looking at it might—\n\nJones:  Well, by then Jim was writing also a syndicated column, and he was writing for one of the southern airlines, so he was turning out a lot of material, and it seemed to me that the thinking in these pieces represented what I feel about food, that you really have to understand the theory, not just of what braising is, but all that’s connected with it, how you do it properly, why.  And, you know, once you understand that, you hardly need recipes.  The rest is just themes and variations.\n\nQ:  But you do need good explanations.\n\nJones:  You need wonderful explanations.  That’s what I thought Jim was very good at.\n\nQ:  So that he talks first about tools, with illustrations.  Let’s see what we have here.  And basics like chicken stock, veal stock, even, and methods, which is interesting.  Now, how did the two of you work together to develop the order of this book?\n\nJones:  I don’t remember the details.  It just sort of evolved out of talking and pressing him with questions.\n\nQ:  I was going to say, again, you must have asked him questions.\n\nJones:  Yes.  And then because he was writing these regular columns, he played a lot with the material in this book and tried it on people.\n\nQ:  I mean, there are things here that it probably would be hard to find.  Thickeners and liaisons, not a lot of cookbooks include a section on that now.\n\nJones:  No, they don’t.\n\nQ:  Or chilling and freezing.  We do need guidance, so some of that must have been you.\n\nJones:  I certainly was there pushing and asking questions, yes.\n\nQ:  Then the concordance of terms and ingredients.\n\nJones:  Yes. Terms are important, or the way you use language.  This is something I feel so strongly about, that you don’t just say “in a bowl combine the first mixture with the second mixture,”—and that’s what recipe have become in magazines—because, one, it’s bad English.  You don’t “in a bowl” do something, but no one cares about that.\n\nQ:  There you are standing in a bowl, yes.  [laughter]\n\nJones:  But what does combine mean?  Somebody who’s really telling you about theory and practice would tell you why you’re folding at this point, or why you shouldn’t whisk the eggs too much when you’re making an omelet, what that will do to the eggs. So you don’t use a word like “combine.” You use “whisk” or “mix with your hands” or “scrunch through.”  Julia’s language is so visceral, and I think that that is really part of theory and practice, understanding terms. Instead of talking about a mixture, you talk about the batter once it’s become a batter, so the person reading this book learns to understand culinary terms.  And that’s just gone out the window, and I don’t understand why.  I think it was to shorten recipes used in newspapers and magazines.\n\nQ:  Yes, that’s what I was thinking, to save space.  How long did it take to write this?  Was it a long time aborning?\n\nJones:  Well, Jim always needed prodding, but he worked very hard.  I would say that was—\n\nQ:  This is a lot of work.\n\nJones:  —probably three years.\n\nQ:  And did Knopf promote it?\n\nJones:  Yes, yes.\n\nQ:  So, how well did it do?\n\nJones:  It didn’t do exactly what I hoped it would do, because I think maybe it seemed a little esoteric to people.  But it was a backlist item for years and years.  We no longer have it in print now, but it was a good solid backlist book over the years.  I would guess that book did about—and it’s a guess—80,000 copies, 75,000 copies.  But it was never big, big.\n\nQ:  But it seems like it must have been the only thing around at that time that went into this.  I don’t know when Jacques Pépin—\n\nJones:  Techniques and—his first books were really just a little bit too esoteric for Americans.\n\nQ:  I was going to say they were really for professionals, essentially.\n\nJones:  They were for professionals, yes, and then he started to work more with home cooking. It was wonderful to see Julia and Jacques working together—did we talk about that?\n\nQ:  No.  No, I actually, at the time of the book, I talked to you for the newspaper about that.\n\nJones:  Yes.  But it was just great to see them, because here they were, both schooled in French technique, and that is the backbone of western cooking—no two ways about it— and yet their approach was different. Julia was the one that was far more rigid, and Jacques was this kind of anything goes and trying everything.  He’d become so American except for his accent. He’d still say, “But that’s not the point [French pronunciation].  That’s not the point, Julia.”  [laughter]  But it also told you that nothing is written in stone, that you have two really great artists and they do things slightly differently, and it’s part of their trademark on that particular dish.\n\nQ:  It’s a wonderful book, and not only because of the recipes, but because it shows a little of their relationship.\n\nJones:  It does.\n\nQ:  And it shows the point you’ve just made, and it’s fun.  It’s a lovely book.\nNow, you know that part of the reason for this project is to gather some information from people who knew James Beard, but it is also talking to people who we believe really have changed the way people think about food.  And because of these books that you’ve edited, you obviously are one of these people.  And when we talked the last time, you said that your standard for whether or not to accept a book or to go ahead with it was whether or not it made a contribution.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  I wondered if you could in context say what that meant.\n\nJones:  Well, I think that there are an awful lot of books that are churned out in any field, and when this explosion of interest in cooking in America took place, everybody was on the bandwagon.  My example is the zucchini cookbook.  Who the hell needs a zucchini cookbook?  And it seemed to me that more and more the important thing to look for was that teacher, that guide who really led you into new territory and enabled you to take on the mantle yourself and learn to love it, experiment, and create your own style (or not real style of cooking, but your own way of cooking).  And so I guess that’s my criterion.\n\nQ:  I reason I made this timeline—where did it go?—was to see how those books progressed.  The references I have are more or less the first time you worked with somebody.  But as you know, in the beginning it’s not, but then it does kind of go through different sorts of cuisines, and I’m curious to know whether that was conscious.\n\nJones:  That was very conscious.  I felt that if Julia could do this for French cooking, I must find somebody who could do it for Middle Eastern cooking.  That was just beginning to open up.  And Chinese cooking.  Not that there’s one Chinese cuisine, but the basics of Chinese cooking.  And I also felt that what we wanted there was somebody who was the voice for that, a voice that’s full of memory, and this very often came from somebody, particularly women, who’d left their past. Food was a way of reconnecting.\n\nQ:  Their geographical past?\n\nJones:  Their geographical past. Claudia Roden and her Jewish family had to leave Egypt, Irene Kuo, who did the Chinese book, had had to leave, and she grew up, as did Claudia, in a household where there were servants.  So they enjoyed the food and they had all those memories, but they didn’t necessarily know how to cook.  So in teaching themselves, they were teaching others, they’re teaching you.  Madhur Jaffrey is a wonderful example of that, too.  So there was a conscious effort on my part to look for really good books of this kind.\n\nQ:  Madhur Jaffrey also did not grow up cooking.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  I believe she also had to check in with her family or the family cook to see how things were done.\n\nJones:  Yes.  And then that kind of person is more sympathetic sometimes than a chef to the little fledgling home cook all alone in the kitchen saying, “Help,” because that person was once there, too.\n\nQ:  So are they more likely to think through the steps that a newcomer would need to know?\n\nJones:  Yes, and to explain, not take for granted that you know all these culinary words.\n\nQ:  Now, these books in some way or other mirror the explosion of interest in these different subjects, but some of them, to me, seemed almost a little ahead of their time or perhaps they were the first big books to be able to explain these cuisines.  I don’t know whether you felt you were leading the way, whether you felt these were necessary, whether you were riding a wave.\n\nJones:  You know, I don’t think you ever really feel you’re leading the way.  I really had to listen to my own instinct. That’s certainly what I did with Julia Child.  It wasn’t anything more than if this book means so much to me, there must be others like me.  If I feel the need of a book that will really tell me about Middle Eastern cooking and all the nuances, there must be others like me, and there were.  It’s just they had been repressed, and once we were releasing them, they sprouted up all over the country.\n\nQ:  Now, meanwhile, you were trying out recipes from each of these.  So you and Evan, your own dinners must have changed in many ways or at least had more of a variety of cooking than you started out, yes?\n\nJones:  Yes. \n\nQ:  Was he enthusiastic about that?\n\nJones:  Oh, he was, and he was also—I think men are more apt to be this way.  He was much more of an experimenter, unafraid.  He’d look at two or three recipes and put them aside and the make it his way.  He’d learn from each. If I was out of coconut, for instance, he’d say, “So I’ll try something that has a little sweetness,” and he would improvise. \n\nQ:  Now, presumably, also your kitchen grew in spices, ingredients, even elements of the foreign cuisine, you would need different things to make some of these.\n\nJones:  Yes.  I think that’s one of the hardest things to organize.  I mean, you really should have in your kitchen a little Indian section and a Chinese section, and there isn’t room for it. Also you have to buy too much, and spices go stale.  It’s hard to throw things out, isn’t it?\n\nQ:  It is, but you have to force yourself.  It is very hard to do it.  Certainly you would have needed certain different spicing for Middle Eastern cooking.  Italian cooking, I mean, nobody had those little paddles for making gnocchi or—\n\nJones:  Oh, no.\n\nQ:  So you must have been introducing yourself to the various things that are required.  I don’t know what it would have been in Latin America.\n\nJones:  Well, just the food processor, for instance, what you’re able to do is amazing.  You can make pasta dough, you can make bread dough, you can make gnocchi, you can do those French things like quenelles that you used to have to put through a sieve.\n\nQ:  I’m trying to remember when the food processors—it started being marketed in the late sixties?\n\nJones:  The food processor?\n\nQ:  The Cuisinart.\n\nJones:  The Cuisinart, yes.  It was a little later.  Late sixties, I think.\n\nQ:  As we just spoke before, meanwhile, you were still also doing literature and poetry and other things at this same time.  Why In the Kitchen with Rosie?\n\nJones:  Well, that’s a story unto itself.\n\nQ:  How much of that can you share?\n\nJones:  Since this isn’t going to be published material, I think that I can tell you that I was selected to go to Chicago.  Oprah [Winfrey] had been doing a memoir of her life, and a lot had gone into it; she then withdrew it for reasons of—\n\nQ:  The memoir?\n\nJones:  Yes.  And I think she’s a very decent person.  I think she felt bad about it.\n\nQ:  Was she doing it with you, with Knopf?\n\nJones:  Yes.  Not with me personally, no, no.  With Knopf.\n\nQ:  Yes, “you” plural, yes.\n\nJones:  Yes.  So when she had this idea that she would put her cook, Rosie, on the show, she thought, “We’ll do a quick little book and Knopf can publish it.”  This is my interpretation of it, that she was trying to make up for having really let us down.  So I was summoned by our CEO and asked to go out to Chicago and find somebody who could work with Rosie and go out to Oprah’s ranch and make the book happen in two weeks.\n\n[Next few comments deleted by Jones]\n\nShortly after we arrived, Oprah blew in.  She’d been running, and she had that running high, all sweaty and smiley. And she listened to what I was saying about the book and how it should be, and then she looked at me and she said, “Do you think we’re doing this too fast?”\n\tAnd I had been told, “Don’t say no to anything.”  [laughs]  So I answered, “Well, we can do anything, but, yes, it won’t be as good a book.”\n\tShe quickly responded that then she would postpone having Rosie on the show. So we were given something like three months’ grace to write the book   I mean, Rosie’d never written a book before.  So I really admired her immediately.  \n\n[Next few comments deleted by Jones]\n\nJones:  The rest is history. That book [In the Kitchen With Rosie] sold more than any cookbook ever. It was a huge success.  \n\nQ:  But then later on, you did—\n\nJones:  Then we did one with—\n\nQ:  With Andy Weil.\n\nJones: Rosie and Andy Weil.  Well, Andy Weil was a Knopf author.\n\nQ:  I see.\n\nJones:  So that’s how that happened.\n\nQ:  I see.  It wasn’t a natural marriage.  I remember interviewing both of them at the time.\n\nJones:  You got that.  He was so condescending to her, it made me furious.  And I had to drink his green powdered tea.\n\nQ:  Green stuff.  [laughs]\n\nJones:  Lukewarm.  I think if anything could make you nauseated, that does.\n\nQ:  So that’s how it prevented you from eating very much.\n\nJones:  But Rosie, she was just a gem to work with.  She’s so nice, and she got it.\n\nQ:  I don’t remember the title of that, but when you did the book with Andy Weil, presumably, but you tell me, there was a desire stirring for healthful recipes?\n\nJones:  Oh yes.  It was very much the new vogue.  I’d never wanted to do a diet book, but I did succumb to the one by Ed Giobbi, because I knew he was a wonderful Italian cook, and I was sort of fascinated by how you could take Italian cooking and make it so healthful.  This was when the safflower was the cure-all for everything.\n\nQ:  So this is in 1998, Eat Right, Eat Well, the Italian Way, that’s what your—\n\nJones:  Yes.  And I remember Julia said, “Safflower oil?”  She said, “I had these kooks in my kitchen one time, they were staying in the house, and they used safflower oil, and it was in everything.  You couldn’t get it out of the—it clogged up the stove.  If it does that with a stove, what does it do to your arteries?”  She was so damned right, you know, of all the idiot things.  So that book was not a wild success, but it was the beginning of a wonderful relationship with Ed Giobbi, so I don’t regret it.\n\nQ:  Then The Healthy Kitchen, the one with Rosie Daley and Andy Weil was 2003, so presumably the desire for guidance to healthful but good eating had grown at that point?\n\nJones:  Yes.  Oh, you know that whole wave of the fear of fat that was—\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJones:  —incredible.\n\nQ:  Weil’s books, I guess, do so well in general.  I don’t know whether this combo did.\n\nJones:  He does a newsletter that I often look at, and he’s got, again, a very good tone, a very sensible tone to the whole approach to healthier food.\n\nQ:  And certainly that book, it wasn’t presented as offbeat.\n\nJones:  No.\n\nQ:  It was user-friendly.\n\nJones:  Yes.  Yes.  But I’d never cook any of that stuff.  I mean, what’s the point?\n\nQ:  You know, I don’t know how you react to this, but one conversation that I find I have with so many people who, if I invite them to dinner, come over and they say, “Well, you don’t use olive oil, do you?  Olive oil is fattening.”  So I go into my little lecture about good fats and bad fats and how olive oil is the perfect food, and, obviously, restraint in the amount that you’re eating has much more to do with it than the ingredients.  But do people ever accuse you of promoting recipes that are not healthful because they are traditional and used—\n\nJones:  You mean in the books of the people I work with?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJones:  Yes, there’s always someone won’t buy a certain book, but that isn’t who we’re publishing for.  That’s specialty publishing, as far as I’m concerned.\n\nQ:  When confronted with that question of how things are fattening, do you talk about appropriate amounts or what?\n\nJones:  I always quote Julia, and that is, try to eat a little bit of everything in small portions, not huge portions, and don’t eat between meals.  She doesn’t say and don’t eat junk food and don’t drink junk soda, but I wouldn’t dream of eating junk food and junk soda.  I mean, I’ve psyched myself so that they’re almost sickening to me.  When I have young people around and they drink all this pop, I won’t buy it for them.  They have to go out and get it.\n\nQ:  Well, they don’t—I mean, nobody needs it, but—\n\nJones:  And I think you find your own level—every body has its own balance of input and outtake, and I know what I can eat. If I’ve eaten an enormous meal the night before, I just don’t want that much the next day.  I’m sure there’s an inner discipline going on there.\n\n[Passage deleted by Jones]\n\n\nQ:  This list of books, of course, does go on to include more American books.\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Actually, the first one, I suppose, being Craig Claiborne’s Kitchen Primer, which I always liked.\n\nJones:  It’s a nice little book.\n\nQ:  I thought that was a neat little book.\n\nJones:  It didn’t go as far as I would have liked him to go in that, in terms of teaching the basics.\n\nQ:  But it did, as I recall anyway, give you confidence about some basic things like meatloaf or—I can’t remember.\n\nJones:  Yes, and you learned the terms.  You learned what it was all about.  Yes.\n\nQ:  I couldn’t tell whether that was 1969 or ’72 or whether ’72 was a reprint or reissue, rather.\n\nJones:  I think it probably was ’72, yes.\n\nQ:  Then, of course, there was The New Orleans Cookbook by Rima and Richard Collin and then Edna Lewis’s The Taste of Country Cooking.  Did you work only on the thirtieth anniversary edition in 2006?  [Passage edited for clarity.]\n\nJones:  Oh, The Taste of Country Cooking. Oh yes. I worked with that.  Yes, that was an interesting story, because Bob Bernstein, who was the president of Random House, asked me to see Edna Lewis and her collaborator, who were having a book published.  I think it was by Dodd Mead.  I said, “Well, I’ll see them, but if she’s having the book published”\nHe said, “Well, talk to her.”  He knew the co-author who was doing the writing.\n\nQ:  So this was the later book that Scott Peacock—\n\nJones:  No, this is the first one. [We did do a 30th anniversary edition of The Taste of Country Cooking, and I wrote an introduction to that.]\n\nQ:  The first one.  Aha.\n\nJones:  They came in to see me, and I was immediately struck by Edna.  She was so beautiful and animated and talked about food in such a lovely way. She described where she grew up, living on a farm in a town called Freetown, which her grandfather had established made up of several communal farms.  It was as though food were the reward for everything in life.  You worked hard, but as long as you had this pleasure, it wasn’t work.\nThe book they were doing, which was The Edna Lewis Cookbook, that already was in galleys, so there wasn’t any hope or question of our taking it over.\nAnyway, I looked at it, and it didn’t reflect what I had seen in her, so I said, “Well, the book I’d love is one about your childhood and growing up in Virginia in a farm community.  Go home and put down some of the things you’ve just told me.”\n\tWell, she went home with the collaborator, and they tried writing what she’d told me.  But it wasn’t the same, and I said, “It’s not you.”\nWhereupon this woman, the collaborator, was a friend of Bernstein, got up and said, “You know, I think I should leave,” and she didn’t say it defensively but with great dignity and grace.\n\nQ:  That was very graceful.\n\nJones:  She said, “I think you two should be working together.”\n\tSo I got Edna to write by coming once a week for over a year to my office on her day off. She was working at the Natural History Museum on tours with children.  And she’d bring me notes and recipes and we’d talk all afternoon.  Then I’d say, “Go home and write it all down.”  It was just amazing.  She had that gift of telling a story.  She needed a little punctuation and sometimes the subject didn’t agree with the verb, but it was lovely.\n\tOnce, I asked her, “You know, Edna, we’ve got all these holidays.  We haven’t got Thanksgiving.”\n\tAnd she was silent for a moment, and then said, “Well, we didn’t celebrate Thanksgiving.  We celebrated Emancipation Day.” So I got her to tell me about that, and we did a menu of an Emancipation Day dinner.\nAnd that’s how that all happened.  To me it was one of the most beautiful experiences I had in publishing.  That’s how books should happen.  It’s there inside the right person. \n\nQ:  So it sounds like that has been part of your technique, talking to people.  I mean, we’ve said many times that you ask questions, but is it almost like interviewing them or getting to know them, or what is it that helps you intuit how to help them tell their story?\n\nJones:  I don’t know.  I suppose it’s really different for each, and sometimes it doesn’t particularly work.  But when it starts to happen and somebody has so much to say, as she did about her kind of southern cooking, which was very refined. (I mean, she wasn’t for chittlins).  And then later she did the book with Scott Peacock.  Or she did one other book and then one with Scott.\n\nQ:  What about Marion Cunningham and The Fannie Farmer Cookbook?  She had never done something like this before, is that right?\n\nJones:  No. \n\nQ:  So how did you work with her?  That was 1996.\n\nJones:  Well, about the first revision of The Fannie Farmer that we did: I knew that the Fannie Farmer people were looking for a new publisher, and I was not interested, because I thought it had become a bad book.  It was a book I grew up on, but—\n\nQ:  Who is the “they” that were looking for—\n\nJones:  Well, it was the Fannie Farmer Corporation, and what really had happened is that nobody in the family was really a cook-teacher who could take over, and in subsequent editions they just hired somebody to do the recipes. They were mostly what I call boxtop recipes, of no consequence.  So I didn’t want to do the book.  I think because I didn’t, Frank Benson, president of the Fannie Farmer Company wanted to see me to know why.  Of course, I liked him and we got to talking, and I told him it had become a bad book, and I wouldn’t touch it unless we could get somebody to revamp the whole thing and become the voice of Fannie Farmer in the twentieth century.  So he said, “Who would do it?”\n\tWell, I hadn’t the faintest idea, and particularly to do it just for a fee, because they weren’t quite willing to give up—\n\nQ:  The rights.\n\nJones:  —the rights, the full rights in it.  That was when I turned to Jim Beard because you could call him about anything and he’d find an answer.  He showed me some of his correspondence with Marion Cunningham and, told me about how she worked with him in his classes in Oregon in the summer. Just reading those letters and knowing what went on between them, I felt—\n\nQ:  So you knew she wasn’t a professional cook, but you had a sense of her from the letters?\n\nJones:  A sense of her from the letters, her taste, her instinct about what was genuine American, what had happened to some of the good old-fashioned cakes, how we’d made them in the past and how we’d ruined them through processed food. Things like that. \n\tSo she came East and she met in my office with Frank Benson. We talked a long time and there was something so radiant about her.  And he said, “Well, I want to take you ladies out to lunch,” in a lovely old-fashioned New England way.  We went to a little bistro down the street, and he asked, “Now, would you ladies like a cocktail?”\n\tAnd Marion smiled this beatific smile, and she said, “Oh no, I’m an alcoholic.”  Did you know that story?  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Yes.  It’s a great story.\n\nJones:  So wonderful.  And later he told me that that sold him, totally.  I mean, that’s a very courageous thing to do, isn’t it?\n\nQ:  Oh, enormously.  But how much did you have to help her as she worked her way through the book?\n\nJones:  Oh, I had to get more people.  I realized I’d taken on an impossible task, and we got somebody to do the preserving, and whittle that chapter down, because nobody really does that kind of preserving.\n\nQ:  You mean the recipes for— \n\nJones:  Yes.  And we got somebody to do the desserts.  No, Marion did the desserts.  Nobody would do the jellied salads, and there must have been sixty.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Of course.\n\nJones:  So I offered to take on that and, of course, I threw out all the ones that were just Jello salads.\n\nQ:  Ghastly.\n\nJones:  I think the section was reduced to about six recipes.  So we really all pitched in, and that was fun.\n\nQ:  But you can’t do an American cookbook like that without jellied salads.\n\nJones:  You have to have some.\n\nQ:  You have to.\n\tWhen you look at this list and the progression, could you reflect back and tell me what you see about what’s happened to cooking in America during this period of time that you’ve been editing these books?\n\nJones:  Well, as always, there’s the good and there’s the bad or the sad. While I think that we opened up as Americans and learned so much, I’m saddened that a lot of it was exploited into what I think the Food Network is doing today.  Their motto is “We’re not just about food; we’re about entertainment.”  Well, it doesn’t have to be entertainment and then often such sloppy cooking.  I turned on something I seldom watch and there were four youngish women, each doing a dish she would make.  I wouldn’t have wanted to make one of those dishes.  One of them had cubes of chicken and I counted how long they were in the pot of water that was boiling, boiling, boiling.  Something like forty-five minutes.\n\nQ:  [laughs] They were stones.\n\nJones:  I just think, oh, all the work I’ve done over the years to try to awaken us to that instinct, that sense of what makes really fine cooking, and subtle cooking, delicious cooking, and then you see someone just throwing things together and boiling them.  I don’t know.  I feel I don’t know how to fight it anymore.\n\nQ:  I don’t know whether people really cook from those programs.\n\nJones:  I don’t think they do, but they buy the books.\n\nQ:  They do buy the books.\n\nJones:  As old Alfred [Knopf] used to say, “Every penny that goes to somebody else’s book doesn’t go to your book.”  [laughs]  But on the other hand, on the good side, I think of really how worthwhile books have made a place for themselves, become good backlist items and made a genuine contribution.  \n\nQ:  Made a place for themselves in the development of cooking in America, or what?\n\nJones:  Yes.  And in enlightening people.\n\nQ:  We have more knowledge.\n\nJones:  Oh yes.  And certainly our tastes are more discriminating—although there are still people I just don’t think have any cooking genes, and you can try forever.  You’re not going to make—what is it?—a silk purse out of a sow’s ear?  [laughter]\n\nQ:  I’m going to ask you to think back also a little bit about Jim Beard and tell me, if you can, when you think about him now, who is it that you see?\n\nJones:  Who is it I see?\n\nQ:  Yes.  In terms of not the physical person, but in terms of his contribution.\n\nJones:  Well, I think he did several things.  One, he made the man in the kitchen an attractive, forceful, convincing kind of person, promoting barbecuing outside and relishing all the good western cooking.  So that was important.  I think he released men in that sense, and he just was so knowledgeable about what American food was and everything that went into it and so generous in terms of helping others in that same direction.\n\tTo me, he exemplified what cooking should be, which is fun and creative and something you enjoy, not something that you think of as a chore.  He enjoyed it so much.  I can remember when we would be working together, he’d start getting hungry around twelve o’clock, and he could just go down to the kitchen and pull open the refrigerator door and stand there, this huge man, and kind of swing on it and pick out this and pick out that and a little of something else and suddenly make a pasta out of nothing or an egg dish or you name it, improvising was all part of the pleasure.  And that’s what we need. We still haven’t gotten over this love/hate relationship as Americans.\n\nQ:  With food.\n\nJones:  I don’t think any country is as screwed up as we are about food.\n\nQ:  Talk about that a little bit.\n\nJones:  Well, I think it goes partly back to the Puritan heritage and, as I said, what the food industry did. You can’t generalize too much, because there’s no one nature to Americans.  We’re a big mix.  But there just seems to be a resistance to understanding that food is a part of life. It’s one of the great gifts, so let’s enjoy it, instead of this other side saying, “Yes, but that’s not very good for you.”  It’s crazy.\n\nQ:  Do you think there’s a place for somebody like Jim Beard now, who expresses that enthusiasm and that permission to explore?\n\nJones:  I think it would be hard.  I don’t think that if Jim had been coming of age today, he would be the icon that he became.  They’d say he’s too fat.  Well, you know, there are fat and thin.  There’s blonde hair, dark hair.  And I’m not talking about the obese thing, but Jim got pretty heavy and struggled with health as a result, but what shone forth in him was this sheer joy. He was that way about the opera. About books-- I’d send him a book, and the next morning he’d call me and have read it.  Just an exuberance about life, and I feel that goes with food.  I find that in Lidia Bastianich.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJones:  She’s got it.\n\nQ:  And those television segments are among the few I can watch.\n\nJones:  Yes.  And I find that people feel that way all over the country, wherever I’ve gone and talked to people.  They respond like that, so that’s a good sign.\n\nQ:  You mentioned that your next book is on Cooking for One?\n\nJones:  Yes.\n\nQ:  When will that come out?\n\nJones:  It’s coming out the end of September, and I really wrote it because I found that so many people asked me if there is really a good book on the subject. They complain that it’s so hard not to waste and you spend too much money. How do you make it all work?  And it’s for people who want to make good food.  It’s not for those who just want to slap together prepared foods, but for the sheer pleasure of saying, “What am I going to make tonight?”  A lot depends on your mood, whether you’ve had a big lunch, what you may have in the fridge. It’s extremely creative to me and very settling, very mindful. It’s good for people getting old too.  You have to pay attention.  [laughter]  But it’s also good for young people.\n\nQ:  But it does bring back at least the pleasure principle—\n\nJones:  Absolutely, yes.\n\nQ:  —as something that we need to think of when we think of eating.\n\nJones:  Yes.  It’s one of the great pleasures of life.  As Brillat-Savarin said, “They last the longest to console us when we outlive the rest.”\n\nQ:  I think that’s a perfect way to finish this conversation.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJones – 2 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n","description":"Judith Jones first made her mark in publishing as a young woman working in the Paris office of Doubleday, when she came upon a manuscript of The Diary of Anne Frank in a reject pile and enthusiastically recommended it for publication.

Their association began when she was hired to supervise and write much of The Cook's Catalogue, a book edited by Beard with Milton Glaser and Burton Richard Wolf in 1975. She continued to work with him, teaching classes at his cooking schools in California and New York, and helping him with his writing. After Beard's death, she put together The James Beard's Celebration Cookbook in order to raise money for the James Beard Foundation. Kafka's own exhaustively-researched single-subject cookbooks ( Vegetables, Roasting, Microwave Cooking) have set a standard for excellence. In 2007, Kafka received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the James Beard Foundation.TTT\n\nInterviewee:  Barbara Kafka\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t           New York City\n\nDate:  April 3, 2009\n\nQ:  It’s April 3, 2009.  This is Judith Weinraub, and I’m sitting with Barbara Kafka in her home on New York’s Upper East Side.\nGood morning, Barbara.\n\nKafka:  Good morning.\n\nQ:  The Upper East Side seems to have been the place where you’ve really spent so much of your life.\n\nKafka:  Yes, indeed.  My parents—well, yes.\n\nQ:  I have been able to read the least about it, except that you went out to restaurants with your parents, and they were fine restaurants.  Could you tell me—\n\nKafka:  But they were not on the Upper East Side.\n\nQ:  I tell you what.  Let’s go back a bit and see.  Could you tell me where and when you were born and tell me something about your childhood and your early years?\n\nKafka:  August 6, 1933, I was born.  My parents, I like to say, were both self-made men.\n\nQ:  How so?\n\nKafka:  My father was an immigrant from the Pale of Settlement in Minsk near Pinsk and [unclear], and my mother was born in this country to a family of ardent socialists.  Her father, a very good-looking, rather small man, built houses—bungalows they were in those days—in Rockaway, and very much like the Woody Allen movie.  It was only on Saturdays that he took children to the theater.  It was only on Yom Kippur that he went shopping for groceries and carried them home.\nA famous family story, he was up in the upstairs room, there was a fire in the house, he was throwing books out the window, and yelling, “Dora!  Get the children!” Dora being his wife.  It was a tradition in which men were learned, basically, although he did do physical labor, and women worked.\n\nQ:  Women worked at home?\n\nKafka:  No.  No, no, no.  Women worked.\n\nQ:  Doing what kinds of things?\n\nKafka:  Well, my grandmother had a shop, that grandmother.  And my other grandmother, my father’s mother, was quite an extraordinary woman.  Unfortunately, by the time I knew her, she was quite old.  She had had a busy life, and they had not come to this country till after husband died.  She had met her husband, I guess she was about sixteen or seventeen.  He was married, she fell in love, and then her sister died, leaving two small children, and she was, as they were in those days, married off to the widower to bring up the children.\nShortly thereafter, the invalid wife of her love died, and she went around the Pale of Settlement on foot and gathered together a minion of elders and got permission to leave the man to whom she was married if she would take the children and rear them.  Her then to-be husband had already two children.  So she started married life at eighteen or nineteen with four children.  She then proceeded to have nine of her own, of which two died; they were premature twins.  She had a bakery, a restaurant, it was sort of an inn, and an apple orchard, and she raised the children.\n\nQ:  What energy.\n\nKafka:  Her husband was a Yeshiva Bocher.  He was a scholar and he did not work.  They were already unusual in that they sent the children to gymnasium during the day and Cheder, Jewish school, at night.\n\nQ:  Boys and girls?\n\nKafka:  Boys and girls.  And, unfortunately for my grandmother, her eldest daughter, who was her helpmate, fell in love with one of the teachers at the gymnasium, a Russian, and married him and moved to Moscow, and my grandmother couldn’t go visit them because Jews were not allowed in Moscow at that time.\n\nQ:  Heartbreaking.\n\nKafka:  And when her husband died, she sent the two oldest boys, not her children, but one from each of the adopted families, to America to see if it was all right, and they wrote back that it was fine.  And she sold everything and took all these children on a boat to America.  Got to America, Ellis Island, the two boys met them, and my father supported them financially till the end of their lives, because they arrived at the boat with American clothes, plus fours and what have you, and took their Russian velvet clothes with the caracal collars and threw them into the water.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.  What a dramatic gesture and great story.\n\nKafka:  Well, they were not to be greenhorns and they were not to be laughed at.  They took all of them to an apartment they had rented on the Lower East Side, and my grandmother took one look at the place and she said, “We will stay here tonight.  Tomorrow we move.  I did not come all the way to America to live in a ghetto.”  And she moved them to upper Broadway.\n\nQ:  Upper Broadway then was where?\n\nKafka:  In the nineties.  It was Irish, and my father recalls being beaten up every day on the way to school.  He delivered newspapers, and sometimes up flights of stairs, and didn’t get paid.  He had public education.  Every one of her children, including grown men, completed American school.  If she had to send them back to sit in kindergarten, they did, and all of them went to college and half of them had graduate degrees.  I mean, she meant what she said.  So she was a quite an outstanding presence.\nMy father went to CCNY, and then he took a one-year business degree at NYU, which he paid for.  Then he went to work at Gimbel’s and became quite shortly the china and the glass buyer, which I think had a big influence on my life.\n\nQ:  How so?\n\nKafka:  He loved glassware, he really did, and later in his life in his business life, he commissioned a lot of it, and I have a plethora of glasses for wine and so forth, and I think that was an influence in my life, and table settings and what have you.\nIn any case, not too long thereafter—I mean, when I say self-made, he bought into a business, a cosmetic and perfume business, and had a low-end cosmetic business, which then financed the other thing.\n\nQ:  Financed the—\n\nKafka:  The high-end.  The only thing I really remember about it—it was called Xanadou, and it was sold in the five-and-ten and so forth—was we had a big woven bamboo trunk that things had come in, and there were many, many Chinese coins in it, because the stuff came from China and the coins were used as packing material.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nKafka:  They were worthless.  In any case, the upper-end business was a perfume business, and he became a partner with a French owner, Jacques Guerin, who had an enormous influence on my mind.\n\nQ:  In terms of how you saw what?\n\nKafka:  Oh, dear.  Jacques was a great collector and extremely knowledgeable, very good-looking, gay, as we said in those days.  And, unlike myself, an amasser, he was a collector.  He ran this perfume business and he, however, would go during the long French lunch hour every day to the museums and the booksellers and what have you.  After the Second World War, he offered to give the Louvre his collection of Soutines.  He had one third of all the Soutines in the world.  He helped support Soutine.  Madame Gastain [phonetic] who had been Soutine’s mistress, had another third.  He said he would give it to them if they gave a room in perpetuity to the collection.  They refused, and so he didn’t give it.  And then, of course, for years thereafter, the curator sat on his doorstep trying to get it.\nWhen Proust died, he went to Proust’s home—he knew the family—and offered to buy whatever they would sell.  There had been a great scandal about some author’s letters somewhat prior to this, and so he promised to never publish them, and he didn’t.\n\nQ:  That’s amazing.\n\nKafka:  His bedroom was Proust’s study, with the cork-lined walls.  He bought all of it.  He had all the original manuscripts, and so that was one collection.\nThen he had enough Blue Period Picassos that the dining room in the country was called the Blue Room.  A man died in the suburbs of Paris. Before the Second World War, the French had the right to quarry marble in the famous Roman—it was auctioned off.  And when the man died, he went out to his house and saw the most hideous house you have ever seen, it was stucco, and into it were plunged pieces of marble that the man had brought back from the quarry, sort of randomly.  Jacques said that he would build the family a new house instead of this monstrosity, and all he wanted was the marble, for which he got the back of a torso of a Greek fifth-century boy, two heroic-size Roman  marble figures of women of some sort or another, and various other Roman portrait heads and what have you.  So that’s what I mean when I say he was a great collector.\nWhen he learned that I was interested in cookbooks, he bought me a Pauline de Rothschild’s copy of Bab because I said I admired Ali Bab.  It was the second edition, which was the first complete edition, and a collector’s item.\n\nQ:  This would have been when you were approximately how old?\n\nKafka:  I was already doing cooking, so I must have been twenty-five, twenty-six, something like that.\n\nQ:  How old were you when you got to know him?\n\nKafka:  I was about seven.  There’s a famous novel written about him called The Bâtard.  He was a bastard, literally, I could go on about him forever, but I don’t think you want me to.\n\nQ:  No, that’s all right.  In terms of the influence on you, how did it affect the way you saw things or proceeded in life?\n\nKafka:  The level of culture and of involvement in the arts that I didn’t know.  My parents, my mother, the other self-made man to whom we have not yet gotten, they were interested in politics and proceeding in life.  They had many interesting friends, but they were not at that time primarily interested in the arts.  They were not opera-goers or symphony-goers.  After my father became involved with Jacques and after the Second World War, they began buying art and they had a very nice collection.\n\nQ:  When you say “they,” at this point you mean—\n\nKafka:  My parents.  And so I was exposed to a world.  There was another Frenchman, and I speak French really quite perfectly because to me it was culture, you see, and also during the Second World War there were a lot of French children who were here, whose fathers were either with the Resistance or were Jewish who were sent out of the country.  The other was a man named Edouard “Ducky” Cournand, Ducky because he was with the Lafayette Escadrille during the First World War, and they all had nicknames.  His brother won a Nobel Prize, a very nasty man.  He, however, inserted through his own arm a catheter into his heart.\n\nQ:  For a purpose.\n\nKafka:  Yes.  He was a doctor.\n\nQ:  Do you have siblings?\n\nKafka:  No, I have no siblings.  I was the only child.  My mother, I don’t think, really wanted children.  She did what she had to do.  Certainly sex was not her favorite game, although she was very flirtatious and seductive with men.\nIn any case, she was the middle of three children.  Her older brother became a judge, rather, the highest court in New York State.  I mean, they were also encouraged to achieve.  I mean, that’s what they had in common, let’s say, with my father’s parents, my father’s mother.  She also put herself through school.  She went to Hunter, and in those days, you could go to law school at night while you were still in college, and she went to NYU law school, and she was the first woman graduate of NYU law school.\nAfter she graduated, she got a Susan B. Anthony Fellowship, like that, to Bryn Mawr and took her degree in social engineering, which in those days was where—I forget, Gilbreth’s Cheaper by the Dozen, not—\n\nQ:  I’m sorry.  This was after her law school graduation?\n\nKafka:  Yes, after college and law school, which coincided.  She taught French when she was in college to pay her way, English as a second language.\n\nQ:  So this set fairly high standards for you, all of this.\n\nKafka: Oh, yes. And she came back to New York—she was the original asker after I got a 95 on an exam: Where are the other five points?\nShe came back to New York and took a degree in social work, and because she could not as a woman get a job with a law firm, they offered her secretarial jobs and so forth.  My mother never learned to cook, she didn’t keep house, and she didn’t learn to type.  She would not do any of the expected woman’s jobs.  Finally, after another job that she had, a management consultancy job, she met my father and, being seductive, she took him away from her employer’s daughter, whom he was seeing.  She got a job with the U.S. government, which would employ women.\n\nQ:  In New York?\n\nKafka:  In New York.  She became regional attorney for the Social Security Administration, which was new, and helped write the original Social Security legislation, was down in Washington a lot for that.  Ann Rosenberg, who was an extraordinary woman as well, was always the regional director, and she was the regional attorney.  Before that, she had argued a case before the Supreme Court, the NRA case, which they lost.\nThen with the Second World War, Social Security was expanded to be the War Manpower Commission, and she was regional attorney for the War Manpower Commission, which was Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, so a large part of the economy.  So when I say “two self-made men,” I’m being quite literal.\n\nQ:  When did you come along in their marriage?\n\nKafka:  She was, I think, twenty-seven.\n\nQ:  And doing what when you were born?\n\nKafka:  Working.\n\nQ:  At which of these—\n\nKafka:  I don’t know.  I was not exactly conscious at the time.  [laughs]  But they had been living in the Village.  My mother, to show you how upwardly mobile she was, she would not buy furniture because they didn’t have enough money.  She rented furniture because she knew that some day she was going to get real furniture, and she waited.  They took an apartment then on West End Avenue, which was the first place I lived, and the only things I remember about it were it had a large terrace which had like a cage over it and a sunken living room, very chic in those days.\n\nQ:  Very glam, yes.\n\nKafka:  But she was still on the move, and they moved to East 85th Street when I was about three, I guess.\nThen a very important person, influence, entered my life, a woman named Rachel Welman.  An unusual background, a black Canadian woman raised by the Salvation Army, and she cooked brilliantly.  In those days, it didn’t require much money to have household help.  We were in the Depression.  When my parents got married, it was 1929, and they were on the boat coming back when the crash happened.\nRachel was a brilliant cook.  One meets geniuses in cooking capacities, and she was.  My mother could describe anything to her, and she could make it.  She was shocked, however, once, the first year she was there, when she offered to make the Passover dinner.  She’d worked for a Jewish family before, and my mother explained that, of course, they didn’t observe.  But I remember her coming for the interview, so I was about three years old.\n\nQ:  For a black Canadian who grew up in the Salvation Army, where did she learn how to cook?\n\nKafka:  One has no idea how she turned out to be such a brilliant cook.  I mean, I’m sure in the Salvation Army they taught them the rudiments of cooking as appropriate to girls in those days, sewing, cooking.  My mother couldn’t sew either.  She could do a hem, very badly.  But Rachel just had the gift.  And she was very devout.  She was an aficionado—I use the word advisedly—of Father Divine.  She used to go there during her summer vacation, or whenever her vacation was.  And she had a son.  The son was married.  They had a daughter, Florence.\n\nQ:  And was she living with you?\n\nKafka:  She lived with us.  Oh yes.  And considering what a liberal my mother was, the maids’ rooms were appalling.  But I grew up really without any stigma about black people.  I did not cook with Rachel.  Everybody always asks me.  The only thing she let me do was occasionally beat batter for cake, always in one direction.  You never changed direction.  But other than that, I never cooked with her.  She didn’t want anybody mussing in her kitchen.\n\nQ:  Did you want to?\n\nKafka:  I don’t know.  I loved to eat.\nThen my mother, when we got to just before the beginnings of the war when the news coming out of Germany was very bad, out of Europe, typical of my mother being a social contrarian, found me a German nanny, who then went back to join the Third Reich, and I had German frauleins all during my growing-up because my mother was never home or not home much.\nI became very close to my father.  I like men a lot.  And although he had a fierce temper, I learned to stand up, and I think it’s how I later knew how to deal in French kitchens, where I would be the first woman they’d ever seen in the kitchen and telling them what to do, moreover.\n\nQ:  I would have liked to have seen that.\n\nKafka:  Well, I’m small.  I always looked young.  And I learned to say, when they offered to carry a pot for me, “Ma chère, let me carry that for you.”\n“Get the fuck out of my way.  I can carry it myself.”\n\nQ:  We’ll get back to what you were talking about, but when would that have been when you were working in French kitchens?\n\nKafka:  Working for Joe Baum at Windows.\n\nQ:  Where did you go to school?\n\nKafka:  I went to the best school I have ever been at, which was the Lincoln School.  Not the new Lincoln School, which came after, but the old Lincoln School was a Rockefeller Grant school administered by Teachers College.  That was for gifted children.\n\nQ:  So was that at Columbia?\n\nKafka:  No, it was in its own building in the middle of Harlem, right on Morningside Park when I first went.  I had no fear of that, even though routinely Morningside Park would be roped off because someone had been killed in it.  But it was an experimental school long before that became popular.\n\nQ:  Experimental, how so?\n\nKafka:  We were taught geometry at maybe six or seven, and the way we were taught was, for instance, they would put two dots on a board, and we were given, I guess, no ruler, but a protractor, and we were challenged to find the center point.\n\nQ:  That’s challenging.\n\nKafka:  There was the librarian—it was a wonderful, very good library—named Miss Eaton, E-a-t-o-n, who was for many years the children’s book reviewer for the New York Times.  I think she was married, but I’m not sure.  She was Miss Eaton.  And I was a voracious reader.  That I remember clearly.  Four years old, I’m sitting on the can in the morning, because the German nanny said you had to go before you went out the house, and I had a book open in front of me.  I was looking at pictures, and suddenly I realized I could read.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nKafka:  And I never stopped.  I would take books out of the library, two, three at a time, and I would bring them back the next day, and Miss Eaton thought I was showing off.  So she sat down with me very nicely and started talking to me about the books, and she had realized that I’d read them, and then she began supplying me with literature, wonderful literature.\n\nQ:  You were how old at that point, ballpark?\n\nKafka:  I must have been five.\n\nQ:  Good heavens.\n\nKafka:  And she began supplying me with books.  When I was eleven, she gave me Jane Austen, and that was transformative.  So she was another enormous influence.  At Christmastime, she used to tell the story of the Christmas rose.\n\nQ:  I don’t know that story.\n\nKafka:  It’s an Oscar Wilde story about the nightingale who pierces its breast, a sad, tragic, wonderful story about self-sacrifice for art.\nI became a dancer at four.  My mother had very close friend, Sidney Cohn, C-o-h-n, without an e, who was a lawyer and, while not himself a communist, was married to a woman who was probably a communist, Vera Boudin Cohn.  And if the name Boudin rings a bell, that was her niece.\n\nQ:  You mean Kathy Boudin?\n\nKafka:  Kathy Boudin.  It was Vera’s father’s firm.  So Sidney represented quite a few of the Hollywood Ten, including Carl Foreman.  He adored my mother.  Vera was crazy as a loon and finally committed suicide jumping off a boat.  He used to come over and play gin with my mother.  She was a lethal gin player.  He was important.  When I went off to college, Radcliffe, he took me to Brentano’s, which was then on Fifth Avenue on the West Side, and he bought me a library.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nKafka:  I could pick what I wanted, and I went off to Radcliffe with a library.  It was small, but the idea was so important.  The respect was so important.\n\nQ:  Were they reference books or classics or what?\n\nKafka:  Reference books and poetry primarily.  Very interested in poetry.\nSo anyhow, he was the lawyer, when I was a child, for Massine.  I had been taken to the ballet, and I declared—I was very determined—that I was going to be a dancer, and my parents explained to me that at four years old you could not be a dancer.  Then they had Sidney talk to me, and he explained to me that four-year-old—and I stamped my little feet.  So finally they said that if I talked to Massine and he told me, would I accept it.  “Yes,” I said.  So I went to a rehearsal studio, and he had me do some things and he took me on.\n\nQ:  Oh, how spectacular.\n\nKafka:  Until he went back to Europe.  Then I, years later, met his son, who knew about me.  But when I gave up ballet and went to college, he ceased talking to me.\n\nQ:  Massine?\n\nKafka:  Yes.\n\nQ:  You were short for a dancer, though?\n\nKafka:  Not in those days.\n\nQ:  Really?\n\nKafka:  Oh no.\n\nQ:  I didn’t realize that.\n\nKafka:  In those days, you were supposed to be small and light so men could lift you.  Think of Danilova.  Think of Markova.  They were all short.\n\nQ:  I had no idea how tall they were.\n\nKafka:  They were all short, all about 5’2”, all about my height.  Those were the three baby ballerinas.  Baronova was somewhat taller, but maybe no more than 5’5”.  These great tall creatures they have today would not have made it, would not have been accepted.\n\nQ:  Before we get you to Radcliffe, what was that business in your Lifetime Achievement citation [from the James Beard Foundation] about your eating out with your parents at fine restaurants?\n\nKafka:  Well, as I say, my mother didn’t cook.  Rachel cooked, but Rachel even then was given a day off, Thursdays and Sundays.  Thursdays, I was at home and given something or other, but Sundays we often went out because Mother didn’t cook.  And then when my mother was going to Washington a great deal, my father, I think as a form of unspoken retaliation, used to take me to restaurants with him, which is when I remember the Chambord.\n\nQ:  Oh, that’s pretty good.\n\nKafka:  Oh, yes, yes.  That was then on Third Avenue.  We’re not ever going to see restaurants like that again.  They would make you any classic dish from the French repertoire—they were not into nouvelle cuisine, obviously—if they had the ingredients in the house.  They had a glass window onto the kitchen.\n\nQ:  Oh, really advanced.\n\nKafka:  Yes, it was in the back, a glass widow, and you could see the copper pots hanging.  There were nothing but copper pots.  There was no aluminum in that kitchen, I assure you.\nAnd I suppose the most notable experience from my point of view was sitting with my father on Third Avenue.  They had a few tables outside, and my father was presented with the wine list, and he ordered a 1919 wine.  1919 was the great vintage, say, until ’72, you know, acclaimed in that way—’45.  But, of course, that was during the war, but ’45 was after the war.  France was celebrating as if the hills were celebrating.  And the, I don’t know, wine steward, captain, whatever, came over for my father to taste the wine, and he pointed at me and he said, “She’ll taste it.”\n\nQ:  That’s fabulous.\n\nKafka:  Well, what greater seduction.\n\nQ:  And you were about how old?\n\nKafka:  Oh, I can’t have been more than ten or something.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nKafka:  ‘43.  It was during the war.\n\nQ:  So do you remember the kinds of things you would eat there?\n\nKafka:  Only the style, not the particular dishes.  They merge into other dishes.\n\nQ:  And the style would have been—\n\nKafka:  Classic French cuisine.\n\nQ:  And how different was that from what you were eating at home?\n\nKafka:  In part, different.  For instance, we went to Lafayette with my mother in the Village.  Not the Lafayette that you would remember, but there was one in Greenwich Village, which was wonderful.  It had a black and white tile floor next to the bar, which went lengthwise like a New York brownstone, except wider, and it had chess tables down the middle.  The same kind of people who later played chess in the park, in Washington Square Park, played chess at these tables. So you would walk down there, and then you’d walk into a big dining room with great starched white linen tablecloths and linen napkins.  And there I remember a dish, because it was my mother’s favorite, which was moules marinières.\n\nQ:  And you were little?\n\nKafka:  Well, it was all during the Second World War.  I was only twelve when the war ended.\n\nQ:  Yes, so you still were little.  Yes, that’s what I meant.\n\nKafka:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, Rachel was cooking what kinds of things at home?\n\nKafka:  Well, Mother would come back and would say that she—for instance, she had a sole dish, s-o-l-e, with wine and etc., and shallots and what have you.  I mean, she could describe the thing well.  She was a good eater.  And Rachel would make it.  But she would also make meatloaf and soups and a few Jewish specialties, a good brisket.  She made everything.  And we always had salad, my father loved salad, and we had a lot when there was company, with which I was included at a quite young age.  It was the period of sliced money on a plate, in my opinion; i.e., beef.  At my house, it was rare, which was unusual.\nThey went to Europe on their honeymoon, and my mother, my father offered her the classic diamond ring, and she said, no, she didn’t want it; she wanted to go to Europe.  And she got a jade ring, which I still have, and they went to Europe.  So this was always an ambition.  She learned to speak French very badly, I mean not illiterately, but the accent was appalling.  She had no ear, total tin ear, couldn’t carry a tune.  But, as I say, she wanted to go to France.\nThey went to Russia and met my father’s sister.  By that time they could go to Moscow.  And my aunt who I never met, Sonia, who was really my father’s mother in many ways, took my mother aside, according to my mother.  Mother was a consummate liar, a compulsive liar.  Took her aside and said, “Don’t let him go back to Slutz.  The apples are never as red as you think they were.”\n\nQ:  Oh, how wonderful.\n\nKafka:  It was a wonderful line.  My mother was a terrible liar, and my father and mother fought constantly.  Dinner table was a nightmare in that sense, so only the food was a saving grace.  My mother regularly left it in tears.\nWhen I was older, I went out with my father one day.  I don’t know.  We went from the garage to pick up a car, and they had been to see Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf the night before.  And I said, malice aforethought, “Tell me, Daddy, what did you think of the play?”\n\tAnd he said, “Your mother and I never used foul language.”  And it was just like that in my house when I was growing up, up to the adoptive child.\n\nQ:  Aha.\n\nKafka:  I was taken to my pediatrician’s office, which will get you back to how I reconstructed [that I had] celiac disease, and shown a beautiful blond baby and told that this was going to be my new brother.\n\nQ:  A picture or the real baby?\n\nKafka:  A real baby.  Years later, I got up the nerve to ask my mother whatever happened, and she said, “Oh, you didn’t want him.”\n\nQ:  Oh, my god.\n\nKafka:  Oh, she was not a nice—to me, not a good mother.\n\nQ:  Wow.  And there never was another adoptive child?\n\nKafka:  No.  It was the mythical, I mean really Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf.  You remember the mythical adoptive child in that?\n\nQ:  But you do remember being taken to the doctor’s office?\n\nKafka:  Yes.  He was Sidney Haas, he was my pediatrician for many years, and he invented the banana powdered diet for celiac babies.  And that is how I began to reconstruct, and the fact that there had been some deprivation as a child of food.\n\nQ:  So you think you had celiac disease long ago?\n\nKafka:  Yes, exactly.\n\nQ:  Consistently or—\n\nKafka:  You never get rid of it.  You go into a kind of remission, or many people do; some people never do.  Lactose intolerance is very much an Ashkenazi Jew phenomenon.  So the combination came back and hit me upside the head.\n\nQ:  And must have affected what you could and couldn’t eat comfortably.\n\nKafka:  You’re goddamned right.\n\nQ:  So when did your interest in food and in cooking develop?\n\nKafka:  Well, I was always interested in food.  My father, much to my mother’s upwardly mobile disgust, would pick up a sirloin steak bone and gnaw it.  He loved food.  He loved good wine.  My mother loved food, and Rachel was a great cook.  So I always loved good food.\n\nQ:  Were you curious about cooking it yourself?\n\nKafka:  No.  I mean, I had no other place to hang out when the frauleins were off.  I mean, you think I’m kidding?\n\nQ:  No, I don’t.  I don’t.\n\nKafka:  After the war in Germany was over, guess what my mother found me to take care of me?  A Japanese.\n\nQ:  She was quirky.\n\nKafka:  No, she wasn’t quirky; she was principled.\n\nQ:  I see.\n\nKafka:  And I paid for the principle.\n\nQ:  I bet.\n\nKafka:  One E.  One A. \nIn any case, when I went off to college—but I knew—to tell you again the disagreeable side of me, as I say, I’m opinionated.  That’s the name of one of my books, The Opinionated Palate.  I was going to name it The Omnivore, but my editor didn’t like that.  I thought I could do anything.  I wanted to dance, I danced.  I wanted to speak French, I spoke French.  I wanted to read, I read.  There were not great numbers of books in my house.  There were books.  My mother read mystery novels to go to sleep at night.  She had, for instance, a friend who was a professor, an assistant professor or something at Columbia, of modern literature, and he brought them a copy, which I still have, of the portable James Joyce.  Those were Viking, I think, editions.\n\nQ:  I can actually picture it, yes.\n\nKafka:  He had brought it to them as a gift, because he had edited it.  By this time, I was at Dalton, because after I left Lincoln because they shut down the experiment and merged it with Horace Mann, and then the Lincoln parents started another private school, but it was really not the same.  Then my mother wanted me to go to Dalton, and I didn’t want to go to Dalton.  I thought it was sloppy.\n\nQ:  Were you living on the East Side by that point?\n\nKafka:  Oh yes, we were living on 85th Street.  First, we lived on 85th Street between Park and Madison, just off Madison.  And then, still upwardly mobile, my mother finally moved us to 1016 Fifth Avenue, not on the park; we didn’t get that fancy.  But we had an apartment at 1016.  Then, finally, my father moved us, after the Second World War and after apartments became somewhat more available, to 1107 Fifth Avenue, which is right up here on 92nd Street.  So I went to Brearley and encountered discrimination for the first time in my life.\n\nQ: Wait a second.  You went to Dalton for a while?\n\nKafka:  I went to Brearley.  No.  First, I went to Brearley.  I did go to Dalton finally.  I went to Brearley and encountered discrimination for the first time in my life.  Jews were not acceptable.  I was too smart-assed, whereas before, I had been praised for being smart and verbal.\n\nQ:  Just plain smart, yes.\n\nKafka:  There were a couple Jews in my class, but they were definitely German Jews with a lot of money, the Strausses, who owned Macy’s, and Iris Love, whose mother was a Guggenheim, but whose father was Episcopalian.  But you have to remember that anti-Semitism was rife in those classes at that time, even later.  Anyhow, I stood it as long as I could.  Iris, you know, is gay.  Iris’ mother shipped her off to Madeira’s in Washington and told her she could come back after a year if she didn’t like it.  Of course, she never let her come back.\n\nQ:  Because?\n\nKafka:  She didn’t like her.  She liked Noelle, Iris’ older sister, who did the appropriate thing, who got married, who was pretty.  Iris was a big solid girl, and Iris stood up for me at Brearley, which I badly needed.  It was physically abuse.  And when she left, I basically called it a day.\nNow, Ducky Cournand’s daughter, Evie, was already at Brearley, which I think influenced me.  She was a year ahead of me at Brearley, and I wanted to skip and be in her class, and Brearley, of course, wouldn’t let me do that.  She was a very strange girl.  These are not, you know, odd remembrances.  Understandably, her mother died when she was quite young, and her parents were, I think, Hungarian immigrants.  Yes, Hungarian, Polacek.  And he had become very wealthy.  He did all the bronze work for Rockefeller Center, which is all bronze, all the fittings, and he gave the atlas to them as a gift of thank you when it opened.  We used to go out there on weekends—they lived on Long Island—and in the summer.  I mean, my mother had to do something with me, right?\n\nQ:  Right.\n\nKafka:  So when the fraulein when on vacation, I was shipped out to Long Island with Evie, and she was very odd and I disliked her.  She was also one of the reasons I learned French, because her governess, who was very important to her because she had no mother, and her governess, Moochie, was Swiss French.  And one of Evie’s way of avoiding me, since her father was also French, was to speak French.\nLest you think that I’m making up that she was odd, she committed suicide in her—she also was a dancer, but a very bad dancer.  But she had a lot of money, and she started a ballet company in which she performed.  When her teacher, who had been her cousin’s teacher but had sort of taken her over, died, which I guess was her second mother in some way—not one I would have chosen but her second mother—she jumped out a window.  So I mean, when I say odd—but on the other hand, her grandmother—it was a batty family.  I mean, what’s his name, Cournand was a mean son of a bitch.  Not Ducky; his brother.\n\nQ:  What kinds of meals did they have out there?  Do you remember?\n\nKafka:  The most revelatory food memory there was they had a cook.  The kitchen was in the basement.  It was a great big house on the sound side of Long Island, on the water.  I have two outstanding food memories.  One is the cook was Hungarian and used to stretch strudel dough on the kitchen table.  When I later tried to invent, because all of my cooking is self-invented basically from books and from doing, how to make strudel dough, nobody explained to me, really.  I mean, they said to me—but it kept breaking and tearing.  And I realized that her kitchen was always steamy, so I put water on to boil, and it became a piece of cake, almost literally.  She was very white, like the flour, and round and soft like the dough, and she made Hungarian food.  But I don’t think I was so involved about the process.  This miracle thing was wonderful.\nThen there was a weeping mulberry tree in the yard, black mulberries.  Most of the mulberry trees in America are white mulberries, such as you find in Turkey and were grown because we tried to start a silk industry here, and the white mulberries were grown to feed the silkworms.  But this was a black mulberry, and it was a weeping mulberry.  I don’t know if you have ever seen weeping mulberries—\n\nQ:  I don’t think so.\n\nKafka:  —but they go right down to the ground.  They look like great cascades.  I now have one, but it’s not black.  But, I mean, this tree stayed with me.  And we wore little white dresses, of course, and headbands.\n\nQ:  Little white dresses for dinner or for—\n\nKafka:  Always.  There were no pants then for little girls, certainly not in Mrs. Polacek’s house.  When we went underneath the mulberry tree, and we would eat the wonderfully fresh mulberries from the inside.  Nothing is a good as a mulberry when it’s ripe, but, of course, you never see them in the store because you can’t ship them.  They crush almost instantly.  And, of course, we came back covered with stains.  That was the other great food memory of that time.\nEvie used to be taken, and I would go with her, every weekend to the mausoleum of her mother, and she had to write a letter to her mother, and her grandmother made her stand there in the mausoleum and read it.  So she had every excuse for being peculiar, if you want.  Ducky tried with me, I mean he really tried, because it was a poisonous environment.   And, of course, my mother didn’t really buy me clothes.\n\nQ:  You’d be sent out there for a weekend, for a week, for what?\n\nKafka:  A couple weeks.\n\nQ:  A couple weeks at a time.\n\nKafka:  The vacation period of the fraulein.\nSo, anyhow, I finally left Brearley, which was just intolerable, and I went to Dalton, which was a failure, from my point of view, because I had succumbed to my mother.  But I did skip a grade, and I got out of there in two years, maybe three; I forget.  Anyhow, I had a wonderful teacher, who was impossible to most students, called Miss Downes.  She was roomed with Miss Seeger, who was Pete Seeger’s sister.\n\nQ:  Roomed with as in their offices or in their homes?\n\nKafka:  In their home, with Miss Seeger.  She did, however, after Miss Seeger died, go back to England and get married to a man who’d been her beau when she was young.  So whatever her life was, I don’t know, I cannot—but Miss Seeger obviously had a very literary association.  Her brother was a well-known war poet from the First World War.\nMiss Downes was the first good teacher, great teacher, I had after leaving Lincoln, and she was my homeroom teacher and she was my English teacher, she was an English teacher, and I don’t think she liked me very much at the beginning.  As I say, I was a smart-ass.  Then she told us to go home and read a book and come back and write a report on it.  Before that, she’d had us writing précis.  That was a very common way of teaching in those days.\nSo I found this book that this professor had given my mother and it had The Exiles in it, and I read The Exiles, which was his only play, and I read Dubliners.  And I went back and I wrote my report for Miss Downes, and she was ravished that I could read these things, (a), that I could understand them, and she asked me—I guess it was Portrait that she asked me finally, because the next night I read Portrait, and she asked me, “What is the most important thing in Portrait?”\n\tAnd I said, “It’s when he crosses the bridge and he goes from being a child to being a writer and a man.”\n\tAnd it was she, I’m sure, who got me.  I mean, I was very bright, I had very good grades, I had great test scores, but I was shown by the advisor at Radcliffe the letter she’d written for me, and she said, “Anybody who teaches this young woman is blessed.”\n\nQ:  Oh, that’s terrific.\n\nKafka:  And she blessed me.  She was rigorous.  She was not warm.  I don’t think I would have known how to deal with warmth.  But she was a tremendous asset and role model for literature.  So, literature and dance and eating and my father were the poles of my youth.\nI didn’t get involved in cooking at all until I was at Radcliffe, and I guess in my second year, a very clever group—I always dated guys who were older than I was until I married my husband, who’s nine months older than I, and this very clever group of young men at the law school decided that they would have a cooking contest and their girlfriends could cook a meal and then they would award a prize.\n\nQ:  You mean, you were going out with one of these guys?\n\nKafka:  Yes. Well, not seriously, I know.  So, of course, competition was never to be avoided, right?  So I cooked a dinner and I won the prize.\n\nQ:  And what did you cook?\n\nKafka:  I have no idea.  I have no idea.\n\nQ:  Do you remember being anxious about it, not at all anxious about it?\n\nKafka:  No, I wasn’t anxious.  I’d seen cooking done.  I’d seen people put their hands in food.  It never occurred to me that it was something I couldn’t do.\n\nQ:  Do you think it was a complete meal or a dish?\n\nKafka:  It was a complete meal.  Even a dessert, which I almost never make.  I mean, I make, but I don’t bake.  Rachel was a great baker.  I don’t bake.  But my mother was incredibly competitive, and, obviously, I chose fields in which she had no presence.\n\nQ:  Wisely.\n\nKafka:  Chicken.\n \nKafka:  I think I said in Soup that in the interstices of her accomplishments, I found a way of life and I found that people—then I got married.  I went to work for Farrar Strauss after I graduated.\n\nQ:  Wait a second.  When did you get married?\n\nKafka:  1959, I guess.  1954.  No, not 1954.  1955.\n\nQ:  And you had been out of school—\n\nKafka:  A year.  I knew him at college and he was—\n\n [Interruption]\n\nKafka:  After Farrar Strauss, I went to St. Louis because my husband was in medical school.\n\nQ:  Now, wait.  When were you at Farrar Strauss?\n\nKafka:  From my graduation in 1954 till I married.\n\nQ:  Doing what?\n\nKafka:  Working in the publicity department.  You don’t think we were allowed to be editors in those days.\n\nQ:  Definitely not, no.\n\nKafka:  And that’s how women acquired power in publishing, incidentally.  They did sub-rights and they did publicity.  Little did anybody know that those were going to be the money centers in the future.\nHowever, John Farrar was there and he was a lovely man, a recovering alcoholic, I believe.  He’d had an earlier publishing venture.  He gave a course, I think, at the Y for poets, and so I took that course because that’s how I envisaged myself.  That’s what I wanted to be.\nThen we moved to St. Louis and I started taking, at my mother’s pushing, a doctorate.\n\nQ:  Your husband was in medical school at that point?\n\nKafka:  Yes, in St. Louis, and so I was at Washington University, which had a perfectly filthy bad English department, whereas Harvard had had a wonderful department, although they didn’t teach American literature per se.  But I wrote my honors thesis on Emily Dickinson.  Still these many years later, here is Emily Dickinson.  That’s the [Brenda] Wineapple [book] that I’m reading.\nAnyhow, I started taking a doctorate in seventeenth century English literature, which I loved, and I’d had Douglas Bush at Harvard for that at Wash U.  It was a seminar course, and the man who taught the course had us all reading microfilm.  I don’t know if you’ve ever worked on microfiche.\n\nQ:  Yes.  Why were you doing that?\n\nKafka:  Because he had us reading Commonplace Books, because I think he thought we would discover the unpublished Donne poem and that would—\n\nQ:  Make everybody—\n\nKafka:  No, make him.\n\nQ:  Yes, I realize but—\n\nKafka:  No, he wouldn’t have given credit.  And in my typical charming fashion, I got through one of these sessions, or halfway through, and he called on me and I said, “If you were teaching contemporary American literature, we would all be reading the Ladies’ Home Journal.”\n\nQ:  How did that go over?  [laughs]\n\nKafka:  That was the end of that.  I was nutty as a fruitcake, incidentally.  I really was very odd at that point.  I was alone.  I didn’t know St. Louis.  I didn’t know people.\n\nQ:  You mean you didn’t have the support system of friends and family.\n\nKafka:  Nothing, no.  And I was odd, no doubt about it, I was odd.\nAnyhow, so I sort of took to my bed for a little bit, and then I got a job at Ozark Airlines in the PR department, doing their company newsletter mainly for employees, and we worked on a linotype machine setting hot type.  That was work.\n\nQ:  I know.\n\nKafka:  You ever worked on a linotype?\n\nQ:  I wasn’t allowed to touch it, but, yes, I know what they were like.\n\nKafka:  Bad, bad.  And finally I got a job at the C.V. Mosby Company.\n\nQ:  What was the C.V. Mosby Company?\n\nKafka:  C.V. Mosby Company was the only publishing company in St. Louis.  I mean, I was still on track trying to be a writer, and the C.V. Mosby Company was a medical journal and book publisher, and still exists, I believe, and was one of the largest in the country, and they made me a proofreader.  I had no idea how to read proof, but I knew how to read books.  So I went and I got a copy of the Oxford Guide to Proofreading, which has all the marks in it, and I started proofreading.  It was wonderful training for writing cookbooks.\n\nQ:  I bet it was.\n\nKafka:  Not only the proofreading, but the exactness that in medical texts, if you don’t get it right, people can die.  As a matter of fact, I had a fight with a contributor to a symposium, it was an eye surgeon, it was a group of eye surgeons, and he refused to change the description of an operation.  I said, “You know what you mean, but this could be read just the opposite way.”  And he wouldn’t change it.  I finally had to go to management and had them say they would have to get a lawyer and he would have to sign a release.\nWhile I was at that, I always had a talent for finding people, and we lived in an apartment, up four flights, I think.  I spent a lot of my life walking up four flights.  It was fairly near the medical school, and the man who owned it was a fabulous man called Fred Landesman.  His son, Rocco Landesman [now the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts] is [unclear], and Fred was a painter, a self-made man.  His mother had a tacky sort of secondhand shop and was a picker.  He started Gaslight Square, and in his first restaurant, the Crystal Palace, which then moved to Gaslight Square, they were nightclubs, and he had brought the Second City Compass people from Chicago.\n\nQ:  So the Crystal Palace was a what?\n\nKafka:  It was a restaurant and cabaret, because he was interested in the arts and theater.  He lived in a Sullivan house with one of those great arches over the doorway.\n\nQ:  Very nice.\n\nKafka:  He had a ballroom on the top floor, and he regularly had people coming through there.  Of course, Tennessee Williams, when he left home, went there.  I didn’t meet Tennessee Williams.  But he was another one of these important influences and men who believed in me.  Tried to seduce me; I wasn’t seduced.  I probably would have been if I’d known more, but I wasn’t.  But I remained friends with him and his wife.  She was busy being seduced by other people.\nHis brother was a man, another Landesman, who started a magazine called Neurotica in New York.  I mean, they were fabulous people.  Herb Gold was out there before he moved to California.  He was one of Paula Landesman’s lovers.  So in that sense, I found people, but they were not friends or relatives.  It was a different kind of thing.\n\nQ:  I understand.  Now, where and what were you eating?  Were you and your husband able to eat together?\n\nKafka:  Well, I cooked.  We had two burners and a sink, you know, like in a closet.  And I always cooked for people.  I never cooked for myself.  All these people who say, “I go home and I make myself a wonderful meal,” that’s not me.  That’s not I.\n\nQ:  Why is that?\n\nKafka:  Because my impulse is sharing, including, giving.  I still think of food as a gift.  I think of my writing and my restaurants as things I give.  May be self-aggrandizing, but that’s the way I think of it.\nAnd we had no money.  But I would put a blanket on the floor.  We had two rooms that opened out into each other, and I would put a blanket on the floor, and I had two burners.  So I would make pasta and a pasta sauce and a salad and a bottle of wine, and we would sit on the floor and eat.  And that I remember.\nWhen we went out—again, we had really no money.  I think we went maybe once or twice to the Chase, which was the big hotel then, still is, I think, on the park.  St. Louis had been very rich.  It had been the way up from the South.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nKafka:  I don’t know where I was.\n\nQ:  When you went out, you didn’t have any money either, so—\n\nKafka:  Right.  However, as I say, I was never color-conscious, or at least not negatively.  I wasn’t stupid.  The name of my favorite place was the Pig Meat Café.\n\nQ:  Sounds great.\n\nKafka:  I assure you I was the only white woman in the place.  And we went to Fred’s places, and we got a deal.  He would put the entertainers up on the fourth floor in another apartment.  So I met Greta Keller, who was the pre-Marlena Dietrich, an Austrian and still performed, that Fred had found.  He dug her up, practically literally.  I met Nichols and May, and then we had a connection because Severn Darden had been at a school in Massachusetts, and my husband had known people who were also sent to the school for difficult people, and so we knew Seve, who was brilliantly funny.\nThen my husband had saved up all his time for self-chosen courses, and we went off to London, and he went to Queens Square, which is the great neurological hospital.  His mother had multiple sclerosis, so it was somewhat over-determined.  She, incidentally, was a great baker—maybe that’s why I don’t bake—and she was a good cook and she was a pianist and all those things, but then could not do them.  But she did cook for her family until she became incapacitated.\nWe found an apartment, very cold.  London was still suffering the aftermath in 1958 of the war.  When we left London—no, I’d been to Europe before.  Not true.  I had been to Europe when I was sixteen with a girls’ group, and we went to Italy, I had Italian food, and then we went to Paris, and there I saw Jacques again, and I saw another fascinating group of people.  And then I went to Europe again.  When I went then, it was really a terrible time still in Paris, and I was in Paris when the Plâce de la Concorde was black.  There were no lights.  And I was there the night they turned on the Eiffel Tower lights.\n\nQ:  Oh, how thrilling.\n\nKafka:  And there was a bottle in lights on the side.  It was a Perrier bottle.  Perrier had paid for this in the ad.  L’eau qui vas Pschitt.  And that was extraordinary and exciting.\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, what were you seeing your own future as at that point?\n\nKafka:  To be a poet.  Then we went to England with that group, where it was very poor, and we went on a boat, a ferry, across to Holland, and I will never forget the breakfast buffet in the Holland station of the ferry, with a typical Dutch breakfast, ham, cheese, chocolate, nothing that you could get in England or France.  So they had recovered from the war much more quickly.\nYears later we went on our honeymoon in the summer, and we went on the boat, of course.  My father had been on the China Clipper for business going to France, and we went on the boat and we went to France, landed, and then we drove down through France, down into Spain, through Spain, where my husband got—\n\nQ:  Something.\n\nKafka:  Well, no, not just the trots, a really bad infection, and I thought he was going to die, brand-new husband.  And then he got better, found a doctor through the American consul.  I guess we were, I don’t know, Barcelona, someplace on the coast, and they gave me the name of a doctor who they said spoke English, which is what I’d asked for.  So I called, and he came to the hotel because my husband clearly could not go there, and the hotel was pretty much closed.  It was summer and nobody went to these hot hotels in those days.  And he didn’t speak English.  He had written papers with an English co-author.  Anyhow, he gave him Coca-Cola and he gave him some opium, which is what they had in those days, no Imodium.  But he needed it anyhow, and no antibiotics yet.  He got better, but he went raving out of his mind in the middle of the night with the opium and the fever and started speaking German in the voice of a child.\nSo then we drove across Europe, and we went to Vienna, which was his childhood home, and in Vienna we hadn’t made a hotel reservation, and he stopped at the only thing that looked like a hotel that was open.  When he told them, they said, sure, he could have a room, and then when he said he was going to go get his wife, they started to laugh, because it was a whorehouse.  And we finally found a hotel.  So Vienna was still poor.\nI had been to Europe my senior year, the year I graduated from college.  I had been going out with Ernie, and I had broken up with him, and I saw him briefly.\n\nQ:  Was he at Harvard when you were at Radcliffe?\n\nKafka:  Yes, that’s where we met. When we married, he was in medical school in St. Louis. Is final year we went to London. I then got a job, through my mother, working for the Encyclopedia Britannica, which was still then in London.  The dollar was very powerful in those days.  You have to remember how rich we were compared to the rest of the world.  So on all of these trips, I ate because it was cheap, and I didn’t live in places with kitchens.\n\nQ:  These trips took place in between school years?\n\nKafka:  When I was in high school, when I was in college, and then on my honeymoon, and then with Ernie in the last year of medical school.  When he was in medical school, we did have a kitchen, but none of those other times did I have a kitchen.  So we went out to eat, and one ate very well for very little money, and I continued [to be] a Francophile.\n\nQ:  And your standards for eating presumably had been set by the food that you ate at home as a child and by the restaurants that you were exposed to?\n\nKafka:  Yes, and by Ducky’s food.  He had French food in his house.  I mean, he didn’t make it, but he had a person, une dame qui a fait la cuisine.  And the Polaceks had very good food.  So, yes, I always had good food.  I mean, not always.  I went to school.\n\nQ:  Of course, I understand.  At what point did you realize that your interest was more than just—\n\nKafka:  I didn’t.\n\nQ:  You didn’t?  Okay.\n\nKafka:  I really didn’t.  When we returned from Europe, my husband did his internship and residency, and I got a job working at Mademoiselle.\n\nQ:  So you were here?\n\nKafka:  Yes, being a copy editor, and then I went to S & S as a copy editor.  And I never could spell, so I became a fabulous copy editor because I looked up everything.  But I worked for a woman at Mademoiselle who was a brilliant copy editor.  She then went on to be the copy editor of Scientific American, which was quite a job.  And it was a different world.  Rita Smith was the fiction editor, and her sister was a three-name woman who was crippled, from the South—it will come to me—and Cicely was the Features Editor—anyhow, Leo Lerman I met there.  Leo was terribly important to me, and he is the fulcrum that you’re looking for.  He was a contributing editor.  I used to work very late because I had nothing else to do, and he was working late one night.  He had a cubicle.  We had an office with a window because of Sally Jenks, and he called me into his cubicle.  I had edited some of his copy, very rococo writing.  This was the days of “dear” and “darling.”  He said, “Tell me, darling, you want to write, don’t you?”\n\tI said, “Yes, Mr. Lerman. Yes, yes.”\n\tAnd he said, “Well, I’ll send you to Allene Talmey at Vogue.”  Allene was the features editor at Vogue.\nAnd I said, “Oh, thank you.”\n\tAnd he looked at me and said, “And tell me, dear, what are you going to tell them that you write about?”\n\tAnd I thought, and I said, “Oh, Mr. Lerman, I will write about art.  All my friends are painters.”  I mean, this was, after all, the end of the fifties, and the beginning of the sixties, art was the most exciting thing happening in New York in those days.\n\tAnd he said, “No, darling, you’re not going to write about art for Vogue.”\n\tI said, “But Mr. Lerman, you told me.”\n\tAnd he said, “She writes about art for Vogue.  You’re not going to write about art for Vogue.”\nAnd I sort of metaphorically threw up my hands.  I had been in the habit of bringing in a pâté or a foodie gift, because, as I say, to me food was a gift.  And I said, “You tell me what I should write about.”\n\tAnd he said to me, “Tell her you write about food.  You cook divinely.”\n\nQ:  Interesting.\n\nKafka:  So I went off a few days later to see Ms. Talmey, who was a beast out of nature, if you read—what’s her name, the woman the ended up on the editorial page of the Times and wrote a piece about when we were young, a book, and she has a vivid portrait of Mrs. Talmey.  I went into her office.  I was really shaky.  She was my height, so that wasn’t the problem.  She distinguished herself by not wearing a hat in the office.  All the lady editors in those days wore hats to distinguish themselves from the peons who worked there, who, of course, were not paid very much.  They were supposed to be supported by their families, who were supposed to be of a caliber that Vogue would appreciate, which was not true at Mademoiselle.  Mademoiselle had the college competition in those days and so forth.\nAnd she said to me—she did not ask me to sit down—“Tell me, dear, if I let,”—you get the operative verb—“you write for Vogue, what would you write about?”\n\tWell, I had the answer to that.  I’d been primed.  I said, “Oh, Mrs. Talmey, I would write about food.”\n\t“And tell me, dear, if I let you write about food for Vogue, what would you write about?”  I hadn’t got a clue.  He didn’t tell me I had to have story ideas prepared.  But I was a quick study.  I’d studied comparative literature.  So I gave her two comp lit ideas.  One was about sweet and sour foods from different parts of the world, and one was about food wrapped in dough from different parts of the world, hence the strudel dough.\n\tAnd she said, “All right,” and she commissioned them.\n\nQ:  That was pretty creative of you to come up with those.\n\nKafka:  Well, that’s never been the problem.  Other inhibitions, but not that.\nSo I started to go, and I’m almost at the door, and she said to me, “I find it often helps to start with a quotation.”\n\tWell, I had never written a food piece.  I’d never written a recipe.  I had no idea where to begin.  Research I knew how to do.  So I went down to Fourth Avenue, which in those days had all the used bookstores, and I bought—you can still see them on the way out—compendiums of quotations.\n\nQ:  I see.  [laughs]\n\nKafka:  I knew how to do research.  So I did research on quotations.  About two months later, I got a call from Mrs. Talmey.  She said, “Tell me, dear, when am I going to get those articles?”\nWell, nothing concentrates the mind so well as a deadline.  I went into the kitchen.  I started cooking.  I’d eaten enough food in my life, and I have very good taste memory, and there were always books to read.  So I developed recipes, and then I had the good sense to read Vogue and see what they’re writing, having not known that she was the arts editor.  I knew enough to do the research to see how they wrote recipes in an article, and I wrote the article and I wrote the recipes.  And she published it, and she didn’t change a word.  Then, emboldened, I wrote the second piece, which was harder since, as I say, I am not a natural baker.  But I wasn’t doing sweet things anyhow.\n\nQ:  Now, this has been written about a little bit, saying that you wrote the first food piece with recipes for Vogue, but it doesn’t sound like—\n\nKafka:  No, no, no, no.  My first piece was—no.  Maxime McKendry, who was Loulou de la Falaise’s mother, was the food writer before me.\n\nQ:  At Vogue?\n\nKafka:  At Vogue.  And she was a very good cook, and it was her brother who owned Annabel’s and various other clubs and restaurants.  Mark Birley and her father was a bad painter and her first husband was a bad sculptor, and then she married McKendry, who was a curator at the Metropolitan Museum.  I don’t know whether she had a falling-out with Allene or what it was, but eventually she went back to Europe, and so they needed a food writer.\nSo Allene gave me these two articles and I wrote them at the same time. Leo was a contributing editor to Playbill, which was in the theaters in those days, and in those days it was weekly.  And so he got me a job, which paid bupkes, to review restaurants, which I did.  I lost money, as I do with most things, because I wouldn’t take comp meals, and this was deemed insane at the time.\n\nQ:  That was way ahead of your time, really.\n\nKafka:  Right.  I was deemed insane.\n\nQ:  Yes, that was great.\n\nKafka:  The PR people would call me and ask me to go.\n\nQ:  That was fantastic.\n\nKafka:  And I’d say, “I’ll come, but you can’t—” I didn’t even know the word “comp.”  “You can’t treat me to the meal.”  Unlike Clementine Paddleford, who was then reviewing restaurants and who used to go in this swaggering cape.  She was quite a character.  Did you read this biography of hers?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nKafka: Very good.  She would go into a restaurant where she might have even been the year before, and she would order, and everybody would pretend not to recognize her.  And at the end of the meal, she would get up and go like this and say, “I’m Clementine Paddleford and I want to see your kitchen.”  And, of course, there would be no check.\nI think Leo thought he was giving me a sinecure, that I would have all this food because we were still young, but I wouldn’t do it.\n\nQ:  Well, that was very smart and probably very unusual.\n\nKafka:  Well, I made a brief career about going around.  I forget, following a food writer for Food & Wine, going around after him and writing pieces that were not essentially paid for, and it was considered acceptable at the time.  Nobody paid for their own meals.  Gourmet may have paid for the meals, may have paid for the Chamberlains’ trip to France.  Narcisse, the daughter, who was an editor at Morrow—I think I would have known.  But that was much later.  I mean, I didn’t know about—that was during the Second World War that McAllister started Gourmet. \n\nQ:  So you were writing these pieces.\n\nKafka:  Every week.\n\nQ:  Every week?\n\nKafka:  Every week.  Three restaurants often—\n\nQ:  Every week for Vogue?\n\nKafka:  No, for Playbill.\n\nQ:  For Playbill, oh, I’m sorry.  Okay, every week for Playbill, okay.  Got it.\n\nKafka:  No, Vogue was recipe pieces at that point in time.\n\nQ:  These were restaurant reviews?\n\nKafka:  For Vogue?\n\nQ:  No, for Playbill.\n\nKafka:  Yes, it was restaurant reviews.  It was all restaurant reviews.  Yes, I was very inventive.  I did restaurants in—and I remember because it was certainly unheard of—in museums.\n\nQ:  Smart.\n\nKafka:  The Guggenheim had the best food, I remember that.\n\nQ:  And how did you see this work fitting into your life as a writer?\n\nKafka:  I’d been working as a copy editor.  It was better than working as a copy editor only.  It made some money.  I was still writing poetry.  As I say, when I was at Farrar Strauss, I used to go to John Farrar’s seminar, which was a group thing where everybody read their poetry and so forth.\nWe lived on 67th Street at that point between Lexington and 3rd, opposite the firehouse.  Actually, it was a wonderful building—it still is—130 East 67th, but in those days nobody wanted to live there because the firehouse was opposite.  There was a schul down the block on the same side, and the Russian Embassy has its people there.\n\nQ:  That’s quite a combination.\n\nKafka:  And there were all these policemen there, and, of course, the Armory was across the street.  But Lehman Brothers, the wine store before they sold to Sherry, was on Madison and 67th, and for my husband’s birthday I decided to go for broke and I went into Lehman to buy him a great bottle of wine, and I said, “I want to buy a wonderful bottle of wine.”\nAnd so the salesman called a young man up out of the cellar, and it was Bob Haas, Robert Haas, who was another great influence in my life, and I explained to him what I wanted and he presented me—well, he didn’t present, it was not a gift—with a 1952 La Tâche which I remember vividly was fifty dollars, and I was prepared to spend more.  And I said, “Is that the best?”  I didn’t know.\n\tAnd he said, “Unless you want to spend thousands on 1919,” which I’d already drunk in my time.  But we became friends.  His then-wife was interested in music, and we used to go to concerts together, and I began to know a good deal more about wine.  I had lost my stint at Vogue, which I’ll tell you about, but in any case, he’d gotten me a job being the editor of the American edition of Revue des Vins de France\n\nQ:  I was going to ask you what that was.\n\nKafka:  Well, Revue des Vins de France was a very important French wine journal, which at that point edited by a woman who had been the secretary to the man who started it, whose name is escaping me at the moment, who had been a wine salesman as [unclear] was and so forth, and had made some of the great wine lists of France.  When I was young, you could still see those wine lists.  Because of the war and one thing or another, the spines, they were still there.  So foreign wine I’d tasted, French wine and what have you.\nThen Bobby suggested to me that I do something about American wine, and I hadn’t heard of American wine.  But I think Frank Schoonmaker had already written that book; maybe not.  He’d certainly written German Wine, and German wine, I had written about, read, and written about, and drunk German wine.\n\nQ:  For?\n\nKafka:  For Revue des Vins de France.\n\nQ:  The French or American edition?\n\nKafka:  The American edition.\n\nQ:  What was the American edition?  \n\nKafka:  Translation plus articles commissioned here.  And since I was fluent in French, and so was Bobby, I could vet the translation and see what was appropriate and what was wrong, whether it was good,\n\nQ:  So was that a full-time job?\n\nKafka:  Nothing was a full-time job.\n\nQ:  Yes.  It sounds like it should have been a full-time job, yes.\n\nKafka:  No, I was doing that after—that was relatively late.  I’m skipping around in history.  I met Bobby in the fifties, but I think we were already living here in 1964 when I started editing IV.  And that was still very early for American wine.  And then I started—the Four Seasons had those wine tastings, those barrel tastings.  Bobby lived in Mamaroneck/Rye, but he used to give a party with me at my apartment, so I must still have been at 67th Street, but it was before I was editing.\n\nQ:  And this would have been approximately when?\n\nKafka:  1964, I moved in here.\n\nQ:  Here?\n\nKafka:  Here, and lived on 67th until that time.  But I’d been accumulating knowledge, the great capital.\n\nQ:  And still writing poetry, or no?\n\nKafka:  Still writing poetry.  I wrote poetry, and then I had children.\n\nQ:  That will do it, right.\n\nKafka:  I was very reluctant to have children for that reason.\n\nQ:  You knew it was going to impinge on your work time?\n\nKafka:  There’s an egotism required in poetry.\n\nQ:  Absolutely.\n\nKafka:  And you have to isolate yourself.  I had a lot of isolated time because of Ernie’s work, and then I wouldn’t have any, and one couldn’t be selfish in that way.  My mother had been selfish in that way, and I would not be.  That was one of the things I would not do.  But in any case, I continued dicking around with food stuff.\n\nQ:  Meaning what?  Writing, you mean, or what?\n\nKafka:  Yes.  And when I had our daughter, I used to go to Central Park, right?  And I met a park mother.  In the meantime, I had an idea for a cookbook, a very good idea—it’s still a good idea—and I went to see—maybe Leo sent me—the man who owned Dial and Dell, and gave him this idea and he bought it.\n\nQ:  And what was that?\n\nKafka:  It was an idea to start with three kitchen implements, in this case, a sauté pan, a wooden spoon, and a peppermill.  Those were my choice of the first three.  And then to describe how you should buy them, what they were, and give three recipes for using them, and by the end of the book you have a basically equipped kitchen, a basic compendium of recipes, and then there would be more recipes in back that would be keyed to the place in the book where you could presumably do them, where you had the technique.  So three items, three techniques, and three recipes.  And I don’t think I knew enough.\nBut in any case, in the park I met Charlotte Sheedy, who’s now a literary agent, I think she still is, and we were both wheeling children.  Her daughter was Ali Sheedy, the actress.  Charlotte had worked for the president of Dial Dell.  So one day, she came to me, and she said, “There’s a job.”  Because the kids were somewhat bigger; they were in kindergarten or what have you, whatever, at least half a day and probably Nicole a whole day already.  She said, “It’s one you might like to do.”\nBy that time, she was living on Central Park West instead of on East 96th Street, and it turned out that her downstairs upstairs neighbor was Burt Wolf, and he had had the idea, which he’d sold.  He was a con artist—still is—of the first order.  He had sold this idea for The Cooks’ Catalogue, and he described it to me and told me it had been sold and asked me if I—we are approaching Jim Beard—\n\nQ:  I realize that.  [laughs]\n\nKafka:  He asked me if I would like to edit it.  Charlotte had thought I could do it, because this idea for this book was about equipment, and still I had no fear of new activities in those days.  But I wasn’t sure I wanted to leave home yet, so I asked for more money than I thought I could ever get, which was five hundred dollars a week.\n\nQ:  When you say you weren’t sure that you wanted to leave home, meaning on a daily basis?\n\nKafka:  For the children, yes.  No, I wasn’t Emily Dickinson.  But it was when I found myself standing inside that door there waiting for the children to come home, that I decided it was not a healthy relationship.\nSo I got my five hundred dollars a week, and I went to work for Beard Glaser Wolf.  I was taken down on my first day, or my second day, to meet Mr. Beard, to be vetted.  He was already living on 12th Street, but he had his office in those days on the ground floor, and there was no spiral staircase as there is today.  You had to go up the outside public staircase.  He had two floors, Gino had a floor, and he had tenants on the fourth floor.\nHe sat me down and we began talking, and he was charming as he could be and extremely intelligent.  That’s what nobody remembers to say about Jim, which is very important, is the level of intelligence.  Not just the memory, but the intelligent memory, the ability to understand, to codify, to make connections.  We began a conversation, it was very nice, and he said, “Well, what did you cook yesterday?”  And I told him I’d made a pâté, and he asked what kind of fat I’d used.  And I told him I’d used kidney fat, and he got furious.  He said, “You can’t use kidney fat.  It breaks.”  I mean, he was a huge man with a fierce temper.\n\tAnd I said, “But, Mr. Beard, I did.  If you put it between two sheets of wax paper and roll it.”  And he got up and stormed, with these great huge boat-like feet, out into the hall and shouted at Burt, “I can’t work with her.  I can’t work with this woman.”  I did not know then that the prior editor of this project had been José Wilson, and José had been the English woman who did Beard’s writing at that point.  If you read Beard, you’ll realize that nobody really did his writing, that he did tapes or he did interviews, and the voice is always his own no matter, who wrote it, putatively.\nJackie Mallorca, who has a book that just came out, was another English woman who was living in California after José disappeared from the scene. Alcoholic.  There was a lot of alcoholism in publishing in those days.  She had been the editor of House and Garden.  He got me a gig, because I was still freelancing, writing an article for House and Garden.  They had those cookbook inserts.\nIn any case, he got halfway up the stairs, I’m putting on my coat like this, Burt is there, and I hear him turn around, and he comes down, the only time I’ve ever heard him apologize.  He said, “I’m sorry.  I’ve been in a foul mood all day.”\n\tAnd we became—I can’t say we were friends; we were a cohort.  He took me out to teach with him in California.  I never asked him what he was going to pay me.  After expenses, he split the take half and half, and continued to do that.  I never asked him about money, and he was always fair with me.  He came a few times to dinner.  We would go out to lunch a lot, because he was writing reviews, and besides which, he never paid for anything.  So we would go to the Coach House or someplace else, the Four Seasons, where he was known.\nWhen I was editing Revue des Vins de France, which was earlier, Bob suggested that I interview Joe Baum.  You see how the people were so important to me?  He said, “He has a wonderful wine cellar.”  In those days, he was still at R. A.  So I did an interview with Mr. Baum, also at the Coach House, which had a very good wine cellar.  Leon had a marvelous wine cellar, probably the first with American wines as well.  Joe, because of the Four Seasons, was very interested in American things, native produce, native recipes, grew herbs on the roof of the Four Seasons, the Seagram Building, had John Cage out picking wild mushrooms, had a terrific fight with John Cage because John Cage wanted to be paid differentially by the rarity of the mushroom.\n\nQ:  Oh, my god.\n\nKafka:  And Joe said he couldn’t do that because it was—in any case, I mean, those were the days when most of the things we think of were not in stores, or many of the things.  Other things were that were better than today.  The pork, all this brouhaha now about these fat pigs from—I remember when all pork was fat and it was cheap.  Then they decided to turn it into “the other white meat.”\nIn any case, so I did an interview with Joe, and then I didn’t see him again till Beard Glaser Wolf, where he was a consultant.  And then I had a fight with Burt after I’d really written the book.  I mean, I hired people, but I insisted on paying for-- the same goddamned thing again--for the equipment or sending it back.  And Burt, after a while, didn’t have the money.  I mean, he was really a thief in many ways.  That’s another whole long story.  He wasn’t paying the suppliers.\n\nQ:  A common flaw.\n\nKafka:  So I quit.  Jim was very sympathetic, and he sent me to see Joe and to see George Lang, both of whom were restaurant consultants, and they both offered me jobs.  Joe was already down at the Trade Center, but Windows hadn’t been built, and he hired me to buy china, glass and silver tabletop—return to my father—not because he knew that, but he thought I could do it because I’d just been editing this book which was all about equipment and buying and so forth.\n\nQ:  So when he hired you to do that, the china, the glass for the tables, would that have been your first foray into real restaurant consulting?\n\nKafka:  Any restaurant consulting.\n\nQ:  Well, that’s what I meant, that technically that was—\n\nKafka:  Right.  I always did everything as a freelancer, and I’d had one other freelance—two.  One was at something Friedman down on Union Square, which was the big restaurant supply house, developing a cooking school for them.  And then I hired Jim to teach there.  No, I did not.  We gave a party for Jim’s birthday in the space.\n\nQ:  Where was that space?\n\nKafka:  Union Square.  H. Friedman, I think it was.  I don’t remember the name.\n\nQ:  It was like a storefront or something?\n\nKafka:  Well, it had a storefront, but that’s not what it was.  It was a wholesale restaurant supply house, pots and pans, china, glass, and silver, so on and so forth.  I had met them because of The Cooks’ Catalogue.  I also met Carl Sontheimer at that time, and I was doing Beard Glaser Wolf, who had just imported the Cuisinart, which I put on the cover of The Cooks’ Catalogue along with other things, obviously.\n\nQ:  Now, that’s described as your having edited it, but it sounds like you wrote it.\n\nKafka:  I wrote it.  I did edit it.  I had writers.  I hired Irene Sax, who you know, and you can ask her.  I’m not making this up.  She was the wife of another analyst.  We went out to lunch when she told me she’d been co-authoring this book about table settings or what have you, and she was very down in the dumps, and I said, “Come work for me.”  Well, you have to have a feel for people, and she did, and she was wonderful.  She has no writer’s block.  She’s the only writer I’ve ever met—\n\nQ:  It’s incredible.\n\nKafka:  —who has no writer’s block.  She sits down and she does it.\n\nQ:  So she came to work for you as—\n\nKafka:  At Beard Glaser Wolf.  I would show her a piece of equipment that I had selected, found, somehow selected, because the first thing was to get the catalogues in and everything and read all of them.  I mean, I’m a compulsive to do it all.  And then when I selected it and had it sent in, then I’d choose among the variants, then Renie would—I would tell her what it was and why it was good, and then she would write the actual copy.  Flo Fab worked for me on one section and later claimed that she wrote the book and edited the book, which she didn’t, and then she worked with Burt on the update, and I’m happy to tell you it was a total failure.\n\nQ:  Where were the original offices where you put out The Cooks’—\n\nKafka:  In the East Fifties between 2nd and 3rd someplace.\n\nQ:  Did equipment get sent into you?\n\nKafka:  Yes, it was a great big loft space.\n\nQ:  And could you describe, for the purposes of here, what the purpose of The Cooks’ Catalogue was?\n\nKafka:  Well, just as ingredients were scarce on the ground in those days, it was the period of graniteware.  Do you know what graniteware is?\n\nQ:  I don’t think I know.\n\nKafka:  It’s the enamel pots that are thin and brown and white, blue and white, or black and white, stippled on thin metal.\n\nQ:  I didn’t know that was granitewear.\n\nKafka:  Your grandmother’s roasting pan, which was terrible stuff because the enamel chipped and bugs could be harvested and there was no diffusion.\nOn my honeymoon with this brand-new husband in 1955, we went to the puces, the flea market, and I bought—I mean, I’ve always been a nut, I bought a complete batterie de cuisine for seventy-five dollars, all copper.\n\nQ:  How did you get it back here?  Oh, my god.\n\nKafka:  My husband drove it all through Europe in the back of a quatre-chevaux.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nKafka:  And then we came back on a boat, so it was no problem.  I’ll show it to you.  I still have it; don’t use it for testing.\n\nQ:  But it’s great to have it.  That’s wonderful.\n\nKafka:  No, I use it for cooking.  But I don’t use it for testing, because it cooks so differently, and that’s not fair to people.  So there was always this leitmotif, if you want.\nSo then I went to work for Joe, and Joe had always worked with Jim.  He worked with him at the Four Seasons, and he hired him to work on Windows.  Jim really didn’t do much at Windows, but he—\n\nQ:  When you went to work for Joe, Joe’s business at that point was restaurant—\n\nKafka:  No, no, no, no.  He had been president of Restaurant Associates and—no, he’d been—and the chairman had been Jerry Brody.  Jerry Brody was married to the daughter of Abe Wexler, who owned a coffee company, which owned various inexpensive restaurants.  And Jerry started this Restaurant Division, and he hired Joe, who was in Miami running a hotel restaurant, to come up and do the Newarker in the Newark airport.  Jerry was really the business partner, and Joe was always the creative partner.  He managed a feat of no mean—he turned it into a successful restaurant that people wanted to go to.\nThen at one point, Jerry started branching out to Europe, and he opened a place in  Divonne-les-Bains, in a gambling place.  They had an office in Paris, and he began having an affair with the secretary there.  He went into Mr. Wexler’s office one day, and he said, “I just want you to know I’m going to ask your daughter for a divorce, but, of course, I’ll continue to work for you.”\nWell, he had no idea about Jewish fathers.  Mr. Wexler said to him, “You will not continue working for me.  Out!”\n\tSo he and Marlene were out of jobs.  But he’d put away quite a lot of money, and then he did the place in what was then the GM Building and so on and so forth.\nBut that left Joe in charge.  But Joe had been the creative director, really, of R. A.  He did the Forum of the Twelve Caesars, and he did the Four Seasons, and he did Zum Zum.  His parents owned a hotel with a restaurant in Saratoga.\n\nQ:  Oh, I didn’t know that.\n\nKafka:  Oh yes.  I wrote about him someplace.  And then David Schine hired him for Schine Hotels.  At some point before he went to Miami, he went to the Lexington, which was on Lexington Avenue, still there in some form.  It was later, I think, he got Jerry to buy it.  I may be confusing time here.\nIn any case, he put in the Hawaiian Room and developed the Pu Pu Platter, and he had a slide down which you could go and slide, because it was in a basement space, and all that fusion food, he started.  I mean, Joe was an incredible genius about—he did much of the stuff at the World’s Fair and so on.\n\n[End of interview] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKafka – 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Barbara Kafka\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #2\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t                                  New York City\n\nDate:  April 6, 2009\n\nQ:  It’s April 6, 2009, and it’s Judith Weinraub.  I’m with Barbara Kafka.  This is our second interview session.\n\tGood morning.  How are you?\n\nKafka:  Good morning.\n\nQ:  I thought we could talk about James Beard, how your relationship developed with him from the time that you met him and going on after that.  So if you could just review how you did meet him and your work with him on The Cooks’ Catalogue progressed.\n\nKafka:  I met him through The Cooks’ Catalogue where I had the job of making The Cooks’ Catalogue.  He was a titular author, which always embarrassed him because he did no authorship on it whatsoever, not even dictation or suggestions.  There was a board of consultants, among them were George Lane and Joe Baum, and they, in fact, were helpful with input because of the professional equipment and wide acquaintance with the field.\n\tI was taken down to meet Mr. Beard at his townhouse on 12th Street by Burt Wolf, who was the organizer and entrepreneur of the project.\n\n\nQ:  You were telling me about Burt Wolf.\n\nKafka:  He was the entrepreneur and put-er-together of the project.\n\nQ:  What was the idea of it?\n\nKafka:  The idea of it was to have a catalogue of all the best light equipment, i.e., not stoves, refrigerators, and heavy equipment, but light equipment in the kitchen.  It turned out to be extremely influential because it was the start of the cooking boom, and all of the nascent cooking schools and cooking shops, cookware shops took it up as a bible and used it.  That’s what it accomplished and that’s what it set out to do.  It was heavily illustrated.\n\tMilton Glaser, who was one of the principals, did actually do a lot of work because it was his company that put the visuals together and made it into a book.  As I said, Mr. Beard wasn’t involved.  He had been involved originally because his friend and sometimes previously assistant, José Wilson, he placed in the editorial position for the catalogue.  That didn’t work out, and I was brought in.  So I was taken in to see Mr. Beard, and we had a terrific fight, but we managed to reconcile it and became friends.\n\nQ:  At the panel at The New School, you talked about that fight a little bit.  I wonder if you could just recount it again.\n\nKafka:  I think I did here, too.  I went to see him in his townhouse on 12th Street.  In those days, the office was upstairs on the upper of the two floors that he occupied.  There was no spiral staircase, which there was later, connecting the apartment and the downstairs together.  We met in the downstairs area, which was where he used to have students eat the food that they made.  We talked agreeably enough, seemed to have similar frames of reference, and he asked me what I had been cooking.  I said I had made a pâté the night before, and I rashly included the information that I had used kidney fat to line the pan.\n\tAnd he said, “You can’t use kidney fat.”\n\tAnd I said, “But, Mr. Beard, I did use kidney fat.  If you cut it and you put it between two sheets of wax paper.”\n\tHe said to Burt, “I can’t talk to this woman.  She doesn’t know anything,” got up, and these great enormous feet, great enormous man, stormed out into the hall to go up the stairs.\n\tAnd, shaking, I put on my coat and heard him clomping up the stairs.  Just as I got to the hall when he was halfway up, he turned around and came down, and he said, “I’m sorry.  I’m in a perfectly foul mood today.”  And after that, we were able to talk.  But he did have a fierce temper.  So I never had it directed at me again, but it was a fierce temper.\n\tAt that time, he was extremely busy.  He wrote a syndicated column for newspapers, which was extremely influential in the sense that there were none of the television outlets at that point that there are today, and even when they came online, they were not frequent, and they were epiphenomenona.  So newspapers, magazines were the primary mode of disseminating culinary or whatever information about food.\n\tHe had a very talk-comfortable, listener-available style.  He did always, as far as I know, or for most of his life, have somebody, some one woman, who worked with him, turning the material into printable prose.  However, if one reads him in the books and in the columns, one sees that the voice is unmistakable.  Later, he used tape and he would dictate to the tape, and then whoever the writer was—after José, it was Jackie Mallorca, on The Pasta Book it was Irene Sax, and then finally, at the end, Richard, his assistant, took over for a brief period of time.  But by that time, the column was winding down.  But it let him introduce the names of important chefs and restaurants that he frequented, often off the cuff, to the readership.  So he was important to the industry and important to the reader.\n\nQ:  And he was doing that while the rest of you were working on The Cooks’ Catalogue?\n\nKafka:  Yes, but I was not involved in the columns.  He had written several books by that time, quite a few.  I had actually read one of them somewhat—two.  When I went to Dell Dial, I got a copy of the James Beard Cookbook, and people forget, but it was another bible for the home cook.  And then I bought, actually bought, the Fireside Cookbook, and that, to me, is a brilliant book.  It’s been reissued recently, and it is a model of intelligence where a master recipe is given and explained in fairly good detail and then variations are given that may be regional, that may be personal, but it’s very usable and very good and very logical.  I think I said to you, Mr. Beard not only had a fabulous memory, but he was extremely intelligent, and he really could organize the material in his head and use it.\n\nQ:  Even though he wasn’t working on The Cooks’ Catalogue, did your relationship with him develop in that period of time?\n\nKafka:  It began to, yes.  He gave cooking classes in his kitchen, and he was going out of town, but he had organized a cooking class with the then important editors, food editors or personas.\n\nQ:  In New York?\n\nKafka:  In New York.  Oh yes.  This was not yet a multi-city discipline.  He asked five different people to give a course, one-day course, and I gave a one-day cooking lesson.  Clay, his longtime houseman who now works with the Beard Foundation, was there.  I decided to do a bouillabaisse because it’s great fun and it’s a lot of things that you can say about it in making the rouille and blah, blah, blah, and because doing The Cooks’ Catalogue, I had come across the food processor, and I knew that you could do the rouille, the mayonnaise, in the food processor.\n\tSo I had the wit to check, because he had these strange Corning burners.  He did a lot of advertising work for companies, and Corning was one of his clients.  And I must say he was loyal in the sense that he used this stuff that he talked about using, and I knew that these were rather strange electric burners.  I’d never used them.  So I went down and tested by seeing if the olive oil in the bottom of the pan would get really hot.  Well, it did.  But what I didn’t realize in my ignorance was that the temperature was controlled by the contact, so it was very hard to get anything to boil at the top, especially a large pot of stuff, which is very hard with a bouillabaisse which is boiling from the base.\nSo I was doing this class and had a mortifying experience, and when I finally went to look for the white wine, to put it in, it was all gone because these women had, behind my back, been drinking the white wine for the cooking.  Clay, fortunately, bailed me out that far.  He went and got another bottle of wine.  Then, of course, when I made the rouille, it broke, and I had to remake it.  It was not one of the better evenings in my life.\n\tThe next day, I repeated the course for regular people, for I guess what you would call in those days housewives, and it went perfectly.  So you can learn, you can adjust, but heaven help you.\n\nQ:  What was the idea of giving, setting up, classes for those editors?\n\nKafka:  I don’t know.  Jim was maybe giving us exposure.  I’m not sure he wanted to do the classes himself for those people who were very critical.  I can’t tell you what was in his head.  It certainly kept the income stream going while he was away.  He was always worried about money.\n\nQ:  When you say he was away, meaning he was traveling?\n\nKafka:  He was away, he was traveling.  I don’t know where.  And Burt, who is something of a bitch, said, “Oh, give Jim $5,000, he’ll do anything,” which was not quite true and certainly unnecessary about a partner of his, and he was explaining to me also how important Mr. Beard was to the project because of his name.\n\tAnd I said, “Well, Burt, what will you do, he’s old, if something happens to him?”\n\tAnd Burt said, “Well, I’ll put on my James Beard fat suit.”  So, you know, he was that kind of person.  I don’t know.\n\tI don’t know, we gradually became friendlier.  It was always a professional friendship.  I mean, I knew Gino, who was his friend, because Gino lived there upstairs in his own apartment.  Gino had been an architect when Jim met up with him, and then he had given up and became a dependent, and Jim really didn’t tolerate dependency in that sense very well, which is why he found so many people jobs, because he didn’t want them to depend upon him.  So Gino then, who was a very good baker, made cakes for Alfredo Viazzi, who had a restaurant nearby in the Village called Alfredo.  He was an interesting character.\nAt some point, I don’t know when, we began to occasionally have lunch, and we would go to Alfredo’s or we would go to the Four Seasons, where he had a special relationship.  He’d been a consultant to the Four Seasons when it was opening.\n\tMr. Baum, who was equally loyal and decent, kept using him, even to the point where I was working on Windows on the World and Jim really wasn’t up to being in the house as a consultant, but he wrote Joe a few long letters, and they seemed to inspire Joe.  But it was Joe’s way of paying back, being there.  Joe was also always interested in learning, as was Jim, which I think it a great connecting thing between Joe and Jim and I.  Things were not taken for granted.  We examined them all and tried to learn more about them.\n\tWhen I left The Cooks’ Catalogue because they wouldn’t pay the suppliers—\n\nQ:  Good reason.\n\nKafka:  I gave you that the last time, they wouldn’t pay the suppliers.  Didn’t matter to Burt at all, he was perfectly happy, and he had a sale when the book was finished.  He had a sale and—\n\nQ:  Of the equipment?\n\nKafka:  Of all the stuff.  Took what he wanted and still didn’t pay the suppliers.  After I left, he brought in another editor to finish things up.  I had, by that time, completed all the prose and had all the prose written, and the photographs were organized.  She was very good and—\n\nQ:  Who was that?\n\nKafka:  I can’t remember the name.  It’s in the first edition of the book.  I can look for you.\n\nQ:  So how long period of time were you working on that book?\n\nKafka:  Three or four years, something.  My projects always seem to take about three, four years.\n\tBut as I said, I had met Joe Baum first through Bob Haas when I was doing Revue des Vins de France and then at The Cooks’ Catalogue, you know, briefly in passing, and I had met George Lang there also.  I needed a job, and I called them and had interviews and, fortunately, for me, although they both made me offers, I went with Joe, and that was one of the great learning experiences of my life, and pleasures.\n\nQ:  Could you talk a little bit about him?\n\nKafka:  Yes.  Let finish up Jim first.\nBy the time I was working with Joe, I then had another link with Jim through this.  One day I was working down at the Trade Center, of late lamented memory, and Jim called me and he said, “Barbara, you’d better get up here.”\n\tSo I dashed out the door, telling Joe that Jim had called and he seemed frantic, and I took a taxi up West Street and went over to his house.  I thought he was dying.  I thought he’d had a heart attack.  I mean, a man like that, it was not an improbability.  I went in, and he was perfectly fit, took me upstairs, we sat down, and he said, “I had better show you this.”  And he showed me the first copy of The Cooks’ Catalogue.  Under my agreement with Burt, I was supposed to be listed as the author, and neither of us, the two editors, had title page credit.  By the time the second printing came out, and it was very successful, Helen something, we’re both listed as editors.  But Jim was thoroughly on my side.  He was outraged, and very supportive at that point.\n\tThen later, he was going out to California, where he had organized cooking classes for him to give at the Stanford Court where he stayed in the reign of Jimmy Nassikas, another wonderful person.  He asked me to teach with him, and I went out.  I did not make any financial demands or arrangement, and, unlike everybody else I know, he was absolutely correct, honest, and generous.  He paid me for the class I had given with him, without him, and he split the take with me 50-50 in California after expenses were paid.  Expenses were fairly moderate because Chuck [Williams] supplied the equipment and Jimmy supplied most of the food.  It was not outrageous, because I was really doing a great deal of the teaching.\n\tBut Mr. Beard had a great strength of personality, and everybody thought that they had had a class with Mr. Beard, and that was true to the end of his life when he could do nothing but sit on a high director’s chair and sort of oversee things, and Richard, Richard Alleman, did the Barbara Kafka job.  There, at those California classes, I ran into Marion Cunningham.\n\nQ:  At the Stanford Court classes?\n\nKafka:  Yes.  She had taken class with him in California, and she’d taken classes with him in Oregon at the seashore.  She didn’t pay for the classes, these classes at the Stanford Court, but she was a handmaiden.  She even came and bandaged his legs, which were terrible, because he had clotication, and if you weighed that much weight, you’d probably have clotication, too.  And she hated me.\n\nQ:  How startling.  I mean, that must have been very difficult to deal with.\n\nKafka:  Well, I didn’t know how much she hated me.  She looked like a typical American lady with her gray hair and whatever.  I did not know that she was a recovering alcoholic, and she was what a friend of mine, who is in AA, calls a dry drunk.  She had the very difficult character, and one can see it in Judith and Evan Jones’ book on Jim, because there’s material on the California classes, which is on the edge of scurrilous about me, and it could only have come from Marion.  So one knows, you know.\n\nQ:  Did you deal with it?  Did you confront her with it at all?\n\nKafka:  Oh no.  I’m not confrontational, by and large.  Maybe more now, but not with people that I don’t really know.  I was not there for ambition, really.  Certainly the money was nice.  I learned a lot.  I got to know California, part of California which I had not known before.  But I don’t know what would have been accomplished.\n\tShe was a good baker, which shows up in her thing of Fannie Farmer, so Jim would sort of give her the baking to do.  And he was rather mischievous and in a not necessarily nice way.  He’d say, “Marion, I think we should do a tomato bread based on—why don’t you do that with them?”  Of course she didn’t know how.  She was not an inventive cook.  She managed, she bumbled through, but it was mischievous on his part.\n\tShe obviously found out I was being paid, and this enraged her, obviously, understandably.  So it was a complicated time.  I taught there for several years.\n\nQ:  What was the format of the classes?\n\nKafka:  We taught in Forno’s Oven, which was a restaurant in the basement of the Stanford Court, and it was Forno’s Oven.  Forno’s is a play on word.  There was a great big like pizza oven in the corner, and you could do a lot of things in it.  I mean, those ovens get very hot.  They’re very good for cooking meat very quickly and bread, and you can you use them as a tandoor or what have you.  But it didn’t make Marion’s life any easier.\nMr. Beard would start the class by talking a little about the recipes we were going to do, which I knew about, and then the students would divide up into groups, and different groups would make different recipes.  They could look and see and so forth.  Then at the end, there were questions, and I would circulate around, correcting and telling.\n\tAt one point, I did what I did every class after that that I did with Jim, was ask him to knead bread, because it was quite a thing to see.  He had huge hands and he would pick up the dough, slam it down, fold it over, and push it away from him with one hand.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nKafka:  Then he would turn the dough a quarter turn and do the same thing again.  And it was riveting.  The students, of course, were amazed.\n\tAnd I met people who became friends, and it was interesting.  Danny Kaye came to the class.  Danny was fascinated by cooking and very involved.  As he said to me, he wanted to see what the new cooker in town was doing, that being me, because a little rumble had started going out, and because a friend of mine, about whom I cared deeply, Barbara Tropp, younger than I but now dead, unfortunately, of ovarian cancer, had moved to California, and she had known Danny.  She had known Danny, and I think Danny—and also I had, I think in the litany of things I edited, I did not include the magazine that I started for the Cuisinart for Carl Sondheimer, which, again, transpired after I left Beard Glaser Wolf, and we had become somewhat friendly over my support for the food processor.  He was another brilliant man.  He could be quite difficult, but he was absolutely brilliant, fluent in French, which one would expect.\n\tBarbara, on the other hand, spoke Mandarin.  She was doing her doctorate on the poetry of the Sung when she went off to China, to Taiwan, actually, to live with a family and learn more Chinese.  And the man of the house was a fabulous cook, and she learned to cook Chinese food from him, and then she came back to Princeton, ostensibly to finish her degree, but she became more involved in cooking, gave some classes, wrote Carl Sontheimer a letter, and he put her on to me as the editor, and she and I became very close friends.  My last book, I think, is dedicated to her.\n\nQ:  I saw that, yes.\n\nKafka:  But she knew Danny, and so, in other words, the food world, at a certain level at that time, was still a rather small world by comparison with today where you have all these people who appear on television and who almost nobody knows in the business.\n\tThen you have this burgeoning of restaurants all over the country, and you have the groups like AIWF [American Institute of Wine & Food] and the James Beard Foundation that support chefs and promulgate them, and so that world had not existed.  People at a certain level like Jim and Joe all knew each other, and Jimmy, but it was less—\n\nQ:  Well, the people who came to the classes then, were they—\n\nKafka:  They were people.\n\nQ:  They were just ordinary people?\n\nKafka:  Well, I don’t know how ordinary.  In other words, Jim could be something of a snob.  He saw himself—his mother was English.  I don’t think she was upper class.  But he saw himself as something of an upper-class person.  And in San Francisco, he was.  He was very courted.  He would go to dinner, the Levi Strauss people, and all kinds of people, and all the high Episcopalians who belonged to the club that was at the top of the hill that Standford Court was on.  So that was a different thing.  So the Boeing girls were in the class, people like that.\n\nQ:  It wasn’t advertised?  It was an invitational class?\n\nKafka:  I think maybe cards and letters went out.  People would tend to take the course year after year.  They enjoyed it.\n\nQ:  It was a series, or what?\n\nKafka:  Yes, five days, weekdays.\nAnd then Jim and I became somewhat closer.  First of all, he had a suite and I had a little room.  It wasn’t that bad.  I’m not trying to knock it.  That was basically attached to his room.  I had my own bath.  But Jim was always a very early riser, at something like six o’clock in the morning, which is not my best hour of the day, particularly in California.  He would knock on my door, and we would have breakfast sent up.  And I’m not a breakfast person, although he was.  He loved breakfast, and we would begin the day.\n\tI also met Jeremiah Tower.  Jim collected attractive homosexuals.  He was obviously homosexual himself, but he did not have lots of affairs.  But he did love the gossip and the world.  Clark Wolf, who was running a shop at that point in San Francisco, was one.  Jeremiah was certainly the most glamorous of them, very good-looking.\n\tThat was another instance of Marion.  She became very negative about Jeremiah, because Jeremiah and Alice Waters had a falling-out.  Alice had started the restaurant, but she was basically a home cook.  She always wanted to hire people, and she had a great talent for finding people.  Alice Medrich was one of hers.  The women who did her flowers were fantastic.  She really had a talent for this.\n\tBut Jeremiah basically walked in the door and asked for a job.  He was trained as an architect.  What led him to this, I don’t know.  Someday I’ll ask him.  I still see him.  And he became the chef, and it was his cooking that made the reputation of the restaurant, and Alice couldn’t tolerate that.  Marion became friendly with Alice, and there was a third one, sort of the witches over the cauldron, was Cecilia Chang, who had a Chinese restaurant, I think the Mandarin in San Francisco, and who was quite a broad also.  She’d been married to a general.  As far as I can tell, all the great cooking people, the Chinese people, had all been married to generals.  Irene Kuo has been married to a general, or at least they said so.  Mrs. Ma, I mean, you know, Pearl of Pearl’s Restaurant here in New York, certainly an influential restaurant.\nAnd Jim had a firm belief—he liked Cecilia, and I got to meet her through him.  But he had a firm belief that only Chinese people could cook Chinese food.  He never cooked Chinese food.  We never did it in a class, and we didn’t even really use Chinese ingredients, which were available to a certain extent even then in San Francisco.  And the reason, I think, was when he was growing up, his mother, who had run a hotel and a hotel dining room, the chef, Jue Let, two words, who was the chef at the restaurant or the sous chef at the restaurant, became their personal chef at their house.  So Jim ate a great deal of this food.  And his father eventually left his mother for a woman in Chinatown, and he had been taken down there frequently.  So he was comfortable with Chinese people, but he just thought it was their thing and not his thing, which was, I thought, fascinating.\n\tWe used to go to a restaurant called Le Central, which was a small restaurant that did very traditional French bistro food, blood sausages and things like that that we both craved after our classes, and so, of course, eating three meals a day together, except when he went out with fancy people.\n\tBut he moved his people around.  Denise, whatever, Hale, who is married to the scion of Broadway Hale in shops, was a friend, an acquaintance of his.  Friend is an odd word in connection with Jim, though.\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nKafka:  I don’t think we were ever friends.  We were friendly.  It would never have occurred to me to talk about my personal life with Jim, and I knew about his personal life because of all these people that I met, and he would talk some about his personal life.  He would talk about his friend, and, as somebody said to me, “nobody has ever paid as much for a youthful indiscretion as Jim.”  He would talk about having wanted to be an opera singer.  I guess he didn’t have much of a personal life, in my sense of the word.  And certainly children were not a usable subject.  And I had this other life.\n\nQ:  What interests me is that in the things I’ve read about him, you’re often referred to as a friend or a frequent telephone friend and a frequent person at his lunches and dinners in New York.\n\nKafka:  Oh, it’s true.  I think that within his limits of caring, he cared about me, and even though I wasn’t an English woman and even though I wasn’t a gay male.  But we had a relationship.  It was a good, sound relationship, and I don’t think he had too many of those.  He had the people in the restaurant like Leon Leonidas, and we’d go there for lunch.  He had Joe [Baum], who he almost never saw.  Judith certainly was not a friend.\n\tWhen we started, were going to, Peter Kump had the idea of starting the Beard Foundation and making it a public thing, and he got together a meeting.  We were at 21 in a private room, not because of Peter, but because of Jim, although Jim was now dead.  It was somewhat problematic because Jim could have done with his money anything he wanted, and he could have started a school.  He had talked at one point to me about a supra school.  He was very interested in school.  The fact that the Foundation doesn’t have a school is, I think, a limitation, and when it started, I thought we were going to.\n\nQ:  What did he have in mind for the kind—\n\nKafka:  He wanted history classes, a school, public demonstrations, all of what there is, but more.  But he didn’t do it, and I think it was beyond his energy level.\n\tBut at any case, we were seated at this meeting at 21, everybody who’d been, quote, “friends” of his, and so we agreed to do what we could do.  Peter was raising the money, and he turned to Judith and said, “Of course, this is important to you because it will help keep Jim’s books alive.”\n\tAnd she said—and I quote—“I don’t care if they all go out of print.”\n\nQ:  My goodness.\n\nKafka:  Of course, now she doesn’t have that reaction, as you heard the other night [at Andy Smith’s panel at the New School on James Beard].\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nKafka:  So, yes, I’m a bitch.  I remember when Judith and Evan’s book was going to come out, I was finishing up The James Beard Celebration book, which I did pro bono for the James Beard Foundation, and that was my financial contribution, and not a mean one, I should add.  I pushed Morrow to come out with it in the spring, because I was damned if Judith and Evan—I liked Evan, incidentally—that Judith and Evan were going to cut me off at the pass.  And it came out that spring.\n\nQ:  Good for you.\n\nKafka:  Well, I mean—\n\nQ:  Absolutely.\n\nKafka:  —if people are going to start with me and make war—\n\nQ:  You’re up to it.\n\nKafka:  —I may not confront them, but I’m certainly going to try and take care of myself.\n\nQ:  Let me take you back for a second.  You mentioned that Mr. Beard usually had a woman, often an English woman, to help him with the books.\n\nKafka:  Not with books.  Well, with books, too, yes.\n\nQ:  Well, talk a little about that and what you think that was about.\n\nKafka:  His mother was English.  His mother was very strong.  He went into food because he could not make it in the theater or as an opera singer.  But, for instance, he was very friendly with Jimmy Villas for the aforementioned reasons, but also because Jimmy was a great opera buff, and they could discuss opera and they both drank.  Jim wrote about wine sometimes, but he was a scotch drinker.  He drank the Glenlivet.  The older Aaron brother, Sam Aaron’s brother, had sent him to France to learn about wine, and he’d gone.  And, as I say, he was a learned person.\n\tBut he certainly—I don’t think he ever typed.  I don’t think I ever saw him, type.  It just occurred to me.  He wrote in longhand, and it was not beautiful handwriting.  And besides, he wasn’t very patient.  His first two books, The Hors d’Oeuvre Book, which came out of Hors d’Oeuvre Inc., and they were fancy social people that he was friendly with, and the man of the two, the brother—whose name, I’m sorry, I cannot remember, but I’m sure it’s in The James Beard Celebration—he was furious.  He felt that Jim had stolen the recipes.  But certainly Jim wrote the recipes, and that’s his book.\n\tI left somebody important out, very important, John Ferrone.  John Ferrone was in New York, John Ferrone was an editor, and John Ferrone at some point, I can’t give you the chronology, but John Ferrone, who now lives, I think, in Pennsylvania—\n\nQ:  No, he lives here.\n\nKafka:  He lives back in New York?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nKafka:  And John was really devoted to Jim, and he was very important to The American Cookbook.  That was something really he did with Jim, and he had the wherewithal, in terms of intelligence and knowledge in how to do.  After Jim died, he did the correspondence book.  So I don’t know at what time he started.  You would have to ask John.  He may have been in on The Fireside Cookbook, for all I know.  I know that Jim was then living on 13th Street, I believe, and they used to wash the dishes in the bathtub.  But at what point John entered in, I don’t know.  José entered in after her stint at House and Garden or maybe before.  Before, because I think she did columns.\n\tHe would—as I said, later he did tapes.  How he started with José, I don’t know, whether they spoke the material or whether there were tapes, but I heard him make tapes when I was in California and send them to Richard in New York.\n\tBut, obviously, in a work sense, a food sense, he was comfortable around women.  I mean, he didn’t pick me, and he picked me for—\n\nQ:  What do you mean, he didn’t pick you and he picked you?\n\nKafka:  He picked me because, you know, there were all these people he could have asked to teach with him, and all of them would have been flattered and some of them could have made money, maybe, and he picked me, partly maybe because I was mistreated at Beard Glaser Wolf.  But the kind of conversation we could have, we both had read French, both read a lot of—we did research.  We were serious, in his view.  We knew the stuff.  So he picked me.  That’s what I meant.\n\tIn any case, because he had me—I don’t know the chronology exactly because there is one kicker in it.  It can’t have been after José left House and Garden.  He must have had a relationship with her before, because he got me a job, an assignment, to do one of the House and Garden cookbooks.  I wrote on, I think, steak.  Then Jim and I and José had another one of those discussions because I did a sauce Crécy for one of the steak sauces, and both José and Jim said, “Crécy is not a sauce for meat.”\n\tAnd I said, “If you will look at Ali Bab’s [Gastronomie Pratique]on page XXX, you will see Crécy as a sauce for steak.”\n\tJim loved that, you see.  José, I don’t think, ever loved that.  But in any case, the cookbook appeared.  So my time frame sense, you would have to research to get it right.\n\tWhere were we before?\n\nQ:  Actually, when you mention things like that, when I looked at places like, it’s easy to see references to you in New York Magazine online, and during this period of time, you were more and more referred to as a restaurant consultant.\n\nKafka:  I was.  I mean, I always did a number of things.  But when I worked for Joe, I became a freelancer.  I never was employed.  I’m really, as I said—\n\nQ:  A freelance what?\n\nKafka:  Anything.  I mean, I kept writing.  I kept editing.  I did the Cooking, which later became The Pleasures of Cooking.  I did The Store for H. Friedman, and I was working for Joe.  But, you know, as you do things, you begin to hire people, and I had Lois Bloom, who had worked for me on The Cooks’ Catalogue.  She was a friend that I had met at the hairdresser, and, again, like Renie [Sax], I just picked her.  You find what you need, and Lois was the best shopper I knew, and we had to find the stuff.  So I hired Lois, and then Lois came to work for me here.  There’s another office in the basement, which is where I worked in those days, because I had children and they were up here.\n\nQ:  How did you prioritize all that, balancing so many different—\n\nKafka:  Oh, I didn’t.\n\nQ:  I see.  [laughs]\n\nKafka:  Whatever was interesting and would pay me, I managed to get it done.  If I needed people to help, Lois found me a friend of hers who was good at numbers and had gone to culinary school.  I think she had gone to Brooklyn.  And she came and worked here.  And before that, I’d had an assistant who came.  Well, first, I’d had a secretary, and I found her through the local newspaper, the Yorkville whatever, the East Side local paper, which there was in those days.  I put in an ad.  She was a stay-at-home mother, obviously intelligent and nice, and she came to work for me, and because I didn’t need somebody full-time, it was a perfect arrangement for both of us.\n\tThen by the time I was doing cooking, I got a letter from a woman named Susan Grodnick, who wanted to work for the magazine, and I had said, “Well, come along and let me meet you,” and she seemed good.  She was a food-interested person.  She went on my recommendation to do other things, do other books.\nI had people testing.  All the testing has always been done here in this kitchen, unless it was a restaurant where I would work with the chef.  But usually the basic recipe was tested here before I gave it to the chef, because I had to taste it and see it, and also because being surrounded by all the ingredients and flavors, things would occur to me in the middle of something that I couldn’t pre-envisage.  So these people came, bit by bit.\nWhen I was going gangbusters, I had a woman named Jane Helse, who now lives on the West Coast and for a while taught and did cookery writing, but I don’t think does anymore.  But she was very good.  Then I had my beloved Chris Styler.\n\nQ:  I did speak with him, as you suggested.  He seems quite terrific.\n\nKafka:  He’s a dream.\n\nQ:  And he also described that he thought you had a recipe together, and that you’d think about something overnight and you’d come out the next day with something he never would have thought of that changed everything.\n\nKafka:  Yes.  I am inventive.  Greatest compliment Jim ever paid me was he used one of my recipes that I developed for class, because it got to the point where I was doing all the recipe development of new recipes.  And he asked if he could put it in his book.  He did not take it, he didn’t pay for it, but he asked if he might with attribution, and he did, which is the buckwheat noodles with caviar, freshwater caviar.\n\tOf course, on the other hand, I met Dafne Engstrom through him because she was in San Francisco.  She’s with Tsar Nicoulai [Caviar] today, but at that point it was California Sunshine, and she really has created a good caviar industry in America.  But she came and did a tasting for a class.  We had lot of tasting classes.\n\nQ:  These were with Jim Beard?\n\nKafka:  With Jim Beard in California.  I almost never gave classes on my own.  That, I had too much work to do, and I really wasn’t set up for it.\n\nQ:  Could we go back a little bit to Joe Baum?  I’d like you to just describe what working with him was like.\n\nKafka:  That’s hard.  That would take a long time.  Joe was extraordinary.  He was creative.  I told you about the Newarker.  I told you about the Hawaiian Room.  I mentioned the Forum of the Twelve Caesars where he had replicas made of the helmets of the guards and used those as coolers for wine.  He was always interested in more, learning more, doing more.\n\tBy the time I really got to know him, which was the second time I met him through when I went looking for a job, he was already down at the Trade Center as a consultant.  The whole thing of R.A. had exploded.  Tom Margittai, who with Paul Kovi later ran the Four Seasons after Joe left, and also the Forum of the Twelve Caesars, where he was the first to hire Marcella Hazan.  You see how all the links comes together.\n\nQ:  First to hire as a what?\n\nKafka:  As a consultant.  I mean, there are layer upon layer upon layer.  But Tom once defined a Joe Baum restaurant to me.  He said, “Joe has a brilliant idea, and he executes it brilliantly, but he charges too little.”  And he says, “Everybody will love it, and when they come to love it, we’ll raise the prices.”  And he does that, and then he raises the prices, and people get angry, and the restaurants lose money.  So, in any case, it was, by and large, true.  Joe was not—he had studied accounting, and, as I used to say, the most creative accountant I ever met.\n\tMichael Whiteman worked for him.  He’d been, I think, at Nation’s Restaurant News and had met Joe when he was doing a reportorial job, and Joe needed writers, even more than Jim.  He had great respect for writers, and he couldn’t write worth a damn.\n\nQ:  And he needed the writers to do what?\n\nKafka:  There’s a lot involved with restaurants.  First, when you’re selling the concept.  Then, for instance, when I was working on Windows, which was not the first thing I did, when I was working on Windows and had been exposed to the plan, he said, “Write me a thing on what it’s going to be like, what is the experience going to be like.”  And I had to take all the different rooms there were in theoretical existence and make a long writing piece about it.\nHe was asked to give speeches.  He was asked for articles.  He could not write.  His world was full of things like “hetchafetch” and “You know what I mean.”  That’s just who he was.  He also found people.  He found Michael.  He found me.\n\tWhen I first went there, part of the plan was that there were restaurants on all the floors where the elevators stopped, where you changed elevators.  There were only two  through elevators in the building, which went up to Windows.  So all the others were staggered.  On each of those floors, there was a restaurant, and he gave me the job —because he thought I knew about buying things—of outfitting the kitchen and mainly to do the tabletop and the display stuff.  Of course, I had no idea what I was doing, but I did it anyhow.\n\nQ:  Were you trying to do freelance writing on your own at the same time?\n\nKafka:  I did.  I always wrote.  I always wrote.  After I finished my stint at Vogue, I was writing for Playbill.  I didn’t know—I mean, I was really dumb in this sense.  They called me from Harper’s Bazaar and asked me to write for them.  I went down and met the editor-in-chief, Carmel Snow, and she commissioned pieces, and I didn’t know you couldn’t write for Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue at the same time.  That’s like as if you’ve been writing for the Sun and the—and I didn’t write for Vogue again for twenty years.  I finally did because of the art world connection.  Alex Lieberman was the creative director of Condé Nast, and we met fairly frequently, and he came here to dinner.  He was a very close friend of Helen Frankenthaler and Bob Motherwell, who were married at the time.  And I would give birthday parties, and he would come here and join.\n\tAfter one dinner we had out, he said, “You really should be back at Vogue,” and so he told Leo, who was then the features editor at Vogue, that I should be doing something.\nAnd Leo called me.  As I told you, I’d known Leo before.  I’d went to see him, and he said, “Well, we can either do a piece on you or a piece by you.”\n\tBy this time, I was doing a fair amount of consulting, so I said, “I’d rather have a piece on me,” and there was a piece on me, which is in the Vogue archives someplace.\n\tThat’s when I met Amy Gross, who was his assistant, and later, Amy’s assistant, Dana Cowin, who is now the editor of Food and Wine.  I mean, as I say, you know, claustrophobic world in which we knew each other.\n\nQ:  Before you were writing for Vogue and then the other magazines, was there a food presence in magazines?\n\nKafka:  Oh yes.\n\nQ:  Always?\n\nKafka:  Always.  I mean, I don’t know always, but in newspapers there was always a women’s page.  It may not be what it is today.  The food section has a life of its own.  It’s not linked to birth announcements and weddings, although it may come back to that.  [laughter]  So it was considered significant.  You have to remember that the Seven Sisters, not the colleges but the magazines, were all women’s magazines with important food sections, Good Housekeeping, Ladies’ Home Journal, McCall’s.\n\nQ:  That somehow seemed different to me than Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar and that sort of thing.\n\nKafka:  Well, Mademoiselle did not have food pages.  It deemed itself a much more intellectual magazine, although it was a fashion magazine, and certainly the people who were there, like Leo, were more the intellectuals.\nBut Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar were in some way competing with the women’s magazines.  Seventeen had food pages.  Mimi Sheraton worked there.  The newspapers, the more important ones, the Herald Tribune, had very good food pages.  Clementine was there.  When Clay [Felker] went off and started New York Magazine, he had important food pages, and he found Gail Greene.  So that it was not as peculiar as you think.  These were women’s magazines and, in fact, what was cooking.  I don’t know if Harper’s Bazaar had had food pages before me.  Vogue had, as I said.  Maxine was there.  Maxine was fancy, so she fitted the profile of a Vogue employee, and I just got in because of Leo.\n\nQ:  What about your voice?  Was it always your own?  Did it take a while to develop?\n\nKafka:  Not really.  I always wrote in the first person, even when I wrote for newspapers.  The Times made a big exception for me when I started writing for the Times in letting me write in the “I, me” person, because my feeling about it was not only pride; it was mainly that what I have to say is personal and is a direct communication with the reader and is not just about the thing, but it’s about the feeling, tone, the ambiance, and that’s what came naturally to me.\n\tI think the other reason it wasn’t so hard, if you read me, you’ll see I read pretty much the way I talk, and since I wanted to be a poet, I didn’t take all this too seriously, which made it easier.  In other words, if I had thought it was poetry, or if I thought I was [unclear], I might have had a great deal more trouble writing it.  But as it was, it just came out.  Unfortunately, there were deadlines, and I had to meet deadlines.\n\nQ:  And they were always opinionated?\n\nKafka:  Always.  When you read something as dumb as—they’re online, so you can find them at my microwave columns that I did for the Times.  They’ve stolen that material, incidentally.  I did never sign the agreement.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nKafka:  Never signed the agreement.  Jacques Pépin didn’t, but he made a statement that he would not sign.  I just didn’t sign, never got around to it.\n\nQ:  This was at what time are you talking about?\n\nKafka:  Well, there was a time when the Times asked everybody at the beginning of the internet really being important.\n\nQ:  It wasn’t only the Times; it’s everybody.\n\nKafka:  Yes, but it wasn’t then.  That was new to the Times.  And at that point—\n\nQ:  No, that’s what I meant.  At that point, everyone—\n\nKafka:  At the point at which it was new to the Times, they tried to get everybody to sign these releases.\n\nQ:  For past work as well as—\n\nKafka:  It was not that well formulated.  All work, I think.  But as I say, I just never signed it.  If my estate wants to sue, they can.  I don’t have the time for that sort of nonsense.\n\tSo, yes, I just wrote all that.  I edited this magazine, Cooking, and I wrote for it.  I wrote The Cooks’ Catalogue.  Not all the entries, those were written by Renie and other people.  Some I wrote, but the history pieces, the general introductions to what a given kind of group of implements might be, have developed and what they might be for, I wrote.\n\nQ:  When did you want to start to write your own cookbooks?\n\nKafka:  I didn’t.  I didn’t want to write a cookbook.  I thought that there were plenty of cookbooks already, and I had thousands of them.  I’ll take you downstairs and show you the rest.  But I had a tenant.  I have an apartment in this building that I rent out, and, oddly enough, the person who rented it at that point was Irena Chalmers.  Irena had started a series of paperback cookbooks, and she wanted me to write for her on California wine with a cookbook.  So I churned out this book American Food and California Wine, and I knew what I was talking about, about California wine by then.  I’d had a lot of time to learn and good grounding.  I did my typical recipes.  Buckwheat noodles are in there.\n\nQ:  Yes, I was looking at it this morning, actually.\n\nKafka:  The recipes that I’ve done over the years were in there, and I thought I was going to be criticized, not for the wine information, but somebody would say, “Why are these American?”  And, of course, there, you see, Joe and I had the same thing, which was American was what we did.  I’m very American.  Although I know French cooking, I speak French.  I know Italian cooking, I speak Italian.  I know Central American cooking, I speak a little Spanish, not a lot.  I speak some German.  I was exposed to Russian food growing up, as my father was Russian.  So I knew all these things, and certainly my base was French.  Ali Bab is probably the most important cookbook I’ve ever owned, and Jim’s The Fireside Cookbook was second, probably, in importance.  But I never wanted to copy anybody in anything.  That was never what I did and still not what I do.  I’m doing another cookbook, and it gets harder and harder because I don’t want to repeat myself, either.\n\nQ:  I want to go into that, but the reason I was leaning over was to look at the dates of American Food and California Wine and Food for Friends, with regard to when Jim Beard died.\n\nKafka:  Jim died, well, obviously, before The James Beard Celebration Cookbook.  He died like three years before that.  While, as I say, I wouldn’t call us friends in the usual way, I was at the hospital with him when he died.\n\nQ:  Yes, I’ve read that.  I was going to ask you.\n\nKafka:  And the only person that was there was Larry Forgione, who sort of worshipped him, not by knowing him but because of his American books.  By then, American was a big thing.  And Larry would just sort of sit in the room.\n\tTwo or three days before he died—I went over every day—Jim looked at me, he said, “I can’t anymore,” and he turned his face to the wall.  And that was the last time I think he ever spoke.\n\tHis doctor was a man named Denny Cox, who had taken class with us in New York, and Denny came in, and Jim had basically stopped breathing, I think.  Denny and I literally wheeled the bed over to intensive care to try and resuscitate him, which didn’t work.\n\tSo we had a very strong relationship, and I am very loyal.  Just as I do not forget insults, I do not forget friendship and people who have been good to me.  If Jim had ever called me after I left there, left him when he left himself, I would have gone and done anything for him.  These people were special people, and I owed them.\n\nQ:  How did you find out that he was in the hospital that last go-round?\n\nKafka:  I think he called me or Denny called me.  I don’t remember.  But Carlo, his friend upstairs, couldn’t bear hospitals, so he never came.  Judith came once, to give you the picture.  Larry came very day, and I was there every day.  And he wanted to hear things and know things, and we told about things.\n\nQ:  But did a lot of people come?\n\nKafka:  No.  I don’t think he would have welcomed a lot of people.  He did not particularly like to expose himself in weakness.\n\nQ:  Yes, who would.\n\nKafka:  But it’s interesting, the people who didn’t, and some people probably didn’t know.  I think Peter came a couple times.  He was close with Jimmy Villas, but I don’t think Jimmy came or may have come once, twice.  It wasn’t like it was a long, long stay.\n\tBut Judith was shocking to me, even though I should not have been shocked.  If you interview her, I have something you can ask her in her book.\n\nQ:  What would you like me to ask her?\n\nKafka:  Because it’s—I’m mean.\n\nQ:  Feel free.\n\nKafka:  She says that when she was in Paris and she and Evan rode around the country, they rode around in a Citroen Quatre Chevaux.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nKafka:  There was no Citroen Quatre Chevaux.  There was a Renault Quatre Chevaux, and a Citroen Deux Chevaux, which I know because I—\n\nQ:  I love it that you remember so precisely those things.\n\nKafka:  Ernie and I, my husband, drove around France in a Quatre Chevaux, and the Deux Chevaux was that thing with the—\n\nQ:  I remember the Deux Chevaux.  [laughs]\n\nKafka:  Right.  Then at one point she has herself going to Spence, and another she has herself going to another fancy women’s school in New York.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  Let’s talk about the development of your own cookbooks, because they—I don’t want to use a word like standard, in terms of the early ones, but then with Microwave Gourmet, it becomes an almost encyclopedic style that is fascinating to me.\n\nKafka:  I’m an autodidact and a pedant, my husband would be glad to tell you.  I take nothing on somebody’s say-so.  If somebody tells me that water boils in so many minutes, I’m going to do it myself.\n\tHaving written American Food and California Wine, which had a respectable little sale in soft-cover it then was, I wrote as a consultant/editor, writer for the Four Seasons.  I wrote the Four Seasons Cookbook.  That had been started.  Paula Wolfert had started putting down the recipes.  I’m very fond of Paula, but she has limitations as a writer and as a maker of books, and I think it’s no mistake that Couscous is still her most successful book.  But she’s a good cook.\n\tI didn’t know about it at the time, but Tom and Paul—I’m sure they paid her off for whatever she had done, but Tom and Paul, primarily Tom, with whom I’m still friendly—Paul, of course, is dead, so I can’t be friendly with him, but I was never as friendly with Paul.  I was always much more friendly with Tom.\n\n[Interruption]\n\n\nKafka:  The Four Seasons book, when I did that, there, again, Milton Glaser was involved in the design.  Yes, these things go around.  The editor at S and S [Simon and Schuster], who was the editor on the book, I think she inherited it, too, and that was Ann Bramson.  Now, speaking of loyalty, I have been with Ann ever since the Four Seasons Cookbook.  I was with her at—where was the first place?  And then Morrow, Simon and Schuster, Harper Collins, and whatever, and I’m still with her at Artisan.  So when I say I’m loyal, if you’re good to me, I stick with you.  It doesn’t mean that I haven’t had other propositions.  Take that however you want.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  But Microwave Gourmet, that was a major big deal and huge.\n\nKafka:  Well, at the time.  Well, first, before that, I wrote Food for Friends for Annie, and should you bother with it, much of what I write later is germinal in that.  I wrote a thing on roasting a chicken, which is not a recipe, and I had more people come to me and say, “Your roast chicken recipe is the best roast chicken I’ve ever made.” I guess I decided to turn it into a “real recipe.” Anyhow, but that was the next book and it was a very personal book.\nTo show you about editors and style, the introduction that I write is about a dialogue about what I’m going to cook, sort of with myself, what I’m going to cook for dinner.  And Ann wanted to get rid of it.  And I said, “No.  That’s who I am.  They need to know why this is the way it was.”  So that was the next book, and then I was looking around for something to write.\n\nQ:  Let me ask you about that a bit, because I couldn’t find my copy of it.  It was large, wasn’t it?  Or certainly not slim.\n\nKafka:  Yes, but not huge.  It’s next to that Microwave Gourmet.\n\nQ:  What was the task you set yourself in Roasting?\n\nKafka:  Writing a book.  Literally.  They were not programmatic.  American Food isn’t programmatic.  It uses American ingredients, some things that go with wine.  It has Lindy’s-type strawberry shortcake.  I mean, it has American ingredients, but that was the closest to a spine it had.  Food for Friends was literally about what I serve at this table and food that I thought people would like to make and do.  After Food for Friends, they do become more specific.\n\tWhen I was working with Jim doing the recipes, Sharp approached Jim and they wanted to send him a microwave.  Well, typical of Jim, like the Corning and whatever, that he should use it and whatever sponsor, he said, “Well, if you are going to send me one, you have to send Barbara Kafka one,” because at that point I was doing all the recipes.\n\tWell, it sat on my kitchen floor under a table in there for years, because neither he nor I could make any sense of it, and, as I told you, I don’t take anybody’s word for granted, and the cookbooks that came with it were just appalling.  So I, when my daughter—and this gives you a date in my life—went to medical school, she had an apartment, and I thought, “I’m never going to use this thing,” so I drove it over to her house, and I carted it up four flights of stairs.  There were the four flights of stairs.  I was a lot stronger in those days.  I thought all she’ll ever do is reheat, but she buys, and that’s what I thought it was good for in those days.\n\tShe came home, and I was bringing a big pot of water to the boil, and it had flour in it and it had lemon shells, and there was lemon juice, so obviously I was going to make artichokes, and I was trimming them.  She came in and she said—we get on very well now, but she said in a way that only one’s child can say to one, “Oh, I make one of those in six minutes in the microwave oven.”\n\tI continued making my artichokes, and the next day I went out and bought a microwave oven.  I thought I cannot be so dumb and so old and so stupid that I can’t learn to do this.  So I made an artichoke in the microwave oven, and it converted me.  It was certainly the best artichoke I’d ever made.  You know how the water stays in an artichoke and you burn yourself, and they get soggy, and the color turns revolting?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nKafka:  Well, it doesn’t do that in a microwave.  I don’t say it becomes jade green.  This is important about a microwave, because a woman up at Cornell in the food department—now dead and whose name I can’t remember, which I should—did a study of the vitamin retention, and the vitamin retention in microwaved vegetables is just incomparable.  Because if you look at the color, you can tell.  And even if you steam something, people say if you steam it, but the water turns color.  So the water in beta carotene is carried in the carotene, right, the orange and so on and so forth.\n\tSo that night or the next night, I was having six people to dinner.  I thought, hey, what a great trick this is.  I had no more idea how to get from one artichoke to six artichokes than flying to the moon.  But I managed it, and we had them, and everybody agreed they were very good.\n\tSo I kept on playing with it, because, as you said and I say, learning is the pleasure, and I just kept on learning and learning and learning.  It was all new to me.\nAt some point, Annie was looking for me to do another book.  I said, “Annie, you know, I think there might be a small book in microwave cooking.”\n\t“Microwave cooking?”\n\tI said, “Yes, really, there are things it does very well, it does better.  It does sugars,” you know.  And she trusted me, and she gave me a contract, and that was Microwave Gourmet.  And like Topsy, it grew, and the reason it grew so big was I didn’t want to slow down the flow of the book by putting every timing for every quantity in the major recipe.  So I created this back section of the book in order to have a place, a reference guide, that people could turn to.\n\tWell, Annie went off to have it set, and this is when having been a linotyper and all of this came into play.  She said, “Barbara, you have to cut out the glossary.  The whole thing isn’t going to fit.”\n\tI said, “You take it down two points and it’ll fit,” and it did.\nSo that’s how Microwave Gourmet came into being, and I have never been so assaulted as I was when that book came out.  You can go into the files.  Those were the ladies pages of the newspapers, they were all being written by home-ecs, and I had known Helen McCully when she was at, I guess, Ladies’ Home Journal or McCall’s, and she had been fiercely attacked by the home-ecs because she didn’t wash her chicken.  It was important to them that she was the first editor of one of those big magazines, women’s magazines, who was not a home-ec, and they were protecting their turf.\n\tI started writing in March.  Who was it came to see me and spoke to the woman who was then editor of the food page, and she’s now the editor at Consumer Reports?  Slade.  She queried me about writing a column for them on microwave cooking.  It was before the book appeared.  It was in March of that year that I started writing that column.  The fall of that year, the book came out.  There’d been not a peep out of the microwave people.\n\nQ:  You started already in March, and in the fall it came out?\n\nKafka:  No.  I’d been writing for a long time.  It may have been Barbara Costikyan who made the connection; I don’t remember.  And they got twenty-two letters the first day of that column after the book came out, so obviously it was a concerted thing.\n\nQ:  Campaign.\n\nKafka:  And they basically all said, “I’m a home economist and what she does is not what we do and it’s incorrect and she’s going to kill people.”  Oh, yes, dear.\n\nQ:  How would following those recipes have killed people?\n\nKafka:  Well, first of all, I deep-fat fried small amounts of things in the microwave.  In fact, I mean, it took several years for me to recover from this.  In fact, you can get hurt deep-fat frying if you put something wet on top of the stove.  It’s going to spatter and burn you.  I was only doing small quantities, and the heat doesn’t continue to go up and all kinds of technical things.  But that was a no-no to them.\n\tThen I tightly covered the containers with cling film, as the Brits would say.  And that was a no-no.  They all vented the cling film, theoretically, I suppose, so it wouldn’t explode.  No reason why it should, because it stretches and it makes a balloon and you can prick it and what have you.  It was actually much safer, because when you pricked it and then you took the container out of the oven, you were much less liable to burn yourself than you were the other way.\nAnd also, but this only turned out later, I was prescient without knowing it, that the thing that is not good for you in plastic are the plasticizers.  They migrate.  And by making this tight covering, they didn’t start out touching, and when the balloon came up, it held the plastic totally over it, away from it, so that it never touched it.  The problem is usually in the presence of fat.\n\tBut in any case, the last laugh was mine.  But all over the country—now, you understand that these women did not have microwaves when they became home-ecs.\n\nQ:  Of course.\n\nKafka:  Because there were none.  Period.  But they had a society.  I mean, it was ghastly.\n\tI went out to California.  I was doing the book tour and I got a telephone call from the New York Times editor saying, “You’d better get back here,” and that was just after the book had come out.\nI came back on the red eye, instead of civilized, and I was scheduled to speak that evening at the Campbell Microwave Institute.  And I went in to—let’s see.  I don’t know why her name is leaving me.  It will come to me.  And she took me in to see Ms. Newhouse, who was editor of all the what I call soft porn sections, you know, travel, whatever, whatever, whatever, and she then went on to do the big travel section for the Times on Sunday.\n\nQ:  You mean Nancy Newhouse?\n\nKafka:  Nancy Newhouse, yes.  And she was lovely.  She said to me, “This is what’s happened.  What’s it about?”  And as quietly and as rationally as I could, I told her and gave her my side of the story.  And she said, “Okay.”  Do you know that people in the Times stopped her in the hallway and thanked her, not food section people, that it was so rare for an editor to take the word of an author and support them.  It helped that my column was extremely popular by then.  I’ve always had very popular public exposure. \nWhen I wrote for Gourmet, Jane Montant told me they had readership surveys.  I was the most-read column, most-read thing in Gourmet.  Because this voice makes people think that they know me, and they do to a certain extent.\nSo anyhow, after that, with Microwave Gourmet, I said to Annie, “You know, Annie, you don’t have to use fat in a microwave oven to cook, and these vitamins retain all of these vitamins.  It’s a very healthful way to cook and an easy way to lose weight.”  So she went back.  She was at Morrow by this time.  The editor-in-chief at Morrow, not the food editor, who was Narcisse Chamberlain, but the editor loved the idea, and she came up with a great title, Micro Slim Gourmet.  Great title.\n\tGod preserve us from success.  Everybody had an idea what the book should be called, the sales reps, the bookstores, the chains, and came out with the world’s worst title, Microwave’s Health Style Cookbook.  Turgid, heavy, not Barbara.\n\nQ:  [laughs] Not going to sell either.\n\nKafka:  Not going to sell. And of course it sold into the bookstores because Microwave Gourmet had been such a success.  I mean, I had experiences.  They only printed, I think, 5,000 or 10,000 copies of Microwave Gourmet, and I had people calling me as they used to do when I was at Windows.  People would call me at seven o’clock at night and say, “My aged mother is dying, and her last request is to go to Windows on the World.”  Or, “I went to kindergarten with you.  You may not remember me.”  Well, I had the same sort of thing with Microwave Gourmet.  “I must have a copy for a Christmas present for X, Y, or Z, who is important in my life, and I can’t find one.”  Of course you couldn’t find one.  They ran out before Christmas.\n\nQ:  But they reprinted it, didn’t they?\n\nKafka:  But not before Christmas.  Oh, no, it went on to sell many copies.  As I said to a friend, I’ll never have such a successful cookbook again, in terms of sheer numbers.\n\nQ:  It was the most successful?\n\nKafka:  It was the most successful.  So, Health Style.  I’ve never not made back my advance, but Health Style was not what you would call a winner.\nAnn was still at Morrow, and she had been with Food for Friends with me, and I had told her the story about the chicken.  She said, “Oh, Barbara, there might be a book in roasting, because people need the information.”  Hmm.  So that’s how Roasting came into being.  Well, as I say, I’m hideously thorough, and I want to do my research and I want to get it done, but I also wanted food that people would want to eat.  See, you have the seduce people.  The recipes are seduction, and the style of a recipe is rather stereotypic today.  And it has to be.  This is the next conversation I’m going to have with Ann.   Gourmet, for instance, used to, in the magazine—there was no list of ingredients.  “You take two cups of butter.”\n\nQ:  Oh, a long time ago, yes.\n\nKafka:  Yes, a long time ago.  Now, the standard is list the ingredients, they must be listed in the order in which they’re going to be used, which is ridiculous, because you ought to list the main ingredient first, in the order in which they’re going to be used, and then you write flaccid prose.  But, in any case, that is not my style, and I had, of course, learned something, even I, from Microwave Gourmet, which is everybody loved that back section of the book.  People would tell me, “It’s the only book I have in my kitchen,” meaning “I have other cookbooks, but I have to keep that one in my kitchen for the thing.”\n\tSo I thought, “Don’t be a dummy, Barbara.”  That’s why Roasting has all those timings for different quantities and amounts in the back of the book, and, again, it helped sell the book because people used it as a reference.  And if it was a food, maybe I could roast it.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  So Microwave Gourmet sold more than—\n\nKafka:  Anything.\n\nQ:  —Soups or Vegetable Love, which I like a lot, Vegetable Love.  I see Party Food.\n\nKafka:  I did Party Food, and I thought it was a needed book, and Annie wanted a color book.  Those were the days when publishers could afford color.  And it’s now OP [out of print].  It just went OP because they can’t afford to reprint it with the color.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nKafka:  That book was madly successful with caterers.  I mean, more parties I’ve been to and found my recipes, which is fine.  You want to be useful.  Really, since Jim, there had only been Martha Stewart, and she’s done very well, but hers were not my style, so I did my own, and I did all the styling of the food and all the props came out of this house and my house in Vermont.  Nothing was borrowed.  Nothing was bought specifically.  And that was Party Food.\n\tAnd then, as I say, I was at Morrow, and after Health Style and after—if Roasting was still at—I guess Roasting was at Morrow, too.\n\n\nQ:  Could you tell me what you’re working on now?\n\nKafka:  Yes.  Oh, and we left out the Opinionated Palate, which I had done.\n\nQ:  The collection of recipes, yes.  I mean of columns, right.\n\nKafka:  Right.  I am working on a book where once I got the title, which will not change, I had to write the book.  It’s called The Intolerant Gourmet.  It not only describes my character, but the fact that I was celiac as a young child, and in my dotage, it has come back to haunt me and I can no longer eat wheat or lactose.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nKafka:  Well, you know, Eastern European Jew, I can’t eat lactose.  But I’m very tired of people thinking it’s so awful and so difficult.  It’s not, and so I’m doing that cookbook.\n\nQ:  So, what else will be in it?  I mean, how do you see the book developing?\n\nKafka:  Spottily.  I never know with a book how it’s really going to be organized till I do it.  In other words, when I wrote Soup, A Way of Life, I had all the recipes and I had them organized in the usual—or I suppose usual for most people—fashion, vegetables and this and that and the other, and it was all right.  Then I thought, you know, it’s going to stop people to start with vegetable soups.  It’s not seductive.  So I said, what is the most seductive soup?  Chicken soup.  And every part of the world that I know of, except for South India, makes a chicken soup.  But I didn’t want to write about it as a technical tour de force, so I wrote about it as a family memoir, and that’s when I created that whole section, because that, to me, is what soup is about in people’s lives.  It’s not about fancy clarified bouillons, but about family soup.\nAnd it was fascinating when I told Zarela Martinez, and she said, “What’s the new book?”\n\tAnd I said, “It’s called Soup, A Way of Life.”\n\tShe said, “Soup?  But that is Mexican.”  In Ecuador, they don’t say, like they do in China, have you had rice today?  Instead of have you eaten, they say, have you had soup today?\n\tSo it reified my point of view, and that’s what that is, and members of my family had things that they liked that were in that section.  But I couldn’t have told you that before I wrote the book than fly to the moon.\nSo a typical thing that I do is I write a recipe and then I organize the recipes into chapters, usually in rather conventional ways, and then I write introductions to the recipes, separate introductions, which I suppose could be summarized into two sentences: why you want to make this recipe and what you need to know to make this recipe.\n\tThen I look at the damn thing and I see what feels wrong or what it still needs or where there are holes.  Yes, I did lots of vegetable soups, but I don’t have anything with.  Or I have to address the fact that I don’t put rutabagas in this book.  Well, then I have to tell people I don’t like rutabagas.  The new book has a rutabaga recipe and I think the recipe is called Taming the Rutabaga.  It’s one recipe.\n\tSo the new book, in a sense, aside from its subtext, I don’t know that it will have as much general information on eating as Health Style did.  That was fun learning all that traditional information, and I appeared on panels at the FDA in Washington.\n\tThen when it’s gotten as formed as I can make it, then I write the introductions and the introductory material, or I take—I mean probably not in this book, but take what I do and slam it into a thing in the back.  So each of those things happens as a result of what the thing is.  So it’s an ongoing procedure.\n\nQ:  When is this one due?\n\nKafka:  It isn’t.  When it comes, it comes.  I mean, my feet have taken a chunk out of my life.\n\nQ:  In any case, we will all look forward—\n\nKafka:  Thank you.\n\nQ:  —to the next one, and let me thank you so much for speaking with me.\n\nKafka:  My pleasure.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKafka – 2 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Barbara Kafka\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    Session #3\n\nInterviewer:   Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t           New York City\n\nDate:  April 13, 2009\n\nQ:  We were starting to talk about Joe Baum.\n\nKafka:  Yes, because certainly he was an extraordinary man, and he was a very consistent part of Jim Beard’s life.  He was a supporter.  He gave him work to do, which was more important toward the end of Jim’s life when he was not as strong and as independent.  But starting with the Four Seasons, Joe hired him as a consultant.  Joe is the first person who had a restaurant that concentrated on American food, local food, fresh ingredients.  John Cage picked wild mushrooms for him.  He grew herbs on top of the Four Seasons.  He was very involved with research, and he really, to my mind, was the person who put or organized a significant new American food onto the menu.\n\nQ:  Was it recognized as such?\n\nKafka:  Yes, and it was successful.  It was informal in the bar room, but I think people were particularly—for instance, Jim talked to him about baking potatoes that used to be served on the railroad.\n\nQ:  Jim talked to—\n\nKafka:  Joe.  Talked to him about baking potatoes, that the railroads used to have specially grown, very huge baking potatoes.  I don’t know if they’re still on the menu, but for years they were there.  And if people knew, people in the know, and they would have one of these things as a great treat.  All of these things were radical in their way at the time.  You may not see it today as radical, but it was radical then.\n\nQ:  Could you describe the contrast between what else was out there at that point, how this was radical?\n\nKafka:  There were checked tablecloth Italian restaurants.  There were French bistros.  There were fancy French restaurants.  There was always, at that point, hotel food, international food, all of it really fairly mundane.  There was wonderful food in New York as well.  There was good Chinese food.  There was good Asian foods of other kinds.  There were very talented chefs like Soltner, who were making wonderful things, but they were not making things that honed in on local fresh food, seasonal food.  I mean, you can tell how important fresh was because it was called the Four Seasons, and every season the décor changed and along with it, the menu.\n\nQ:  And was that more Joe Baum or James Beard or both?\n\nKafka:  Joe.  Which doesn’t mean that Jim didn’t—I mean, Jim certainly would understand it, go along with it, and help with it, but Joe was the driving creative force.  Jim was a repository of knowledge that was extraordinary, and Joe used his knowledge.  I mean, he paid to use it, but he used his knowledge as a source.  But Jim was more interested in communication, in teaching, in being involved with people than he was with—I mean, he liked restaurants.  He wrote about them often.  He went to them a great deal.  But creating a restaurant was not his big deal.\n\nQ:  It’s a huge amount of work.\n\nKafka:  Oh yes, it’s a lot of work, and Joe worked very hard, and he was extraordinarily productive and creative.  After the Four Seasons, although he did do Zum Zum, which was German, and he did various other, quote, “ethnic” restaurants.  I mean, things that today are taken for granted.  He had a Central and South American restaurant in the Time-Life building.  It was before its time.  It was wonderful.  I think that was the first place I interviewed him for the article in Revue des Vins de France, and it was wonderful food.\nHe had sent Mimi Sheraton down to those countries, and she was supposed to come back with ideas.  Then he hired Alexander Girard, who was a great graphics person, who had a wonderful collection of folk art, which, when they folded the restaurant and Joe was no longer there, the collection went up at auction for nothing.  It was ridiculous.\nSo he had a vision.  Sometimes it was too early, but it was extraordinary.  It was beautiful.  They had open grills, all kinds of things that people take for granted today.  You take for granted today that you can buy a tortilla in the supermarket.  You couldn’t buy a tortilla to save your life in New York City in those days.  So he was just remarkable and very creative, very intelligent, and I think he and Jim got on because they were both extremely intelligent and they both had a memory of foods and things they’d eaten and styles, and they came together over those things.\n\nQ:  You started to say something indicating that there was a difference between the grillroom and the other room.\n\nKafka:  There is.\n\nQ:  I meant in the menu.\n\nKafka:  They’re different menus.\n\nQ:  But was one of them more in line with his thinking?\n\nKafka:  No, they were both that way.  But you’d have a hamburger in the grillroom on the menu, and you’d have something a lot fancier in the poolroom.  I mean, if you were a regular and you wanted a hamburger in the poolroom, I’m sure somebody would have obliged you.\nAnd American wines, I mean, these things were not common then.  And, of course, Jim went out to California a lot.  He was very close to Helen Evans Brown, and she gave the first citation that I could find for a dip.  You know how dips have taken over the world.  And I don’t mean in the Tango.  She had a guacamole.  Well, this was a California woman, right?  But guacamole today is a standard.  It’s a cliché.  It’s, quote, “boring.”  There’s even a tortilla chip that’s called guacamole, as if it were the only thing they would ever be used for.  So we have come a far piece, and it’s hard to look back and understand just how extraordinary what was being done was there.\nOf course, Jim was a West Coaster.  He lived in New York even before the Second World War.  But there was some part of him that was very loyal to the West Coast, and he had seen and tasted a lot out there.\n\nQ:  It seemed to me that his thinking had to be formed by the food out there, or informed.\n\nKafka:  It wasn’t like that there either.\n\nQ:  It wasn’t.\n\nKafka:  No.  Dungeness crab, he loved.  And he was always interested in people who were doing things with ingredients, so that what is now Tsar Nicoulai caviar, Dafne Engstrom remade the caviar industry in America.  Well, at one of our tasting classes, he had a tasting of her different caviars, and he was very interested in all that.\n\nQ:  I guess what I wondered was, was there greater access to local foods out there?\n\nKafka:  In California?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nKafka:  I think you had to go looking.  You have to remember that, as with most places, there were supermarkets.  They were not local particularly.  They were price-sensitive.  The climate is more conducive to growing things for more of the year, but it’s only when you get to Alice Waters, who Jim supported as well.  He championed her.  He took me there the first time I was there.  And she was very into it, as you know—and it’s gotten to the point where it’s proselytizing and not all of it worked out, but in any case.  So Tom Chino—well, that’s not local for her.  He’s down near L.A.  So within a hundred miles, which is the definition which most of those people give, would not be accurate.\nFor instance, Joe and I put Olympia oysters on the menu in the Cellar in the Sky.  Now, Jim, of course, knew about Olympia oysters.  He came from that part of the country.  But nobody in this part of the world, and even out there, it took a long time for people to think they were good.\nJon Rowley is a seafood maven, and he does a great deal of work with companies and with so forth, and he discovered—he’s in Seattle—that there were mussels that he had never seen mussels like them in the bay.  And he called me.\n\nQ:  This is the San Francisco Bay?\n\nKafka:  No.  Outside of Seattle.  And he called me and he described them to me, and I said, “John, those are Mediterranean mussels, and they must have come off a ship and taken hold.”\n\tSo he took them to an academic and, yes, indeed, they were Mediterranean mussels, which are different.  They’re redder, they are smaller, they grow somewhat differently on the West Coast than they do in Europe, but all of those things—well, that came after Joe, but all of those things, that’s the kind of thing that I could have gone into Joe’s office and said, “Joe, I’ve just found out we can get Mediterranean mussels from the Pike Place Market.”  And, by god, we’d have Mediterranean mussels from the Pike Place Market on the menu.  So it was extraordinary.\n\nQ:  How do you account for that?\n\nKafka:  For Joe?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nKafka:  Brilliance.\n\nQ:  And openness to new ideas?\n\nKafka:  His parents owned a hotel restaurant in Saratoga.  He worked there.  He grew up in the business.  But I think he was just very curious, very open to—and very sensual in many ways, and also because he realized that new things sold in New York.  They were stories.  He was very press-sensitive as well.  So if he had a restaurant in Washington and he’d had the first mussels, Mediterranean mussels, on his thing, then his version of Roger Martin, who was his PR person, would have contacted you at the newspaper and say, “Hey, have I got a something for you to taste.  Come on in and let’s have lunch.”\n\nQ:  That was smart.\n\nKafka:  And another story would be born.  And stories, as we all know, sell.\n\nQ:  You talked a little bit about the projects that you did with him and for him, but I wondered if we should gather them together in one place.\n\nKafka:  I basically wrote about him to begin with, and then there were all these different food places in the Trade Center, the ones on the inter floors and, of course, Windows on the World.  I started out essentially buying china, glass, and silver tabletop and equipment, because he thought I must know how to do that after The Cooks’ Catalogue.  I hadn’t got a clue, but I did it.  And then he began to play with menu, so he told me to write a menu.”\nSo I wrote a menu, and he would show me.  He’d say, “That’s not a menu item.  That’s an ungarnished thing.  It’s not a menu item.”\nThen at some point, I said to him, “Joe, you don’t have any wine.  You don’t have a wine program.”\nHe said, “Make me a wine list.”\nThere was nothing he didn’t trust me with to do, and I did it for him.  He had other people as well; I’m not saying that I was unique.  Michael Whiteman was there and probably wrote more of his speeches.  But the first place was—I forget what it was, on the forty-fourth floor or something, it was one of the inter floor things, because it was finished, whereas Windows was—I remember standing up on the slab with him on the top of Windows, what was going to be Windows on the World.\nBut, I mean, his powers of persuasion as well.  He got the Trade Center people to, instead of keeping the same line of the windows going up all the way to the top, to broaden out on the top two floors that were going to be Windows and make the mullions further apart for the view.  So there was nothing that didn’t interest him.  The size of a chair, the comfort of a chair, the look of a chair.  He was extraordinary.\n\nQ:  And to what extent did he and James Beard stay in regular touch, do you know?\n\nKafka:  Oh, I think they spoke every few weeks.  Jim didn’t come into Windows.  It was too far and it was by then too difficult and he didn’t do anything in the kitchen.  I mean, there I was, still a youngish woman, and I’d made the menu, and there I was telling this older French chef what to do, what we were cooking.\n\nQ:  How did that work for you?\n\nKafka:  With a great deal of friction, but André René really tried.  He really tried.  And Joe and I and so forth would have tastings to taste the foods and so forth, and I would sometimes have to go into the kitchen during regular service and say to André, “You know, you’re cheating again.  You’ve got caramel in that sauce instead of brownings,” and so on and so forth.\nYes, I never had the cleanest mouth in the world, but I certainly learned how to swear up a storm in the kitchen.  I mean, kitchens can be violent places.  I once stepped between two guys who were going to go at each other with knives.  And I learned that if somebody said, as I was carrying a pot, “Dear, would you like me to carry that for you?” to say, “Keep the fuck off.  I can carry it myself.”  Because if you didn’t, then you were a girl.\n\nQ:  Can we talk a little bit about Jim Beard toward the end of his life at that point?  Well, actually, let me start another way.  To what extent did the food world, meaning in part the home economists and in part the more sophisticated part of the food world, realize how important he was?\n\nKafka:  The home economists respected nobody.  They had Helen McCully.  They attacked her.  They attacked me like crazy.  They didn’t set out after Jim so much.  I mean, I think there were advantages to being a man and a big strong man.  That made it easier.  But home economists were becoming more and more irrelevant.\nJim, I think everybody in the food world, and that kept growing, recognized his importance.  I don’t think they knew exactly why he was important.  They knew he had the column, they knew he had books, they knew that he taught, and they knew that he was a presence.  But I’m not sure, even today, I don’t think people pay enough attention to his extraordinary intelligence and his voraciousness with cookbooks and history and so forth, which made the American food book possible.\nThe most visible influence, from most people’s point of view, was his espousal of grilling, outdoor cooking, because that’s something, as you may have noticed, men will do, and therefore he served as a role model.  Gay though he may have been, that was an acceptable role.  And he was very popular.  His column was very popular.  It was in hundreds of newspapers.\n\nQ:  What is your take on why he was important and remains to be, obviously?\n\nKafka:  Well, all of these things, and he had a voice, which was particular, that he communicated with men and gay men as well as women.  His was not necessarily directed at little ladies at home, although many women were still at home.  He had traveled.  He had drunk wine.  In those senses he was a sophisticate, and he was an important influence in that he went to new restaurants and found out about the chefs and promoted them, and he had this thing about American food, which was a major influence and certainly again was early.  And it’s not the American food you’re hearing about today.\n\nQ:  Tell me what you mean.\n\nKafka:  Well, when I wrote American Food and California Wine, which was my first book, I thought people would accept the California wine part because it was informational, but I thought surely somebody was going to say, “What makes this American food?”  Because it was really far out for that time.  It probably looks tame today, but it was far out for then.\nAnd Jim was writing about a more traditional American food.  You know, as a newspaper person, you’ve seen all the readers’ columns in newspapers, my mother’s roast turkey, the pan dowdy, the whatever, and that’s what interested him, the traditional and not necessarily colonial, but what people made at home, as against all this restaurant food.  And he had an enormous collection, at that time, of cookbooks of the twenties, thirties, and so forth, and went back to them.  So it was a different kind of American food.  More interest in chowders and things like that.\n\nQ:  Do you think there was a lapse of interest in American food after he died, or was there a thread that was continuous?\n\nKafka:  Well, we had entered the era of Julia, and Jim sponsored Julia at the beginning.  They were both at Knopf.  They had the same editor, Judith Jones, and Jane Friedman, who was a wonderful publicist, was publicist for their books.  And so Jim gave a party to introduce Julia to the food world.  He did the same thing for Richard Olney, who was not at all American in style, although he was an American.\nBut Julia, I think, spoke to Jim.  She was as big as he was, not quite as tall, but pretty darn close, and she was a big woman, big bones, big woman, hearty, Californian, West Coast again.  He was comfortable with her.  So the era of Julia started—I mean, these are recurrent things, nothing is linear all the time—French food, making it at home.  Certainly some of it should never be made at home, in my opinion, but she got people to make French bread at home, lining the oven with terracotta bricks and what have you.  So Jim admired her for that.\nI think at that point there wasn’t the same thing.  Italian food was beginning to be respectable; not checked tablecloth.  I’m not talking in New York necessarily; I’m talking around the country.  But he liked talent and people.  He liked Marcella Hazan.  He did not like Diana Kennedy.  Because he was also loyal, so he had much earlier sponsored work with Lizzie Lambert Ortiz, who was also an English woman like Diana and like his mother, and who had lived in Mexico, like Diana, and was married to—she was married to somebody at the U.N.  So that was his authority on Hispanic food, Mexican food, and he never switched loyalties.  He could turn on people, but he didn’t in those cases.\nSo there were all sorts of things beginning to happen.  I mean, Chicago has become the second largest Mexican city in the world, moving from California and what have you, and now you’re going to see it move into the general population.  I mean, you can go to any supermarket and you can find masa de harina, you can find beans in cans, you can find tortillas, taco chips.  I mean, they’re standard.\nI remember when there was one—whose name is now escaping me, but one Hispanic restaurant, and then there was Victor’s, which was Cuban.  But there was one.  So lots of things have come along, and I think American food has in a funny way been taken for granted, and it’s been co-opted in the same way that I co-opted it.\nAll the chefs, except for Daniel [Boulud]—but even Eric Ripert is using American fish.  He’d be a fool not to.  And he’s modified his cooking.  So that what goes around comes around, you know.\n\nQ:  Did he leave a space to be filled after he died?\n\nKafka:  Oh, it left a very large one.\n\nQ:  I mean, were there conversations?\n\nKafka:  There were lots of people.  Marion thought she was that person, Cunningham.  She certainly looked the part, sort of like a Grant Wood.\n\nQ:  You mean that person representing American food?\n\nKafka:  Yes, the American.  She did the Fannie Farmer and she’s done a breakfast book, or she had done.  And so she, in a sense, took that over, and he got her the job to do the Fannie Farmer.\nSo there were lots of people, but you have to remember there were lots of people before, too.  I mean, Poppy Cannon went over and worked with Alice B. Toklas on her second book.  Just scads of people.  So I don’t think it’s that there is a dearth of people.  I think there are positions that he took that probably are not being taken.  I don’t know if he ever did one, but let’s say something like a tuna casserole.  Now, mac ‘n cheese has become a big restaurant item and is coming back, but it’s not coming back because it’s American.  It’s taken for granted, and it should be wonderful, and maybe it should have brie in it.\nSo I don’t think Jim—nobody replaces one for one another person.  And you can see, if you look at Erma Rombauer’s books, you can see what she did, which was extraordinary in her era, extraordinary.  And that was American food.  And then her daughter and I think her daughter-in-law continued with those books.  Now, if you look at them, they become more international.\n\nQ:  The various editions of the Joy of Cooking.\n\nKafka:  Yes.  And, of course, that is what was happening in America.  They’re not very good compared to what she did with her stuff, and I would always suggest that people go back and look at an early edition.  The last edition that came out was, again, a crazy quilt.\nBut that’s just to say there are all these people.  There was Paula Peck on baking.  But think of all the different cuisines.  I hate the word “cuisine.”  All the different kinds of cooking.  It’s just like Jim hated the word “gourmet.”  He said, “The gore-me people.”\n\nQ:  And to him that meant, obviously, I guess—\n\nKafka:  Pretension.  We were cooks, we were not chefs, and I still don’t like to be called a chef.\n\nQ:  It’s inappropriate, really.\n\nKafka:  I’m not a chef.\n\nQ:  Yes, exactly.\n\nKafka:  I have worked as a chef, but I am not a chef, that’s not my training, that’s not my background.  But we had a French person who was very successful before Julia.  We had Dione Lucas.  Little alcoholic, but otherwise.  Julia could knock them back and so could Jim.\n\nQ:  But I think certainly when he died, what we see is a different landscape altogether than when he started out.\n\nKafka:  Yes, but his last book, which was really about younger chefs, he was not left out or left behind.  He was very aware.  As I said, he’s very intelligent, and he saw what was happening, and he was not grudging about it.\n\nQ:  What was happening, meaning?\n\nKafka:  In food.\n\nQ:  Just amplify a little bit.\n\nKafka:  Just all the stuff I’ve been talking about.  All the international influences, the young chefs, young American chefs.  When he started, chefs were European in fancy restaurants.  By the time he died, they were Americans, Larry Forgione, all Americans.  Larry, of course, was very influenced by Jim.  As I told you, he sat in his hospital room.  Jim’s version of American food was something that Larry was deeply involved with.  There were all kinds of people.\nIt’s always a mistake to think that something is really new and really different.  There are new things and there are different things, but there are echoes.  There are continuities.  I used to get so tired when everybody was doing their year-end wrap-up for newspapers and television shows, and people would call me, some eager young reporter who had been given the assignment, and they would say something like, “Isn’t it wonderful that we have French bistros today?”\n\tAnd I said, “Well, we had French bistros here in the thirties.”  They just have no memory and no sense of history.  Whereas Jim had both a memory and a sense of history.  And he was generous with other writers, giving blurbs and so on and so forth.\n\nQ:  What happened immediately after he died?\n\nKafka:  Nothing.\n\nQ:  I know he didn’t want anything particular.\n\nKafka:  Jim was somebody who wanted posterity and didn’t.  He had talked about and gotten involved with Burt Wolf, because this cooking school idea was going to be his memorial, and he was going to have all this teaching and all of that going on.  Well, of course, he never did anything about it, and he left his money to Reed College, which he was thrown out of.  So it’s a really odd story.  He really didn’t want to confront the grim reaper, and while he wanted immortality, as I suppose everybody does, the only way he can have it is presumably—I mean, Peter Kump tried for him with the Beard Foundation.\n\nQ:  I was going to ask you, why was it Peter Kump who took up that role?\n\nKafka:  We used to teach at Peter Kump’s.  Peter had a cooking school and he started by cooking in having the school in somebody else’s space, I think it was a kitchen for advertising or something, and so Jim and I would go there and we would teach, and then I kept teaching for Peter.  And Peter, again, was loyal.  He felt this deep connection with Jim.\n\nQ:  And the committee was assembled by him, or other people volunteered the committee to—\n\nKafka:  By whom?  By Peter?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nKafka:  Yes, Peter essentially.  Peter was the engine, and he raised the money.  I mean, the house had to be bought and it had to be paid off, and that’s why I wrote The James Beard Celebration was to try and raise some money for the house.  So each of us did something.\n\nQ:  Thank you.  This is great.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKafka – 3 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n","description":"An acclaimed presence in the food world for decades, Barbara Kafka has been a cookbook author, food writer, and a food and restaurant consultant.\r\n\r\nNo other writer working today can claim as long a professional association with James Beard.

TTT\n\nInterviewee:  Marion Nestle \t\t\t\t\t\t        Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t        New York City\n\nDate:  May 19, 2009\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It’s May 19, 2009, and I’m with Marion Nestle in her office at New York University. \nGood afternoon.\n\nNestle:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  It’s nice to be with you.  Could we start by your telling me a little about when and where you grew up, and what your childhood and what your parents were like?\n\nNestle:  I was born in the mid thirties, 1936, someplace in Brooklyn.  I don’t remember where.  My family lived in Brooklyn until I was two or three, and then moved out to Long Island, first to Northport, where we lived, oh, until I was five, probably, and then we moved to Great Neck, where I lived until I was nine, and then we moved to Manhattan, and I don’t have much memory of anything except Northport.  I remember some things about Northport, which was then a small fishing village on the north shore of Long Island, with pristine water that I remember swimming around the docks downtown where there were starfish on the posts.  No more.  No more.\n\tThen we moved to Great Neck, where I went to kindergarten, first, second, and third grade, and then in the middle of the third grade we moved to Manhattan, 115th Street between Broadway and Riverside Drive.\nSo my father was a kind of a public relations person, who had jobs intermittently; he didn’t work very steadily.  And my mother was a housewife.  I suppose the most interesting memory that I think about the most when I think about what it was like to live on upper Broadway in those days was that I walked to school from 115th to my school on 109th by myself twice a day.  I came home for lunch and then went back, and that’s a quarter of a mile, and I was six, seven, eight at the time, and that was considered perfectly acceptable.\n\nQ:  And perfectly safe.\n\nNestle:  And perfectly safe.  And after school I would get my bicycle or go out with friends, and go out and play.  I had piano lessons in the Village, and with a nickel I took the subway down to the Village.  I went to my piano lessons by myself from the ages of seven through eight, by myself, or rode my bicycle in the park, and was completely free to go around the city by myself from the age of eight on.\n\nQ:  What were your parents like?\n\nNestle:  Well, they were members of the Communist Party, although very low-level members, so they were very involved in political activity, but at a very low level.  So they were never threatened or involved in any of the stuff that came later.  And they didn’t get along very well, so there was a lot of fighting in the house all the time, and I was an only child, except that when I was ten years old, my mother adopted an eighteen-year-old.\n\tA couple of years later, I guess in 1946, right after the war, my father got a little money.  He had a job that paid and he bought a car, and we went across country and he visited his brother who lived in Los Angeles.  My father thought it was the Promised Land.  There were bananas growing on trees.  He just couldn’t believe it.  So two years later, we moved to Los Angeles, where he had a job, but that job fell apart quite quickly, and he died a year later, and my mother decided not to come back to New York.\n\nQ:  And you were how old when you moved out there?\n\nNestle:  Twelve.  And then he died the following year when I was thirteen, and my mother decided not to move back to New York.  The adopted eighteen-year-old, then nineteen or twenty, very quickly got married and moved out, and then my mother moved into some other place.  I survived, barely, junior high school and high school, and then I went to Berkeley.\n\nQ:  Were you going to public school the whole time?\n\nNestle:  Yes.  Well, the public schools were different in those days.  So I went to junior high school with movie stars.  There were movie stars who had kids in my class, and child actors were in my class, and they went to public school just like everybody else.\n\nQ:  What was the atmosphere surrounding food in your family?\n\nNestle:  Well, you know, there was food.  I don’t remember very much about it until I went to summer camp, and I went to summer camp in—I’m a little vague on exactly the years, but I think when I was eight, ten and twelve, or nine, ten, and thirteen.  I don’t have it quite right.  But the camp that I went to was run by a couple who had spent many years in China during the war, and before the war they ran a newspaper, an English-language newspaper in China, and they cooked Chinese.\n\nQ:  This was an American couple?\n\nNestle:  An American couple, and they were very interested in fresh local seasonal ingredients, and the camp had a vegetable garden.  If you were good, you could go out and pick vegetables for dinner, and my childhood memory of that was that it was revelatory.  You would go out and the green beans would be hot from the summer sun.  So when you put a hot green bean, one for the pot and two for me, and I just couldn’t believe that vegetables tasted like that.  I’d never tasted anything like it, and I was very, very impressed by that.  And then there were berries, wild berries, growing all over the place, blueberry, raspberries, blackberries, just all kinds of things, and we would go out first thing in the morning and pick berries, and then the woman who ran the camp—it was a very small camp—would turn them into berry pancakes and things like that.  And that established a taste for food that, you know, I kept looking to try to reproduce that.  I was very interested in food always, and I just loved going to this camp because I loved to eat what they had there, which was all fresh, everything fresh.\n\tThen when I went to college, by that time we had moved to Los Angeles and I went to college, and somebody who was a friend of my mother’s, who was a cookbook collector, suggested that I do something about studying food, but there were only two options.  You could go into agriculture or you could go into dietetics.  I was a city girl.  Agriculture was out of the question, and I didn’t get that agriculture had anything to do with food at all.  I mean, I just absolutely didn’t get it.  And dietetics, I was, “Well, what is a dietetics major?”  And I lasted precisely one day.  Precisely. \n\tI went to my first home economics classes, which is what they were, and I went to my first chemistry class, which was a chemistry class that was the same as the class that was taken with chemistry majors and pre-meds and other people like that.  I thought, “This is ridiculous.  If I’m going to be taking these classes, I’m not going to do home ec.”  So I ended up as a science major and dropped the food idea, and never really got back to it until I was teaching years and years and years later.\n\nQ:  It’s interesting to me that the food idea really took with you that early.\n\nNestle:  Oh yes.  I wish I had those books.  The library would love them.\n\nQ:  Do you have any idea why your imagination was caught up in it?\n\nNestle:  Well, it was something I liked.  I had no idea what I wanted to do, and I had no options.  Let me put it another way.  I didn’t think I had any options.  Nobody in my family had ever gone to college, so I was pioneer.  I got good grades in high school and junior high.  In high school it was clear I was going to go to college.  I went to a high school where everybody went to college, so that was what you did, and the girls went to college to get married.  That was what everybody did in those days.  I mean, we’re talking about the fifties.\n\tI had a few friends who had very clear ambitions.  There was one woman in my class who was interested in physics and wanted to study physics, but she ended up marrying a physicist and never did anything with it.  My best friends in high school, one of them wanted to marry a rabbi, one of them wanted to marry a scientist, one of them wanted to—I mean, they all did marry exactly who they wanted to marry, but none of them did anything.  And when I went back to my twenty-fifth reunion, there was only one other woman in the class with a Ph.D., and none of the others had jobs.  They were working with their husbands, and the average employment in the class was real estate agent.  This was in Los Angeles.\nSo I had no support or help for that.  I mean, I actually sent a query letter to Barnard and to Radcliffe about going to either of those, and was invited to a tea for the Seven Sisters colleges, and I went to it and I was excruciatingly uncomfortable.  I didn’t know what to wear.  I didn’t know what to say.  I didn’t know what to do.  And my mother said, “I’m not going to give you the money to apply to these places.”  It would cost twenty-five dollars to apply, and we had no money at all except for what I earned, you know, working in little jobs at eighty-five cents an hour.  She said, “I’m not going to give you the money.  I don’t want you to go to those places.  It’s cold in the East Coast.  You won’t like it.”\nAnd everybody in my school said, “Don’t go to the East Coast.  You won’t like it.\nIt’s cold.”  And there had been one person in the year before who had gone to Harvard and he committed suicide.  So Berkeley was as far as I could get to.  I applied to Stanford, but I didn’t get in.\n\nQ:  Let me just go back to the food for a second.  What was the food like at home?\n\nNestle:  It was okay.  It was standard home cooking.  I don’t remember anything particularly good, bad, or indifferent about it.\n\nQ:  And in terms of your parents’ attitudes, were they at all involved in weight issues?\n\nNestle:  My father was extremely fat, and the reason that he died at the age of forty-seven was that he was a 350-pound, three-pack-a-day smoker.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nNestle:  As we would say, multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease at a time when they didn’t know how to treat it.\n\nQ:  Is that one of the things your parents fought about?\n\nNestle:  Oh yes.  My father had lost a hundred pounds on somebody’s diet.  I don’t know what it was, but he lost a hundred pounds, and he went out to California and gained it all back, and we came out to California some months later to join him, and the first thing my mother said to him was, “Oh, you got fat again.  So, yes, it was one of the things that they fought about, but mostly they fought about money.\n\nQ:  In terms of your own eating habits, did his weight in any way affect your choices?\n\nNestle:  I don’t think so.  I don’t remember anything about it at all.  I mean, I weigh now what I weighed then.  I must be one of these people who really doesn’t put on weight very easily.  My father’s family had two kinds of physiology.  He had one sister who was also very fat, and the rest of them were okay and didn’t seem to have so much trouble with it.  But he also smoked this enormous amount.  I mean, he was a chain smoker.  So that combination is pretty deadly.  And he was five-ten, so he was enormously overweight and yo-yoing, going up and down and doing that kind of thing.  And there was a lot of stress in his life because he didn’t have a steady job, and he was married to somebody who yelled at him all the time.  I mean, that was kind of my memory of it.\nI actually don’t remember him very well, and Eva, the person that was adopted when she was eighteen and I was ten, said, “Well, of course you don’t remember him.  He was never there.”  So he wasn’t around much.  He supported the family.  I don’t know very much about that.  It seemed to be he would get jobs and get some money and spend it, and buy expensive or relatively expensive things, and my mother would go berserk.  But after he died, she had to go to work and was very resentful about it, because although she came from an abjectly poor family where there were five children, parents, and grandparents living in two rooms above a store in Newark, which was the family that she grew up in, she was very beautiful, and therefore must have been treated like a princess and thought she was a princess and thought the world owed her a living.  And was very, very resentful about having—had married my father because he had a steady job at the time, and thought that he would support her.  This is by her report.  I’m not making this up.  This is what she told me.\n\nQ:  It becomes reality in any case.\n\nNestle:  Well, this is what she told me when I interviewed her about that, and so she really resented having to work and also resented the fact that she had had to go to work right after she finished high school to support the family, because her older brother had gone to college and did not support the family when he was in college, although during the Depression he was a school principal, and he was the only one with a job and supported everybody.\n\tSo when she married my father, she stopped working, which she greatly preferred, and then had to go back to work.  She had a friend in Los Angeles who had a mannequin refinishing company, and she worked for him for a while, and then went to work for the Hain Celestial Foods at a time—\n\nQ:  How amazing.\n\nNestle:  Isn’t that amazing?  At a time when they were a big health food company.  We used to have a lot of avocado oil in the house and things like that, but I wasn’t interested in it at the time.  I just don’t remember much about food at all, except that it tasted good and I liked it.\n\nQ:  It’s interesting to me that you did decide to go into science when you got to college after that day with those first two classes.  Were there a lot of women at Berkeley in the sciences at that point?\n\nNestle:  No.  Very few, and I found it challenging.  You know, I had no idea what I could do and what I couldn’t do, and I had no idea what I was interested in, and I had had a lot of that beaten out of me growing up.\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nNestle:  This was the fifties.  You know, women had no options then, or if you thought you had options, it was because you came from a family—you know, all of the research shows you came from a family with a father who really supported you.  I didn’t have any support from my father.  He wasn’t around, and I had a mother who constantly said, “You can’t do this.  You can’t do this.  You can’t do this.  Girls don’t do this.  You’ll get into trouble.  Nobody will want to marry you.”  You know, that whole litany of things.\n\tSo I went to college and got married right away, to prove that I could.  So that was my trajectory.  I was married at nineteen.\n\nQ:  Oh my.\n\nNestle:  Oh my.  And so there I was in school, that was after my second year, and I went to eight weddings that summer.  All my friends got married in the summer between their sophomore and junior years.  I did too, and went to live in Monterey because my husband was in the army, and he was stationed at Fort Ord.  When I was at Fort Ord, I took science classes at Monterey Peninsula College, and I had a fabulous teacher, just the most amazing teacher, who just made me very excited about marine biology, particularly.  We were in Monterey; it’s got this wonderful marine life.  And I took every course this guy taught.\nWhen I went back to Berkeley the following year, I looked at what my credits were, and if I put all my science credits together, I could graduate most quickly in bacteriology, and that’s what I did.\n\nQ:  And you wanted to graduate quickly because?\n\nNestle:  I was bored.  You know, I was married.  I was bored.  I’d been in school too long.  I didn’t get it.  It didn’t seem to be leading anywhere.  I didn’t know what I wanted to do.  Nothing caught fire.  I didn’t know how to think about what I wanted.  So I went back and finished in bacteriology and then had kids.\n\nQ:  When you were studying bacteriology, did you think that there might be a job eventually one day that—\n\nNestle:  No.  I mean, I had very low expectations for myself.  So I was preparing myself to be a lab technician, and you could take all these courses and then qualify as a lab assistant or a lab technician, and as soon as I graduated, I went to work, interestingly enough, in the School of Public Health in Berkeley, in a laboratory that was studying western equine encephalitis, and I worked in the lab doing lab tests for western equine encephalitis.  I worked there for two years.\n\nQ:  Did you have any mentors throughout all that?\n\nNestle:  Never.  Never.  Never.  Never.  Other thing that happened was in my second year, my sophomore year, I took a public health class from the man who was then head of public health at Contra Costa County, another very dynamic, charismatic kind of teacher, and that class was so easy for me, so easy for me.  I didn’t have to do anything in it.  In fact, there was some guy I was interested in that I kind of liked and met him for coffee on the day of the final.  I came to the final an hour late, took the final, finished it in an hour, looked around.  Everybody else was still struggling, and I was done, turned it in, got an A on it.  Then after that, that instructor said, “You know, you really ought to go into public health.”  But it had been so easy, I thought if it was easy for me, it must be trivial, and somehow I never put together that it wasn’t so easy for other people.  It just never occurred to me that I had an automatic comfort with public health, that public health thinking was something that came naturally to me.  It just never dawned on me.\n\nQ:  Did it dawn on you that you had a very good mind?\n\nNestle:  No.\n\nQ:  Interesting.\n\nNestle:  No.\n\nQ:  And you didn’t think about it one way or another?\n\nNestle:  No.  It was a struggle.  I mean, everything was a struggle, and if it wasn’t a struggle, it didn’t mean anything.  It was like getting to a club that would take you in as a member kind of thing, and I had nobody saying to me—I mean, for example, the one that I look at is the crucial decision about where to go to college.  There was not one single person in my life, not anywhere, who said, “Why don’t you apply.  You know, just apply.  If you don’t get in, nothing’s lost.  If you do get in, then you can decide.”  Not one.  Not one person in my school, certainly nobody in my family.  Nothing but negatives.\n\nQ:  So why did you apply?\n\nNestle:  I didn’t.  I never filled out those applications to Barnard or Radcliffe.  I never filled them out.  My mother wouldn’t give me the money, so I would have had to pay for it myself.  I didn’t have a lot of money, and I got no support.  Absolutely none.  And I had no self-confidence.\n\nQ:  I was wondering how you could possibly.\n\nNestle:  How would I go to the East Coast and do this all by myself, even though I had loved New York and knew after my father died that we should move back to New York.  Many years later, I found letters that I had written saying, “Why don’t we go back to New York?  We really should go back to New York.”  I had very good instincts, very, very good instincts that life would be easier for the kind of person that I was in New York.  Not that Berkeley wasn’t wonderful; I had a great time there.  It was an easier place to grow up.  I mean, I don’t know what it would have been like to have gone to either Barnard or Radcliffe, but it would have been different.  You know, it would have been different.\n\tSo I ended up as a science major, worked for a couple of years, and then stayed home and had kids.\n\nQ:  Did you have any humanities courses in that mix?\n\nNestle:  Oh yes.  Loads.  Oh, loads.  Sure.  I sailed through Berkeley.  I was Phi Beta Kappa.  Again, never occurred to me that not everybody could do that.  I thought if I could do it, it probably didn’t mean much.\n\nQ:  That is pretty astounding.\n\nNestle:  I had nobody telling me.  I had no outside input whatsoever into this, and lots and lots and lots of criticism, lots of criticism at many different levels.  My husband wasn’t very useful through all of this.  So then I had kids and I stayed home for a couple of years and went insane.\n\nQ:  How many children do you have?\n\nNestle:  I have two.  I have two.  I read the Feminine—no, not that one.  What was the book that—\n\nQ:  You mean Betty Friedan?\n\nNestle:  No, before that.\n\nQ:  I don’t know before that, actually.\n\nNestle:  Simone de Beauvoir’s book.\n\nQ:  The Second Sex.\n\nNestle:  The Second Sex.  I read The Second Sex, and then in the middle of all of that, The Feminine Mystique came out, and so I was one of these people who was blown away by The Feminine Mystique. At that point I had a friend who kept saying, “Go back to school.”  I had one friend who said, “Go back to school.  Go back to school.  Go back to school.  Go back to school.”  And I picked molecular biology.\n\nQ:  For?\n\nNestle:  Because when I was a bacteriology major, I had had one professor who I thought was just the most brilliant man I’d ever met.  He was in molecular biology, and I thought that if he was in molecular biology, it must be worth studying, and that’s what I did.  So I did molecular biology for the next five years, once again, never taking myself seriously because when I applied to the program, I had very good grades as an undergraduate, and the faculty advisor, who I think would die if I told him this, he would deny it to his dying breath, said, “Well, you have a fellowship, and we’ll give you a fellowship, but that’s because this is the first year of this new program and no men have applied.  But as soon as a man comes in, we’re going to take your fellowship away and give it to a man.”\nSo I thought, “Okay.  I’m here on borrowed time.  They’re not going to take me seriously.  I’m not going to take myself seriously.”  And I picked somebody who seemed relatively easy to work with.  I got my degree in five years, which was pretty normal.  I have a few papers from it.  And then in the middle of all that, life got much more complicated.\nBut twenty years later, I saw my faculty advisor at Berkeley for the first time after a twenty-year gap.  There was a dinner party and he spent the dinner party telling everybody what an absolutely extraordinary student I had been.  I wish he had said something like that to me when I had been in his lab.  But that’s the story of my life, is nobody ever said it.  Ever.  Nobody ever said it.  So I had no reason to think there was anything special at all.  I had no reason whatsoever.  It took years.\n\nQ:  How did studying all that mesh with taking care of your family?\n\nNestle:  Oh, I did it part-time.  You know, in those days women didn’t work, and so I was right at the leading edge of women going back to the work force, and I was able to use my NIH fellowship to pay for it.  It went totally for a babysitter, and then my husband made enough money to support the two of us, but you could live on practically nothing then.  You know, I mean, it cost nothing to live.  Rent was a hundred dollars a month, and if you made three hundred dollars a month, you could live very nicely.\n\nQ:  How did you know about the NIH fellowships?\n\nNestle:  They gave it to me in the department.  I didn’t have to apply for it.  They gave it to me.  They had a training grant, and so they had fellowships.  So, I mean, I never paid for my schooling, ever.  Everything was on scholarship all the way through.  My family had no money.  I mean, I went to undergraduate, oh, I made about three hundred dollars in the summer and my mother gave me three hundred dollars, and I had a three-hundred-dollar fellowship.  That took care of it as an undergraduate.  And then in graduate school I had fellowships all the way through.\n\nQ:  What was your family eating at that point?  What was your cooking like?\n\nNestle:  You know, I don’t remember much about it until the early sixties when my kids were very young.  I started [hanging around with] a group of other graduate students or sort of people who were foodies, and we did competitive home cooking.\n\nQ:  Interesting.\n\nNestle:  I mean seriously competitive home cooking, everybody making dinner parties to outdo what everybody else was doing.\n\nQ:  This was post-Julia [Child]?\n\nNestle:  It was just on the cusp, and then when Julia came out, we cooked from Julia.  We cooked from Julia.  Everybody did in this crowd.\nI had friends then who had grown up in a foodie family.  They were in a family where, when their daughters came home from school, they were given lobster and other kinds of exotics.  There were fresh vegetables, fresh ingredients, the whole works, and so I was kind of in that.  So we were doing a lot of very serious cooking, and I was a pretty good home cook.  But I was busy, and I didn’t want to spend a lot of time on it, so I specialized in things that could be done in a half hour that looked like they took much longer.\n\nQ:  Do you remember what some of them were?\n\nNestle:  No, not really.  I mean, I don’t know, but it mattered.  Then as my kids got older, they acted out their adolescent rebellion by becoming picky, and my son would never eat anything green, and my daughter became a vegetarian, and that was very, very difficult to deal with.\n\nQ:  Now you balance so many things in your life, I’m just wondering were you always disciplined in terms of a certain amount of time for your studies and for the things at home?  It’s a lot to manage, two kids and classes and—\n\nNestle:  Well, I was only gone five hours a day.\n\nQ:  But you still had homework.\n\nNestle:  I was very efficient.\n\nQ:  That’s what I’m asking.\n\nNestle:  Yes, I was very efficient.  I remember going to school for an eight o’clock [a.m.] physical chemistry class, and there was a guy in my class whose wife had just had a baby, and we used to compare notes on how little sleep we’d gotten the night before.  I had a six-month-old at that point, and I’d say, “Well, I got six hours last night, in three shifts,” that kind of thing.  So I was just very, very efficient about what I was doing.\n\nQ:  On purpose?  Knowingly?\n\nNestle:  Couldn’t do it any other way.\n\nQ:  So when did you do homework, for example?\n\nNestle:  Well, I couldn’t do it at home, because I learned early on that trying to work at home with kids was too stressful.  So I did it when I was in that five-hour period, whatever I had to do I did.  So you’re not in class for five hours a day.  But the babysitter came at ten and I went home at three.\n\nQ:  And how far away did you live?\n\nNestle:  It was Berkeley.  Everything was close.\n\nQ:  I see.  All of it in Berkeley.\n\nNestle:  Everything in Berkeley was very close, so that wasn’t a problem.  There was no big commute or anything like that.\n\nQ:  So you got your bachelor’s degree originally in ’59, is that right?\n\nNestle:  Yes.\n\nQ:  And then your doctor’s degree—\n\nNestle:  I was home with kids for two years, I worked for two years, and then I went to graduate school in 1963 and finished in ’68.  Those, of course, were the years of the Free Speech Movement and student protests.\n\nQ:  It was busy there.\n\nNestle:  It was busy.  It was busy, and I was never arrested because I had two kids to take care of.  I understood why women were not revolutionaries.\n\nQ:  I couldn’t understand what your thesis topic was.  I mean, I read the words, but I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nNestle:  Purification and properties of an extra cellular nuclease—\n\nQ:  So what was that about?\n\nNestle:  —Serratia marcescens.  It was a biochemistry project.  I was an early nucleic acid enzymologist before there were restriction enzymes, and anybody who does nucleic acid enzymology will break up and laugh hysterically at the mere thought.  So I purified an enzyme that was excreted by a bacterium called Serratia marcescens, which has the unusual property of being a gorgeous red color.  It’s just beautiful, and it’s a particularly stable enzyme so you could do everything at room temperature.  It was really easy to work with, and it was standard biochemistry. You extract the enzyme from the bacteria—actually [the bacteria just excrete the enzyme] so I just had to extract the enzyme from the broth in which the bacteria were grown. [The broth] was bright red. Then you had to purify the enzyme and test it on DNA and RNA to see how it worked, and that’s what I did.  I had two papers in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, which I thought nothing of.  It was this really boring biochemistry journal, but my thesis advisor twenty years later told me it was really impressive.\n\nQ:  And you did those papers because you were asked to or what?\n\nNestle:  Well, you always write up your research if you’re a graduate student.\n\nQ:  But you don’t always submit it to somebody for publication, do you?\n\nNestle:  Oh, of course you do.\n\nQ:  Always?\n\nNestle:  Well, if you want a career in science you do.\n\nQ:  Aha.  So let’s get back to that.\n\nNestle:  I could have had a job, see.  This was a job.  It was clear that if I had a Ph.D., I would get a job, that I would do a postdoc and then I would have a lab or I would work in somebody else’s lab.  I mean, this was to earn a living.\n\nQ:  And the postdocs were a necessity as well to earn a living?\n\nNestle:  You usually needed further training, and I had a postdoc arranged in a lab run by a man named Allan Wilson, who was an evolutionary biochemist, and a very well-known one.  I mean, that was the path not taken.  I didn’t do that because I got married again, and my husband had a job at Harvard, and we moved to Boston.\n\nQ:  When did you get divorced the first time?\n\nNestle:  [1966.]\n\nQ:  I mean how old were your kids, ballpark?\n\nNestle:  Three and five.  Three and five.  So ’66, maybe  We separated in ’66, and I met my next husband in ’68 just before I was finishing my degree, and we moved to Boston together and I got a postdoc at Brandeis, a rather unsuccessful one, and I worked in a lab there, but I had a fairly difficult time.  I never really realized why I was having such a hard time until the famous swimming pool incident, the epiphany.  When my kids were taking swimming lessons at Brandeis on a Saturday morning and one day there was a double swimming lesson for some reason, and I went to my lab and walked into my lab and everybody was there on a Saturday morning.  I had no idea.  I didn’t know everybody in the lab was there [on Saturdays].  The lab director, his wife, the technician, the graduate students, the other postdocs, everybody was there.  I had never been there on a Saturday morning, and even if I had wanted to be there on a Saturday morning, there was no way in the world I ever could have done it.\nAnd that was the end of my scientific career.  It ended that day, because it was perfectly clear to me that I couldn’t do it.  I had an offer to go work in David Baltimore’s lab.  He was somebody who later had a Nobel Prize.  But my husband said, “You can’t do that.  You can’t do that.  You’ll need to work twenty hours a day.  You can’t do that.”  And I couldn’t.  There was no way I could do that and take care of kids at the same time.  So I gave up any thought of a scientific career and I took a teaching job.\n\nQ:  Did you resent it at all?\n\nNestle:  I didn’t think I had any choice.  There just wasn’t any choice.  You know, there was absolutely no way that I could raise two children [and work 20 hours a day].  I should say my kids were at the age which I consider to be the most demanding, which is that seven to eleven age, when they’re too young to do anything on their own and they’re not old enough to be left, and they’re exploring.\n\tSo I would get called home by whatever the babysitting arrangement was, because my daughter stole something from the local drugstore.  My son set a fire to leaves behind the house.  My son pulled the pants down of the girl across the street, and her parents called the police.  My daughter got her fingers caught in a car door.  I mean, there was something every day, and there was no way that I could not be available to come home and deal with this stuff.  I mean, these were object lessons, teaching lessons, teaching kids about what you can and cannot do, socializing your exploring children.  So there was no way I could do it.\n\nQ:  Did you ask for a teaching job at Brandeis?\n\nNestle:  Yes.  I started looking for a teaching job, and I got one at Brandeis, and I got one, and what that did, it wasn’t any less work, but it allowed me to work at home and on my own hours, and make some of my own hours.  So I ran the pre-med lab class and taught undergraduate zoology and botany for five years.  I was teaching cell biology as a lecture course, and we had a rule in the department where you could not teach the same class more than three years, and you had to teach anything that was required by the department, regardless of whether you knew anything about it or not, and I was handed a nutrition course to teach.\n\nQ:  At what point was this?\n\nNestle:  This was in year eight, probably, of my Brandeis life.  It was in the last year I was at Brandeis, so the summer before my last year.\n\nQ:  Seventy-five, maybe.\n\nNestle:  That would have been ’75.  I was told I would be teaching nutrition the next year. \n\nQ:  Looking through Food Politics again, I didn’t read every word of it again, but just noticing what else was going on in the world at that point, I wondered if any of it had crossed your mind?  The Hunger in America.\n\nNestle:  No.  I missed that completely.\n\nQ:  I would think you would, actually.\n\nNestle:  I didn’t see it at all.  I’m not a television watcher anyway, but I didn’t see it until a few years ago.  The library has a copy.  It’s an extraordinary document.  I used it in class once.  I was aware of Jane Brody, who was starting to write for the Times.  I was aware of Linus Pauling and [Vitamin C and] the Common Cold, and I was aware of Diet for a Small Planet.  Diet for a Small Planet had an enormous impact.\n\tSo I was offered human physiology or human nutrition as courses to teach because students were asking for something human, and I picked nutrition because I thought kidney function was really hard, acid-based balance is really complicated, and I didn’t want to spend time doing that.  So I picked the nutrition class, and I thought, “Well, it’ll be interesting to read Linus Pauling and [Vitamin C and] The Common Cold and see if there’s anything to it,” and let students kind of go at that.\n\tI went to Harvard, where they were teaching nutrition, and I talked to Jean Mayer, not a very nice man, who later became president of Tufts, and he was appalled at the idea that somebody who didn’t know anything about nutrition would be teaching it.  That’s another story of my life.  But he told me what books they were using, and I got a copy of every nutrition book I could get my hand on.  I opened them all up to the page on which they listed human nutrition requirements, and guess what, none of them were the same.  They were all different.  I thought, “Isn’t that interesting.”\n\tSo I went to the library and I got the Recommended Dietary Allowance book, which is this little book that was published by the National Academies of Sciences that listed all the information, summarized the information that was known then about human nutrition requirements for specific nutrients.  I opened the book at random and I picked thiamine, you know, at random, and started reading it, and then I was in the library, and Brandeis library is really good.  I just went to the library and started pulling papers off the shelves, and the first paper that I read about thiamine… was a study that was done in a mental institution in the South, in which six young women were put on a thiamine-deficient diet, and one of the assays for thiamine deficiency was how well they cooperated with cleaning chores around the hospital.  I thought, “Ooh, isn’t this interesting.”  When they were absolutely adamant about not doing any more cleaning chores, that kind of correlated with low thiamine levels, and they started giving them more thiamine back in the diet, and they started being willing to clean around the hospital again, and then everything was fine until they were told they couldn’t leave the hospital until they finished the study, and then they got all upset.  I thought, “This is amazing.”\n\tSo then I opened [the RDA book] to Vitamin C, and the first paper I pulled was a study done on six prisoners in a Kansas State penitentiary; maybe it was Iowa.  During this study, same study, put them on a Vitamin-C-deficient diet, but during the study two of the prisoners escaped.  So this raises the question, how well controlled is this study?\nI was hooked.  I was completely hooked.  I thought, “This is amazing.”  Because I had been teaching cell biology to undergraduates, which is so abstract and difficult for undergraduates to grasp.  This anybody could get.  You could give any student this paper and ask them what alternative hypothesis can you suggest for the results of this study, and they would all be able to think of problems with the study.  So it would be a great way to teach critical thinking in biology to undergraduates who might not know anything about science.  This would be a terrific way to teach science to undergraduates.  So that’s what I did.\n\nQ:  So you were teaching science and you started teaching nutrition when that option came up?\n\nNestle:  I had a nutrition class.  I was still running the lab class, and then I ran this lab class and then I ran one lecture class.\n\nQ:  And the lab class was about?\n\nNestle:  It was this undergraduate class, the undergraduate lab for pre-med students.  I was on the pre-med committee and did all that stuff, and the lab class was undergraduate biology, zoology, and botany.\n\nQ:  What was nutrition at that point?\n\nNestle:  There wasn’t any.\n\nQ:  So how did you teach a nutrition class?\n\nNestle:  Well, I had these books.  So I had these books, and what I was most interested in teaching was critical thinking in biology.  So I gave students original papers to read.  I had them as their term project go out and read some book like Vitamin C and the Common Cold and do the research on it, and write a paper on whether they thought the research backed up the contention.  There were fifty people in the class, and it didn’t matter what they were reading or what they were writing their papers about; the papers were identical.  They all said, “Two few subjects, not enough research, inadequately controlled, much too much anecdotal evidence and not nearly enough real science.”  And that kind of informed my thinking about the field right from the beginning, and I had these fifty review papers of probably thirty different topics.  So that started—I mean, I had in-depth reviews of the kind of thing that I was interested in on thirty different topics.  They were very good papers.  In those days, students could write research papers.  They can’t now, but they could then, and they were very well trained to do that.  So they wrote really good papers.  I learned a lot from them.\n\tThen they liked the class so much that twenty of them wanted to take it again, and so I ran an advanced section the next semester, and there I started getting into agriculture issues.  I went back and looked at my reading list for that, and I was surprised to see that I had given out a set of essays in the New York Review of Books written by a man named Geoffrey Baraclough, that talked about the relationship of food to the economy, to climate change, if you can believe it, because we’re talking about the mid seventies.  And so there all that stuff was, and those were the kinds of issues that we were talking about in that class, and that completely informed the way that I think about these issues.\nSo right from the beginning I was starting to begin to see how the agricultural system related to economic issues, political issues, nutrition and health issues, and they were all very tightly linked, and the students who took that class were reading about that.  We read Diet for a Small Planet and some of the other books.  Oh, and there was this terrific book that Michael Jacobsen and somebody on his staff had written, which was a compendium of readings that came out in about 1975 on agriculture, food, nutrition, and health issues, way, way ahead of its time. [Food for People, Not for Profit, edited by Catherine Lerza and Michael Jacobson].\n\nQ:  What was he doing then?\n\nNestle:  He was head of Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n\nQ:  Back then, yes.\n\nNestle:  Yes.  I mean, there he was doing that, and this book was just terrific.  That was our main text for the course, and they read the whole thing.  So they got the whole picture from agriculture to food, to nutrition and health, and with all of the politics thrown in.\n\nQ:  But was there any standard or basic syllabus that other people used for nutrition courses?\n\nNestle:  Oh, there probably was, but I didn’t know what they were.  I didn’t have any idea what they were.  I made up my own.  I was teaching critical thinking in biology, that’s what I was teaching.  This was a course not necessarily for majors, although most of the students in the class were biology majors, but there were others who weren’t.  I didn’t expect them to have a big science background in order to be able to do that, but they needed to read these papers and decide whether the research really backed up what was being said.  Well, I thought that was really worth teaching.\nAnd then another big life change.  My husband got a job in San Francisco, so at the end of that year, we moved to San Francisco.\n\nQ:  Before you move, let me just ask you, it’s interesting that you were interested in teaching critical thinking.\n\nNestle:  Well, that’s what you learn in molecular biology school.  What you learn in molecular biology school is to think of alternative hypotheses to account for the results that you get, and to the extent that you can criticize your own experiments, you’re doing a good job.  Otherwise, you get creamed.  If you present your work to your peers or to your instructors, the first thing they’re going to do is look for alternative hypotheses.  So you need to control for those and you need to think through what those controls would be.  So you’re always critically thinking about your own work.  That’s what you learn how to do.  I learned it really well.  Useful skill.\n\nQ:  Who was funding the few nutritional studies that there were?  I mean the prison one or—\n\nNestle:  I think those were probably government-funded studies in those days.  I think.  I don’t remember.  They didn’t declare funding sources in those days, so, hard to know.\n\nQ:  But the impetus was there to discover some of these things?\n\nNestle:  Well, because they were interested in human nutrition.  So these studies were designed to determine standards for food consumption, to evaluate whether the population was deficient or getting enough of different kinds of nutrients.  This was the golden age of nutrition research, in the forties, fifties, sixties.  So there was lots of research going on in nutrition departments and lots of interest in vitamins and minerals and all of these kinds of things.\n\nQ:  What kind of students were attracted to it?\n\nNestle:  Well, they were biology students who were interested in human biology.  They were interested in themselves.  They were just the kind of students who are interested in it now.  So this seemed closer to their own lives than cell biology, which is miserably abstract.  You start talking to people about cell biology and their eyes glaze over.  You talk to people about food, everybody is interested in food, everybody eats.  So it was fun to teach, and I had a great class, an absolutely great class.  They were really interested.  They felt like they were pioneering.  It had never been taught before, and it was fun.  You know, it was really interesting and fun.\n\nQ:  By then did you have any sense of your capacity as a teacher?\n\nNestle:  Well, I was getting there.  I was getting there.  I was teaching and getting reasonable evaluations, and very involved with students in a way that’s no longer the case, alas.  So, yes, and also I was learning on my own.  So what I was learning how to do was to sit down and read vast amounts of material and try to put it into a coherent way that students could understand, and I had been doing this for five or six years by the time.  I was into this.\n\nQ:  That’s a very difficult skill to—\n\nNestle:  It’s my skill.  It’s my skill, is to be able to read lots and lots of stuff and put it together in a way that is very honest about the science, but also simple enough for people to understand.\n\nQ:  And synthesizes it in that way.\n\nNestle:  And synthesizes it.  Yes, that’s my skill.  And I was doing that when I was writing, and also I was learning because I was running a lab course.  The skill in lab courses is to be very precise.  First you turn on the computer.  Oh, that I wish people who wrote computer manuals would learn what I had to learn.  Oh, that I wish.  How do you turn it on?  That’s the first thing you have to do.  So that I was very, very good at writing lab manuals that gave step-wise instructions to students that they could actually follow and do the experiments unambiguously, and have the experiments come out.  So I was good at that.\n\nQ:  And did you know that?\n\nNestle:  Oh, I could see that.  Yes, I could see that.  I was doing it all the time.  I ran that class for five years.  By the time I was finished with it, I was bored to death with the class, but the lab manual was really good.  It was really good.  It makes me very impatient with computer manuals.\n\nQ:  Now you’re faced with going back to California.\n\nNestle:  So here we go to California.  Right.  Different husband, different life, and—\n\nQ:  Wait a minute.  What do you mean, different husband?\n\nNestle:  Well, I had gotten married again.\n\nQ:  But this is the second husband.  Yes.  Right.\n\nNestle:  I got married again, and we were in California, and I had a job as associate dean in the medical school in San Francisco, which sounds very fancy, but, in fact, was quite meaningless.\n\nQ:  Was it difficult to get that job?\n\nNestle:  I got it because I was his wife.\n\nQ:  And he was?\n\nNestle:  He was going as head of the neurobiology department.  He was a lab scientist and was going to have a great scientific career, it looked like, or certainly he had a great scientific career as a scientific administrator.  He ended up as head of an NIH institute at one point.  He’s retired now.\n\tBut I went there as his wife, and that was a big problem, although I didn’t realize what a big problem it was at the time, and I was given a title as associate dean, without any line responsibility, and I was the only woman associate dean of eighteen associate deans in this huge medical center.  I taught nutrition half-time to medical students, and on the other half I ran the M.D./Ph.D. program.  That’s what I did.\n\tSo I had to learn clinical nutrition in order to teach medical students, and so that again meant reading vast amounts of material and putting together lectures for medical students.  I had a group of lectures in the first-year biochemistry class, I ran the first-year biochemistry class for a while, and then went on, and I don’t know, my job kept shifting around and eventually it all fell apart.\n\nQ:  Was that part of the job that you got because of your husband?\n\nNestle:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Who constructed that job?\n\nNestle:  The dean of the medical school.\n\nQ:  But presumably according to your own skills at that point?\n\nNestle:  Yes.  They looked and they had had students sitting in in the dean’s office wanting a nutrition class.  I was teaching a nutrition class.  Here again, same sort of thing, I went to Berkeley to meet with the people in the nutrition department and to talk to them about how I was going to be teaching nutrition in the medical school, and, you know, did they have any advice.  Doris Calloway, who was then head of the nutrition department at Berkeley and is since deceased, and was my partner’s sister-in-law, deceased sister-in-law—it’s quite funny—said, “I can see, since they hired you, that they’re not interested in teaching nutrition at the medical school.” [She was married to Robert Nesheim, my partner Malden Nesheim’s older brother].\n\nQ:  What did that mean?\n\nNestle:  “Don’t call on us.”\n\nQ:  Oh my.  How did you interpret that?\n\nNestle:  That she was furious that she or her colleagues hadn’t been asked to teach nutrition at the medical school, and she wasn’t going to give me a break, which she never did until I was fired, and then she did. [We served together later in the 1995 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which she chaired].\n\tSo I was not going to get any help from anybody at Berkeley, so I was on my own.  There were a group of students, the ones who were sitting in, and they met with me and they said, “We just can’t even tell you how disappointed we are that they hired somebody who didn’t know anything about nutrition to come in here and teach us.”\n\tAnd I said, “You know, I’m a very quick study, and I may not know a lot about nutrition, but I’m a quick study, and I’m really, really, really good at getting things done in institutions.  I really know how to do that.  So why don’t you just tell me what you want me to teach.”\n\nQ:  This was before you had constructed the course?\n\nNestle:  Yes.  I said, “Why don’t you just tell me.”\n\nQ:  And what did they tell you?\n\nNestle:  They told me how to do it.  I did exactly what they told me.  Precisely.\n\nQ:  What kinds of things had they been wanting that weren’t taught at that point?\n\nNestle:  They wanted basic information about nutrition applied to clinical practice.  What are the major nutrition-related problems that patients have, and how do you deal with them?  So that’s what I did.  It wasn’t all that hard.  So I gave lectures on nutrition and heart disease, nutrition and cancer, nutrition and bone disease, da, da, da, da.  I ran lecture series.  I had lectures within the first-year biochemistry class, which was mostly biochemistry and what the different nutrients did.  Then I had a public lecture series that used to get four hundred people coming to it.  I would bring in outside lecturers or I’d do the lectures.  I thought I was much better at them than the outside lecturers.\nI worked very closely with these students, and we constructed a third-year clinical elective.  So I ran a third-year clinical elective. [One of my students was] Richard Carmona, who was the last surgeon general who was in [the George W. Bush administration].  That was amusing.  So by the time I left, I did grand rounds, I did ward rounds. I would go on the wards with family practice residents and talk about nutrition problems on the wards.  I mean, by the time I finished there, I knew a lot of clinical nutrition, really a lot.  So I had already had the basic science.  I learned clinical nutrition, and then I was sort-of fired, when things got really, really bad.\n\nQ:  What happened?\n\nNestle:  Well, a new dean came in, who thought that having somebody’s wife as associate dean was pretty ridiculous, and what did I do anyway, and there was no way in the world I could explain to him what I did that was useful.  So he did things like he kept moving my office further and further away, and finally there was a big blow-up, and finally somebody told me what I had to do.  Finally I acquired a mentor, finally, and that was Phil Lee, who was the head of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at UCSF at the time, and had been an assistant secretary for health, and became assistant secretary for health again in the Clinton administration.  He said, “You have to resign.  There’s a new dean.  He gets to choose his own senior staff.  You have to resign.”  That made me cry, because what was I going to do?  And he said, “Here’s how you do it.”  He said, “Go tell him that you’ll be gone in two years if he’ll support you for two years.”  And he said, “I think you should go back to school and get a master’s in public health.”\n\nQ:  Before you did that, during this period of time when you were teaching, did you publish papers of some of the things that—\n\nNestle:  Very little.  Very little.  A few things.  Book reviews, a few review kind of things, very, very little.  I wasn’t doing research.  And the new dean, when he came in, said, “I don’t understand.  You don’t have a medical degree and you’re not doing research.  What are you doing here?”  It was a good question.  So there was very little publication, and when I was fired or when things got so bad that I resigned, I was forced to resign, basically, I wrote a book.\n\nQ:  But did you take his advice about going back [to school]?\n\nNestle:  Oh yes.\n\nQ:  And how long did that work?\n\nNestle:  It was a year.  I did it in a year.  It was actually thirty-six credits in a year, and some of them I never finished, but never mind.  [laughs]  Never mind.  The faculty signed off on it.  And then on the basis of that and with Phil Lee’s help, I got the job in Washington, and went to Washington as a senior nutrition policy advisor.\n\nQ:  Explain that job, how they knew about you.\n\nNestle:  Which job?\n\nQ:  In Washington.\n\nNestle:  Oh, that was Phil Lee.  That was Phil Lee.  First of all, my marriage broke up at the same time all of this was going on, so that was also very difficult.  So I went back to school.  I wrote this book.\n\nQ:  And which book was that?\n\nNestle:  This was Nutrition in Clinical Practice, which came out in 1985.  I did the public health degree.  I went to Southeast Asia over the summer to do my [public health school field work].  That was when I thought, “Ah, life is going to get better.”  I was in Southeast Asia the whole summer, teaching a class in Shanghai, and doing this project for AID in Bangkok and Jakarta.\n\nQ:  How did those things come about?\n\nNestle:  When I interviewed for jobs in Washington, I met the AID nutrition person [Marty Forman] and I told him I was interested in international nutrition.  He said, “That’s ridiculous.  You don’t have any experience.”\n\tI said, “I’ve got ten weeks this summer and I have to do block fieldwork, and I’ve got a salary,” because the university was still paying me.  I said, “I have a salary.  Why don’t you give me some experience?”  And he, for reasons that I never understood, sent me on a consult to Bangkok and Jakarta.  I had a great time, learned a lot.\n\nQ:  Your children were how old at this point?\n\nNestle:  By this time they were in college.  They were on their own.\n\nQ:  And why were you looking for a job in Washington?\n\nNestle:  I wasn’t.  I couldn’t get a job in San Francisco.\n\nQ:  I see what you mean.\n\nNestle:  There were no jobs in San Francisco.  I had to leave the medical school.  You know, when my marriage broke up, there was no reason for anybody to keep me.  I couldn’t keep the job in the dean’s office because the new dean couldn’t see any reason to have me there and really didn’t understand what I was doing.  He apologized to me a year or so later, but at the time he wanted to put in his own people.  He had the right to do that.  It was like politics, like a political appointee.  I was a political appointee, but I was the only one of the eighteen associate deans who did not have tenure.  I was the only untenured one and I was the only woman.  So I was in a very awkward position.\nWe should go back.  Remind me to tell you about the women’s thing at Brandeis, because I was involved in a case.\n\nQ:  Well, let’s talk about that now, then, as long as we’re on this track.\n\nNestle:  You want to go back?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nNestle:  The women’s stuff was there, and when I was at Brandeis I got a call one night from a friend of mine in Boston who was in a women’s group.  This was the era of women’s consciousness-raising groups.  She called and said, “Guess what my consciousness-raising group talked about last night?”\n\tI said, “What did they talk about?”\n\tShe said, “We talked about your salary at Brandeis.”\n\tI said, “Explain, please.”\n\tAnd she said, “Well, Jonny Kabat-Zinn’s girlfriend, Myla, is in my [consciousness-raising] group, and she came in and said, ‘I know something that I don’t know what to do with, and that is that my boyfriend, who has just gotten a job at Brandeis, is getting 25 percent more salary than Marion is, even though they’re doing exactly the same job, because he negotiated for it.’”\n\nQ:  Ah.\n\nNestle:  So I said, “Thank you very much,” and called the guy.  He’s also become this great health guru, Jonny Kabat-Zinn.  He’s a great guy.  I called him.  He confirmed it, and I went to see the chair of the department the next day, and said, “I understand you’re paying him twelve thousand, and I’m only getting nine.”  And the chair of the department got furious, and I said, “I have to tell you.  I don’t want to make a federal case of this.  Fix it.  I do not want to make—.”  That was my mantra for the next year.  “I do not want to make a women’s case of this case.  I do not want to make a case of this.  Fix it.”  And it took a year.\n\nQ:  Why didn’t you want to?  You didn’t want to use your energy that way?\n\nNestle:  Oh, I could see what happened to people who were doing cases, and in any case, I thought this one was so clean.  This was so clear and so clean.  I had had more experience than he had.  We were equivalent in the jobs that we were doing.  Neither one of us had a research lab.  We were both teaching.  It was perfectly clear.  He had told the department chair that he and Myla intended to have children, and that was why he needed more money.  I had two children.  The chair of the department said, “But you’re married.”  And I knew that I had everything on my side, that this was clean as a whistle, there wasn’t anything ambiguous about it, and that I was going to win this.  I knew I was going to win it.\n\nQ:  Did other people know you were doing this?\n\nNestle:  Oh, sure.  Oh, sure.  I mean, eventually it went through all—then the chair changed, and I had to do it again with the new chair.  It went to the dean.  Same mantra.  “I don’t want to take this to the Affirmative Action Committee.  I don’t want to have to make a court case out of this.”  And women were winning court cases in those days and they could see.  So at the end of the year, I got a salary increase.  I got a retrospective raise.  I got $500 a year more than him and I got a better title, and that was very important to me.  So I had a title as assistant professor instead of instructor or lecturer or whatever I was.\nSo that made it easier to get the job in San Francisco, and in San Francisco, after everything fell apart, I hadn’t had a merit increase for a while.  I was then in the family practice department, the family medicine department, and I asked the chair of that department if he would put me up for a merit increase, and he said, “Oh, I’m going to do much better than that; I’m going to put you up for a promotion.”\n\tSo I left UCSF as what was an adjunct associate professor, with adjunct having a very different meaning there than it has here at NYU.  It was a full-time job there, but that made it possible that when I came to NYU they could give me a full professorship because I had been an associate professor in my previous job.  So all of that worked out okay in both cases, but those were my women’s battles.  I keep forgetting about them.  Look what you’re reminding me about.  This is so much fun.  I haven’t thought about this stuff in years.\n\nQ:  Can we talk about the HHS job?\n\nNestle:  Yes.  So that came about because when I was in public health school, I was looking for a job, and there was nothing on the West Coast, and I was heartbroken at having to leave.  My kids were there, my friends were there, my lifetime friends, and the thought of taking a job someplace else was really terrifying.  I interviewed in Utah.  I can’t remember where I interviewed.  I interviewed at a bunch of places and just couldn’t imagine.\nAnd finally Phil Lee said, “You know, you really ought to talk to Mike McGinnis at HHS.  He’s got a big project coming up that I think you’d be perfect for.”  And so he arranged for me, when I was at the public health meetings in Washington, to meet with McGinnis, and then at the same time that was when I met with the guy from AID.\n\tSo I was hired to edit the “Surgeon General’s Report on Nutrition and Health,” which was a project that they were working on, right after I had just published a book on nutrition and everything for medical students.  So, in fact, I was really qualified for this.  I have famous stories about that too.  I read some of the chapters that had been prepared on my way moving to Washington, and came into the office on the first day and said, “What do I do with these?  They’re really awful.  There’s no public health in them.  They’re unreadable, and they don’t really talk about what the important issues are.”\nHe’s a very unusual man, Mike McGinnis, and so his reaction to that was not, “Oh, tell me what’s wrong with them,” but, “How dare you suggest that anything is wrong with these when you don’t know anything.  When you’re here for a while, we’ll have this discussion, and in the meantime, let me tell you that I just want you to write the policy parts of this, and let me tell you right away that this report will never say ‘eat less meat,’ because that would cause too much trouble.”  That was my first day in Washington, and I couldn’t go back.  I’d burned all my bridges.  My stuff was in a truck being moved across country.\n\nQ:  You also described the things that you learned right away you could not say.\n\nNestle:  Yes.  You couldn’t say “eat less meat.”  Right.  You couldn’t say eat less of anything.  You couldn’t say eat less of anything.\n\nQ:  How was that made known to you?\n\nNestle:  Oh, he said it directly.\n\nQ:  And what did you say?\n\nNestle:  I said, “Oh.”  It was my first day on the job.  I had just moved from California.  My things were in a truck.  I didn’t have anyplace to live because my apartment wasn’t ready.  I was living in a hotel [The Tabard Inn].\n\nQ:  The parameters of the surgeon general’s report at that point—\n\nNestle:  It had been in the works for two years, and it had gone through at least two project officers, at least two.  Both failed.  It was under enormous pressure because nobody wanted it.  It was going to cause nothing but trouble.  The individual agencies of the government had written the various reports, and depending on how seriously they took it, they either had good people or terrible people write it, and many of the reports were written by researchers who had very narrow focused areas, like Vitamin A deficiency in rat’s teeth, for example, was one of the ones that leaps to mind.  There was this collection of papers.\n\nQ:  What was the impetus for it in the first place?\n\nNestle:  There had never been a report on diet and chronic disease risk, and the history was that in the mid 1970s a Senate committee had come out with the report, “Dietary Goals for the United States,” that talked about diet and chronic disease risk.  It was very controversial.  The idea that you needed to lower saturated fat and cholesterol and sugar and salt was very controversial, and there was a lot of argument in the nutrition field about those kinds of recommendations, and so the person—who was running the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion [Mike McGinnis]—he’s still alive, but a very difficult person to work for, but very good at getting things done and hires really good people, and identifies very important problems—had figured out that a research report that would summarize the research would calm down some of these things and allow everybody to move forward to try to improve the health of the public and so forth.  I mean, his mantra was always “We want to make people healthier.  We want to improve the health of the American public.”\n\nQ:  Was he a career person?\n\nNestle:  Yes, a very unusual person.  He’d been head of that office through several political administrations, and he was a political appointee in the Public Health Service.  Interesting guy, very talented in a lot of ways, but not much fun to work for.  So it was a while before—\n\nQ:  To whom would this be disseminated, the final report?\n\nNestle:  Oh, everybody.  I mean, it’s a great big book.  I’ve got a copy of it here.\n\nQ:  But the intention was to produce this—\n\nNestle:  To set policy.\n\nQ:  To set policy and make it available to anybody who wanted it?\n\nNestle:  To anybody who wanted it, and, in fact, there were a couple of additions that came out as books for the general public, but it was designed to push nutrition policy in the direction of healthier eating.\n\nQ:  And the impetus for that came from?\n\nNestle:  Well, there had been a lot of previous reports that were very controversial, and so this was to summarize the research base.  It made a lot of sense, and the National Academy ended up doing exactly the same thing a year later.  So two reports came out at exactly the same time, and there was a third one that was done in Europe.  So three reports came out.  In 1988 and 1989, three reports came out, all saying exactly the same thing, all with the exactly the same message.\n\nQ:  Which was?\n\nNestle:  Eat less fat.  Those were the “eat less fat” days.\n\nQ:  And it made no distinctions between the kinds of fat or not much?\n\nNestle:  Well, the idea was that if you ate less fat, because meat and dairy products were the major sources of fat, that you would automatically reduce your saturated fat and calories.  Nobody, nobody, nobody suspected that the food industry would then make low-fat products that were full of sugars, and that people would think that those were license to eat more calories.  I mean, so I think they were naïve.  They weren’t stupid; they were naïve.\n\nQ:  So what did you do every day during this period of time?\n\nNestle:  I wrote this book.\n\nQ:  From the papers that had been amassed?\n\nNestle:  Yes, and eventually I rewrote the papers.  Eventually.  I organized a read-in in the office that I was in.\n\nQ:  What was that?\n\nNestle:  Well, I asked people in the office if they would help me with this problem that I was having with this guy that we all worked for, and they all offered to help.  They said, “Why don’t you let us read the chapters.”\nSo I distributed all of the chapters to individuals, with no instructions.  I said, “Just give me comments.”\nAnd every single one of them said the same thing: “This isn’t about public health.  It’s way too specific.  It’s not written for a general audience.  It needs a complete rewrite.”\nSo I put all that together and handed it to him, and he was furious, and said, “How dare you do this subversive thing.”  And then eventually he came around and said, “Okay, rewrite it.”\n\nQ:  Could you assign other chapters or get other—\n\nNestle:  Oh no.  I did the whole thing.  No, everybody else had other things to do.  I did the whole thing.  A couple of the chapters were okay.  The cancer and heart disease chapters didn’t need any work.  The way that we did it was we worked out a format.  So the chapters had to be fit into a format, and because of that, that gave a lot of license to write, but there were some that I wrote from scratch.  But I had just written a book.  You know, I had all the information at hand.  I had everything I needed to do it.\n\nQ:  How do you actually store your notes from various projects?\n\nNestle:  They’re behind you in those file cabinets.  And now they’re online.\n\nQ:  Your very own notes are online?\n\nNestle:  Well the documents.  I don’t do notes; I do documents.  For years I’ve kept files of “nutrition and.”  And I often don’t look at them, but then if I need them, there they are, and so the papers are all there.  I mean, right now, I’ll give you an example, I’m writing a column for the San Francisco Chronicle, and it’s a Q and A, and the last Q was on gluten intolerance.  Well, I don’t really remember much about gluten intolerance, but I’ve got a file on it, and now, of course, everything is online, so it’s real easy to do this kind of research.  I just went right to my file and there was everything I needed.\n\nQ:  You started those files approximately when?\n\nNestle:  When I was at Brandeis, and certainly when I was at UCSF.  When I was at UCSF and preparing lectures on heart disease, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, I accumulated.  I read everything that there was to read on those things.  So I had all those papers filed in some reasonable order, and then at some point, probably ten years ago, I had a research assistant to reorganize the files and we threw out a lot.  I’m trying not to use them so much anymore, because I’m trying to use my blog as a file cabinet, because it’s time-consuming.\n\nQ:  Time-consuming to use them?\n\nNestle:  To tear out articles.  It’s much quicker to have a file than to look it up online.\n\nQ:  I would think, yes.\n\nNestle:  It’s much quicker, but the filing process is very cumbersome, and there’s a limit to how many file cabinets you can have, and each new topic requires a huge—you know, the pet food book has four or five file boxes full of materials.  Most of those are stored up in Ithaca so I don’t have to deal with them here.\n\nQ:  What was your confidence level at that point, when you were in Washington?  How did you see yourself?\n\nNestle:  Well, I could see that I was the ideal person to do this job, and there was really nobody else who had that kind of generalist overview of all of these topics, where I could read one of these chapters and know in a minute whether they had read the right literature or not.  So then I knew that I was the right person for this job, but I spent at least a third of my time fighting with my boss, who was in my way all the time. I mean, it was inexplicable.  Everybody else in the office had the same problem, but mine was the hot-seat project during the period that I was there, so it was difficult.  It was another difficult situation where I was constantly being torn down and argued with.  It was very nice to come to NYU.  It really was.\n\nQ:  I bet.\n\nNestle:  At long last.  Not that the department was any different.  Oh, my god.  Is anybody going to read this?  Not that the department was any different, but it was all right.  It was okay.  I was the boss.  It made a big difference.\n\nQ:  When you were writing this, did you have a strong sense of yourself as a writer?\n\nNestle:  No.  I just knew that I wrote clearly.  And it was hard.  I learned how to write in that office.  Let’s give [McGinnis] credit for lots of things, this guy.  He really taught me how to write, because I would come in in the morning and there would be a little list of things on my desk saying, “Do this, this, this and this by close of business, COB, today.”  That meant five o’clock.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nNestle:  So I would sit down—that’s what staff in the government do—and so I would sit down and I would look at the list and I’d think, “This one is easy.  Let me knock it off first.”\n\tHe would come in fifteen minutes later and say, “Which one are you doing first?  I don’t want you to do them in that order; I want you to do them in this order.”  And at the height of my powers, at the real height of my powers, I could write a twenty-page testimony in a day on a subject I knew nothing whatsoever about, and the policy issues connected with it.  I could write speeches for the surgeon general, the assistant secretary for health, the secretary for health, and my boss.  In two days I could write speeches for both of them.\nOne of the most bizarre experiences of my life was going to the press conference on the release of the Surgeon General’s Report, and listening to C. Everett Koop channeling my words.  It was so weird.  It was so weird.  I thought, “If I had known he was going to read my speech word for word, I would have made it much tougher.”\n\nQ:  Did you mind doing those things?\n\nNestle:  Yes.  Yes, I didn’t like it at all.  I fled back to the university.  I fled.  I was in trouble all the time when I was in Washington.  I knew that there were things that I didn’t know about how to get this job done, but I didn’t know what they were, and nobody could tell me.  Nobody could tell me what I didn’t know.\n\nQ:  You mean strategic things or—\n\nNestle:  I didn’t know anything about what I had landed in the middle of, other than what people in the office could tell me.  So the only way that I thought I could get my job done was to let people know who I was and let them help me, and lots of people did.  I mean, it was a strategy that got me into trouble, but, boy, did it work.  It really worked.  People would come up after meetings and say, “I can see that you need help.  Here’s how I can help you.”  “Thank you very much.”  And, actually, I ended up at the end of those two years with only one thing I hadn’t known that I needed to have known, only one, and I thought that wasn’t so bad.\n\nQ:  And what was that?\n\nNestle:  I didn’t know that Koop had two staffs in two different places, and I had been terrific about keeping his downtown staff in the loop on absolutely everything, but I didn’t know about his other staff.\n\nQ:  Where was that?\n\nNestle:  Parklawn.  They found out very, very late in the game about a chapter that they were particularly interested in at a time when it was basically finished, and they were furious about something.  What they were furious about was something that I agreed with.  I thought they were absolutely right, and if I had known about it earlier, I could have done the chapter with that material in there.  It was an area I didn’t know very much about, and could have made it a much, much stronger chapter, but I didn’t know.  So there I was at war with them because this thing was supposed to go to press, and the press conference had been scheduled.  So there was a big kafuffle about it, and it all got worked out, but I could have headed that off if I had known that. \n\nQ:  When did you find out?\n\nNestle:  When they complained.\n\nQ:  Oh, I see.  All that said, it sounds like an extraordinary amount of work to get done in a relatively short period of time.\n\nNestle:  Yes.  I’m good at this stuff.  Efficient.  I also wrote fourteen papers while I was there.  I was so angry about the way I was treated, that whenever I had any spare time, I did my own work, and I was living alone.  I wasn’t dating.  I had plenty of free time when I wasn’t in the office.\n\nQ:  But you used it so productively, and by now you know that not everybody does that.\n\nNestle:  Yes.  Yes, but I needed a job, and I knew I wanted to go back to a university, and if I was going to go back to a university, I had to publish.  I already lost a job because I didn’t publish and I perished, and so I knew I had to publish.  So every opportunity that I had when I was in Washington, I published, and I came out of there with fourteen papers.  That was quite helpful.\n\nQ:  Do you have exceptional powers of concentration?\n\nNestle:  You know, I guess I do.  I can write on airplanes.  I can write in airports.  I can write on buses.  I just tune it all out, and I like it.\nOh, I never finished about how he taught me to write.\n\nQ:  Go ahead.\n\nNestle:  So the punishment for not finishing what you needed to do by close of business was much, much greater than the punishment for doing it badly.\n\nQ:  An important discovery.\n\nNestle:  An important discovery.  So it was much better to get it done badly by close of business than not to get it done.  So I learned how to write fast.  Remember these were the early days of computers.  When I came to that office, I would write everything out in longhand, type it into the computer, print it out, edit it, retype it, edit it, retype it, edit it, with printings in between.  When I left the office, I never used paper.  I was paper-free by the time I left the office.  So he taught me that fast was better than perfect.\n\nQ:  Did that bother you?\n\nNestle:  No, not at all.  I could see it was a great lesson.  It was a great lesson.  I could see that most of the work that I turned in was acceptable just the way it was, and that if it wasn’t acceptable, he would send it back.  And sometimes he would actually say what it was that wasn’t acceptable about it, and if he didn’t, you could go ask him, and say, “Could you give me a hint?”  And he would give you a hint maybe of what it was that wasn’t acceptable, and I could rewrite it.\n\nQ:  So how different would that work had been from the way you were proceeding before that?  In other words, to make it work that you thought was good.\n\nNestle:  I think I suffered over it a lot more.  I fussed with it a lot more.  The ability to write, I mean, one of the things that computers did was to give you the ability to edit constantly.  So to be able to edit and re-edit and re-edit and re-edit and re-edit, and every time you read it make changes, is just wonderful, to be able to move text around, to be able to do all that.\n\nQ:  You were doing that for the quality of the writing, to make it clear, what?\n\nNestle:  Yes.  Clarity.  Always clarity.  I don’t do anything style.  I’m not Michael Pollan.  Oh, how I wish.  You know, oh, how I wish I could write like that, but I don’t write like that.  I just try for clarity.  That’s all I do.  I think that nutrition is so confusing for people, and it’s so easy to write in passive voice and be ambiguous about who’s doing what to whom, that clarity is what really matters, and that’s all I try for.  I just don’t worry about style at all.\n\nQ:  What about the speeches?\n\nNestle:  Well, the speeches were in my voice.  I don’t know how to write any other way.  I really don’t.  So, you know, they covered different topics, but they’re all in the book and they’re all in the press kit, and there they were and everybody read them word for word.  I think Koop changed five words in the speech that I wrote for him.\n\nQ:  The presentation of material in speech form, though, is a little different from—\n\nNestle:  Well, I tried to write the way I thought he would talk.  I mean, for everybody in that.  It was an amazing experience.  I didn’t like it at all.  I’ve talked to speechwriters in Washington, and they love it.  They’re thrilled to see their words being mouthed by the president or some high official.  I would rather say it myself and take the consequences of it, because if I was saying it, I would make it much stronger.  Koop had said that he didn’t want to get involved in nutrition.  He did not.  He had too many issues on his plate.  HIV, that was his big one.  Smoking, a big one.  He was being harassed by Mothers Against Drunk Driving.  That was driving him nuts.  He didn’t want to get involved in nutrition.  He thought that was nothing but trouble.  He didn’t know anything about it.  He wasn’t comfortable with it.  He would speak at the press conference, provided he could walk out the door the minute his speech was over with, which is exactly what he did, and then everybody else took over.  But that was enough to give it surgeon general’s imprimatur.  It was very important, symbolic.  And I had an enormous amount of respect for him and everything that he did, and that was a terrific thing that he did.  It was sort of funny, because Malcolm Gladwell was the reporter who was covering all that.  It is sort of funny to think about that now.\n\nQ:  Had you signed a contract for a specific period of time?\n\nNestle:  I don’t think there was a contract.  I don’t remember.\n\nQ:  In other words, you knew that once this project was over, the job was over?\n\nNestle:  Yes.  There was talk in between about staying on for a period, but we just didn’t get along that well, and finally he said, “You’re just too difficult to work with.  Go away.”\n\tSo I said, “Fine.  I’m leaving.”  And then they were furious because I left before the end.  Actually, I had to stay.\n\nQ:  The end meaning?\n\nNestle:  Well, I had to stay until October 1st.  I wanted to leave at the beginning of September, when school starts.  So I started a month late, and that cost me a month’s salary here, and it meant I missed the beginning of the semester.  That turned out to be great because there was a strike and I was very happy to have missed that.  I came after the strike was over.\n\nQ:  How did you get this job?\n\nNestle:  I interviewed for it.\n\nQ:  The department existed at that point?\n\nNestle:  The department existed as Home Economics, and they had had an acting chair for three years, Judith Gilbride, who was an assistant professor.  What happened was, there was a previous chair who had been chair for twenty years of the Department of Home Economics, and she took an early retirement when they did a buyout.  There was a buyout.  There were big financial problems in the late eighties, and she took a faculty buyout, as did a couple of other faculty members, and there was nobody left to chair except an assistant professor.  Not a nice thing to do to an assistant professor, but she was good at it.\nThey had recruited somebody, Adam Drewnowski [as chair].  I mean, this is lost on everybody, but he’s now the chair of the department in Seattle, and at the last minute he got a better job offer and he reneged.  So then the job was open again. By that time everybody knew I wanted to come to New York.  I had figured out fairly early on in my tenure in Washington that Washington was not—you know, the world divides into people who like Washington better than New York, and vice versa.  I had figured out really early on that I loved New York, and that I would be normal in New York and it would be a great place for me.  So I was looking for jobs in New York.\n\nQ:  But you hadn’t lived here since you were a kid.\n\nNestle:  No.  No, but I had a cousin who lived here on Christopher Street [Robert Moss] and I had a friend [Joan Pearlman] who had come down from Boston and had rented an apartment on Charles Street, but was living with her boyfriend [Peter Kivy] on 12th Street, and mailed me the keys to her Charles Street apartment, which she was not using.  So anytime I wanted to come, I had keys to a New York apartment on Charles Street in the West Village.  It was lovely.  So I could come anytime I wanted.  I came up here often.\nI started looking for a job right away and did a lot of interviewing around, and there was nothing, nothing, nothing, and then this job was advertised, and I must have had a stack this high on my desk of people who sent me copies of that job ad, saying, “Marion, here’s your job.”  And so I applied for it.\n\nQ:  How was the job described?\n\nNestle:  It was described as chair of the Department of Home Economics and Nutrition.\n\nQ:  In the school of?\n\nNestle:  In the school of what was then SEHNAP, the School of Education, Health, Nursing and Arts Professions.  I didn’t know what it was.  So I came up here and interviewed.  I was appalled.\n\nQ:  What were you appalled by?\n\nNestle:  How ugly the department was, the physical, how ugly the rooms were, how the department office was all different colors that didn’t match.  It seemed really disorganized.  I had asked for a description of every program in the department.  They were unable to give me one.  Nothing like that existed.  So I couldn’t figure out what the department did—in fact, it took me a year.  I was here for a year before I identified the last program that the department ran.\nWhen they brought me over to this building—it was in two buildings—when they brought me over to this building and I got off the elevator where the kitchen was, it smelled bad.  The entire floor smelled bad.  It had been a Home Economics department, and the floor in this building was an apartment.  So there was a living room, a dining room, and this unbelievably filthy kitchen, indescribably filthy.  It was green.  The kitchen was green, sort of 1950s green.  There was grease on everything.  There were many, many signs of wildlife, and in the living room the walls were lined with cabinets that had boxes with little squares of material in them that were covered with mouse turds, and there were locked cabinets lining the halls that were filled with magazines that dated back thirty years, also covered with mouse turds.  There were mice everywhere, signs of mice everywhere, and nobody seemed to mind or be the slightest bit concerned about it.  So that seemed bizarre.\nI sent in my application, and somebody from here came down to Washington and met with me in Washington, and recruited hard, and said, “This is a really exciting opportunity.  You have the opportunity to build a department.”  I mean, he was not lying.  “You have the opportunity to build the department.  The department is financially stable.”  That was also true, although I didn’t believe it.  “It really needs somebody to come in and bring it into the twentieth, if not the twenty-first century, and you’d be the perfect person to do it.”  So that was very good.\nSo I interviewed here a couple of times, and it had many things that I wanted, many things. [It was in New York]. It was the chair of a department.  It came with a full professorship.  It came with tenure.  Ooh, did I want that.  It came with a decent salary or what seemed like a decent salary.  It came with people who seemed to want to create something that was better.  So all of that was really good.  What was scary was the facilities, a faculty who seemed really passive and not very academically inclined.  That was a worry.  And then all this home economics stuff which was just weird.\n\nQ:  What about the students?  What kind of students?\n\nNestle:  I didn’t meet students.  I didn’t meet them.\n\nQ:  But as it turned out, what kind of students were—\n\nNestle:  Well, they were kind of passive too.  They were sort of passive.  Just everything seemed so disorganized to me, and dirty and unpleasant and unprofessional.  There was something very unprofessional about the whole thing.\nSo then I came, and they said at the last minute, when I met with the deans to negotiate salary and all of that other stuff, they said, “It’s not with tenure, and we’ll appoint you as an associate professor.  You’ll come up in a couple of years.”\n\tAnd I said, “You’ve got to be kidding.  You want me to come into a department that’s got three tenured associate professors in it and make changes in it?  There’s been a big mistake.  I would not have considered this without tenure,” and an hour later, whatever the problems about tenure was solved.  So I had a one-hour tenure battle.\n\tThen I called my old therapist in San Francisco and said, “What’ll I do?  This place is just a mess.”\n\tAnd she said, “Marion,” she said, “you never had security in your life.  This is security.  Tenure’s a really good thing.  I think it’ll be really good for you.  Why don’t you try it.  If you don’t like it, you can always leave.”  So I took it.  Turned out to be a great job.\n\nQ:  Before we get you to what that entailed and what you did here, I’m curious to know whether the experience in Washington politicized you about the issues in ways that you hadn’t thought about.\n\nNestle:  Well, I went to Washington not even knowing what I didn’t know.  I mean, I thought I knew about politics.  I was clueless, just clueless, and there were things that I was just naïve about.  I mean, my first week in Washington, I was sent off to meet the assistant secretary for agriculture, who was my nemesis during the entire time I was there, and she was this assistant professor from some dental school in the South, wearing a madras dress.  I mean, don’t I sound snotty?  So snotty.  And here she was in this enormous office with black leather furniture, Susie Harris, and I was kind of amazed.  Who is this woman?  So we were chatting, and I said to her, “It just seems everything is really strange to me here, but maybe it doesn’t feel strange to you.”  We had just both come.\n\tAnd she said, “Oh no.  My husband is the head of the Republican National Committee.”\n\tAnd I thought, “Oh, okay, that’s how Washington works.  That’s how Washington works.”\nAnd I didn’t really understand that Republicans played hardball.  I mean, that was another thing I didn’t understand.  So there was a situation in which I was going to a meeting in Berkeley and there was a meeting on food security, and my boss was really upset that nobody from the Department of Agriculture had been invited.  So I got a couple of people from the Department of Agriculture invited.  I went out there.  I gave my talk.  They told their boss what I said.  Their boss told my boss.  I was in so much trouble, you wouldn’t believe it.  I was in so much trouble.  My boss was furious at the kinds of things that I had said.  As it turned out, it was okay.  So I thought, “Ooh, they play rough.”\n\nQ:  What kinds of things were you talking about that he was upset about?\n\nNestle:  I walked into this meeting.  I wasn’t supposed to be there in the first place, which was a problem, but my mother had fallen and broken her hip, and I had to be on the West Coast anyway.  I snuck into this meeting.  I really wanted to go to it.  And the congressman who was supposed to give the opening address wasn’t there, so they said, “Marion, why don’t you give us a talk on what it’s like to be new in Washington.”  So I gave a speech on a beginner’s guide to Washington and what I was observing, and they interpreted what I had said in even more hostile ways than I meant it.  So I was, in fact, misinterpreted, although not totally.  There was a grain of truth in it, but I was, in fact, misinterpreted.  I don’t remember the details, but everybody was really angry.  I ran into one of the women who had done this that very afternoon, and I just said, “You know, I got you invited to that meeting, and I’m never going to do that again.  I’m never going to do that again.  You know, you want to work with me, this is fine, but let’s just understand that if this is the way you’re going to play, I can play that way too.”  And by the time I got back to my office, everything was peachy keen, peachy keen.\n\nQ:  What about that first day and the prohibitions about what you could and couldn’t say?\n\nNestle:  I was terrified.  I was absolutely terrified.\n\nQ:  Were you also angry?\n\nNestle:  No.  I was way too scared to be angry.  I mean, I had just left California.  I didn’t have a place to live.  I was newly divorced.  My stuff was on a truck.  I couldn’t go back.  I mean, I was in a stage of life where I was in no position—I didn’t think I was in any position—and this was the only job I got.  I didn’t get any of the other jobs I had applied for.  I was turned down for them.  I mean, it took me a long time to learn how to get a job, and getting this one wasn’t so easy either.  I had a couple of turndowns, bad ones that surprised me a lot before I got to NYU.  So that by the time I got to NYU, I knew what I was doing wrong and I could fix it, and, in fact, the question that had lost me a job at Buffalo was exactly the same question that somebody asked in my interview here, but this time I had a better answer for it.\n\nQ:  What was that?\n\nNestle:  “What’s your management style?”  Please.\n\nQ:  Presumably you hadn’t thought too much about that before.\n\nNestle:  I said, “I like working with people and I like to consult.”  They wanted a management theory, and I didn’t know what management theories were.  So I went to a bookstore and I looked at management theories before I came up here and interviewed, and sure enough, I was asked exactly the same question.  So I could say I was of this theory person.  Can’t even remember what they are.\n\nQ:  So the idea that there were certain things that you couldn’t say, at that point it didn’t disturb you intellectually because you had so much else going on that—\n\nNestle:  There was too much else going on.  Okay, we’re going to use euphemisms, we’ll use euphemisms, but I didn’t know where this was going.  I thought that this was so far at the beginning of the process.  He was expecting to publish this thing within three or four months.  It didn’t come out for two years.  Well, so in that sense I won.  Right?  It was rewritten.  It came out solid.  It was consistent with what these other two reports were saying, and nobody every criticized the science, and that’s what I do.  You know, I’m very careful with the science so the science doesn’t get criticized.  You can criticize the interpretation, that’s fair, but you don’t criticize the science.  And I thought the science had to be impeccable or it would never fly, and it was by the time it came out.\n\nQ:  Did you have to say that to him?\n\nNestle:  It didn’t matter what you said to him.  I mean, I never figured how to work with him.  I figured I spent 30 percent of my time in that office trying to manage him, 30 percent trying to manage Suzanne Harris, who was constantly throwing hand grenades into whatever we were doing, and the rest of the 30 percent writing, and eventually I went home and wrote at home, which, you know, I would stay at home for four or five hours every day writing, and then come into the office and deal with the rest of it.\n\nQ:  It’s pretty amazing that you got all of that done.\n\nNestle:  Oh, yeah.\n\nQ:  Did you realize that at the time?\n\nNestle:  Yes, and he was cracking a whip.  “Why can’t you do it faster?”  Faster, faster, faster, faster, always.  Faster, faster, faster.  You know, there were other things going on at the same time.  Michael Jacobsen lived in the same building that I was in, and so I would give all this stuff to Michael Jacobsen and we would sit and talk about how to make this stuff better.  Then at the same time I was writing testimony.  I was writing testimony that my boss would give for Congress, and questions to the congresspeople who would be asking the questions.  So I was doing all this staff work.  I mean, this was great training, great training.\n\nQ:  It’s fabulous training, but a whole lot of stuff to get done.\n\nNestle:  Yeah.  Well, I got it done, because the punishment for not getting it done was greater than the punishment for doing it badly, and even my bad stuff was better than what a lot of people can do. \n\nQ:  What would that punishment have been?\n\nNestle:  Oh, just having to deal with him about it, just really unpleasant conversations and having to deal with him in this really unpleasant way.  Not just me; Peggy Hamburg was in that office and she was a big help, [and now she is] our new FDA commissioner.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tNestle 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewee:  Marion Nestle \t\t\t\t\t\t        Session #2\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t        New York City\n\nDate:  May 26, 2009\n\nQ:  It’s May 26th.  This is Judith Weinraub.  I am with Marion Nestle in her office at New York University, and we are about to start our second interview.\nGood afternoon.\n\nNestle:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  When we talked the other day about your experience on the Surgeon General’s Report, it sounded as though you were so overwhelmingly busy most of the time that the implications of what you were doing didn’t hit you full in the face and politicize you at that time because it was just too much to process all at that time.\n\nNestle:  Yes, I think that’s the case, and I didn’t really begin to get involved in these kinds of things until I was at NYU for a couple of years.  When I was invited by C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon general, to speak at a meeting that he was running in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute about behavioral causes of cancer, and by that he was talking about cigarette smoking and diet, and I was one of the two diet speakers.  The other was Jane Brody.  But I had never heard what I call the anti-cigarette mafia speak before.  I didn’t know them.  This was an international group of people who devoted careers to anti-smoking, and they gave talks that were beautifully illustrated with photographs—they were slides in those days—photographs of cigarette advertising in remote areas of the world, in the remote villages of the Himalayas, the jungles of Africa.  I mean, anyplace that you could think of in really poor areas all over the world, there was cigarette advertising, and I had never noticed it before.  I mean, I’ve traveled and I had been to some of those places, and I wasn’t looking for cigarette advertising.  I didn’t see it.\n\tAnd then there was a speaker, John Pierce, who’s now at the University California, San Diego, who gave a similar talk, but it was about marketing to children, marketing of cigarettes to children, and here it was advertisements to children, it was largely Joe Camel during that period, of the stores that were near schools, sports facilities, everyplace, music, places where kids might be, slide after slide after slide, and at the end of it, I was just stunned by it.  It was such a powerful visual image of really crass commercial marketing of cigarettes to children.  There was no doubt that this stuff was being marketed to children.\nAnd I turned to Jane Brody and said, “You know, we ought to be doing this for Coca-Cola,” and that was it.  That was it.  After that, I started noticing, and so I began to notice.  I started taking pictures.  I started keeping notes, and began writing about these kinds of things, particularly—I think I started with soft drink pouring rights, contracts.  I went to a meeting near Albany of school food service directors, and somebody asked a question after my talk, what did I think of the pouring rights contracts.  “What are pouring rights contracts?”  I’d never heard of it.  And they explained what they were, and I was so visibly shocked at the idea that school districts would have exclusive contracts with one or another soft drink purveyor to sell that soft drink in the school, that people could see that I was an open vessel.  And before I left that meeting, I had a pile of documents that people at the meeting gave me, including copies of contracts with school districts and the prototype contract that was produced by the state education department as a way to raise money for schools.\n\tSo I wrote an article about soft drink pouring rights in schools.  I did another one on marketing to children in Public Health Reports, and there were some others in between, and by the time the late 1990s came around, I had a bunch of articles under my belt about various issues in which commercial interests influenced federal policy or state policy about nutrition one way or the other.\n\nQ:  When did you make that particular connection, the federal policy?\n\nNestle:  Oh, that actually came earlier.  In the early 1990s I started writing articles about the history of dietary guidelines and the history of dietary guidance policy, and I wrote a—oh, I had forgotten about that.  Right when I first came to NYU, someone that I had known at—oh, I was interviewed by Malcolm Gladwell at the Washington Post, because the Department of Agriculture had just withdrawn its Eating Right pyramid.  This was 1991.  They had just withdrawn the pyramid, saying that it hadn’t been tested on low-income women and children.  I was interviewed by Malcolm Gladwell, who was then writing for the Washington Post, and I said something like, “Oh, good grief.  Not again.”  I mean, the history of dietary guidance is replete with such examples of corporate interference, particularly the meat industry, interference with dietary guidelines of one kind or another, and I was quoted in the Washington Post as saying some rude comment about what had just happened.\nAnd that night at about eleven-thirty at night, I got a call from a staff person at the Department of Agriculture saying, “I saw your quotation.  We’re in a very difficult situation.”  This was a nutritionist at the Department of Agriculture.  She said, “We’ve been told that we can’t talk to the press, and we’re not allowed to talk about this at all, but I have documents that can prove that the reasons that the secretary is giving for withdrawing the pyramid are not true, and that, in fact, this is being done because of pressure from the Cattlemen’s Association.  I have documents that will prove it, and I have copies of the before and after, and I have documents that will demonstrate that this was a completely public transparent process for the last twelve years, and it’s gone through all Department of Agriculture clearances, and I have documents to prove it.  Could you get them to the press?”\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nNestle:  And I said, oh, I thought I could probably do that.\nAnd the next day I got a FedExed package, and then I started getting documents sent to me through faxes from public fax machines, hotel rooms and stuff.  I just called Marian Burros and said, “Do you want this stuff?”  Marian wanted it.  Imagine that.\n\nQ:  Maybe this would be a good time just to insert something about the dual nature of the Department of Agriculture, to give it some context.\n\nNestle:  Sure.  Well, I mean, what happened, what Marian did in her articles, she really was like an attack dog on that particular incident, because it was such a perfect example of conflict of interest at the Department of Agriculture, which, on the one hand, is supposed to be advising the public about diet and health, and, on the other hand, is supposed to be promoting American agricultural interests, which means the interests of large cattle producers.  And so it just came right in the middle of that.  And there were a lot of reasons why it happened.  There was brand-new secretary of agriculture, who didn’t know diddlysquat about what was going on, and hadn’t been involved in the process and didn’t realize that it had gone through all these clearance procedures.\nAnd, in fact, it was at the printer.  It was at the printer having its color adjusted.  I mean, it was ready to go, and to have it withdrawn, it was such a crass example of conflict of interest.  So then lots of reporters wrote about it, but Marian in particular just stayed on it, stayed on it, and stayed on it, and finally blew the whistle at the whole thing about a year later.  They redid the research, and she blew the whistle on the research.  She had actually deduced from things that people told her what the replacement of the pyramid was likely to look like, and it was published in the New York Times, and so embarrassed the Department of Agriculture that they had to back off.  Now, this was another example of Mike McGinnis’ skillful work, because he was the one who brokered that deal.\n\nQ:  With whom?\n\nNestle:  He got the Department of Agriculture to agree to release the pyramid.  That was my understanding of how that happened, that the Department of Health and Human Services stepped in and negotiated a way out of it so there was some face-saving, but eventually the pyramid was released. \n\tSo I had all this inside material on it because it had been sent to me, and, you know, I mean, there were amazing things that happened during that whole process.  Newsweek called one day and said, “We understand you have color graphics of the original pyramid.”\n\tAnd I said, “I don’t, actually.  I have black and white Xerox copy.”\n\tAnd then he said, “I understand that you can get color graphics.”\n\tAnd I said, “I don’t really know how I can do that.”\n\tAnd he said, “We understand that you can do it, and we need them.”  So I made a couple phone calls, and talked to people at the PR agency.\n\nQ:  The PR agency that was working on the—\n\nNestle:  That was working on it.  It was Porter Novelli at the time.\nAnd I said to the person that I talked to, “You and I are going to have a very weird conversation, and I just want to warn you that this is coming.”  And I said, “Newsweek wants a copy of the color graphic of the original pyramid.”\nAnd the guy at the other end was just completely shocked.  He said, “We can’t do that.  We can’t give this to Newsweek.”\nI said, “I’m not asking you to give it to Newsweek.  I’m asking you to give it to me.”\nAnd he said, “I’ll have to think about it.”  And so he hung up the phone, and an hour later I got a phone message saying, “The object that you requested will be at the Four Seasons Hotel in Georgetown at the concierge’s desk at noon.”\n\nQ:  Goodness.\n\nNestle:  So I called back Newsweek, and said that’s where it’ll be, and Newsweek published it, and then they sent me the slides.  So I have those slides.  I have them.\n\tSo I had all this fabulous illustrative material, and I used it in an article that I wrote for a now defunct history journal.  So that article was there.  There was a history of dietary guidelines policy, a history of the pyramid, there was the article on marketing to children and on pouring rights, and I just added in a couple of others, and that was Food Politics.\n\nQ:  But meanwhile, what were you teaching here at that time?\n\nNestle:  The department was Home Economics and Nutrition, then it was Food, Nutrition and Hotel Management, then it was—I mean, it kept changing its name and evolving until 1996, when we invented food studies and that whole business came in.  I was chairing the department so I wasn’t teaching much, but I usually taught one class a semester and ran the doctoral program.  So I taught whatever was needed, community nutrition, nutrition and public health, I mean, whatever.\n\nQ:  So did you have a chunk of time that you could afford to devote to this?\n\nNestle:  It was piecemeal.  I had a sabbatical coming up, and the origin of Food Politics was I had a sabbatical and I needed a project for it.  So I thought, “Well, I’ll just put these essays together into a book,” and of course it got completely out of hand and took a couple more years to do.  It came out in 2002.  Actually, it came out in 2002 and 2003 because the manuscript was so long they split it into two books, and one was Safe Food and the other was Food Politics.\n\nQ:  Oh, I see.  Is that how that worked?  I see.\n\nNestle:  That’s how that worked.\n\nQ:  Interesting.  Did you become angrier as you gathered together this material, or was it what you expected to find or what?\n\nNestle:  Well, I knew it was there and I was looking for good examples, and there was no lack of examples of corporate influence on nutrition policy of one kind or another.  I mean, there were plenty of examples.  It was just a question of which ones to choose and which ones to write about, and some of them I wrote about in greater length than others.  But the core of the book is the material that I had already been working on for some number of years.  And I was particularly eager to have the pyramid chapter in there because that chapter had been plagiarized by somebody else and published in somebody else’s book, and I wanted to reclaim it.  So that was one of the reasons.\n\nQ:  It had been stolen?\n\nNestle:  Yes.  A colleague at the University of Maryland had asked me to send her copies of my papers, and she took the pyramid one and reproduced it almost word for word.\n\nQ:  Oh, my god.\n\nNestle:  Pretty amazing, without much attribution.  So I got my revenge.  I was asked to review her book a couple of times and dealt with that, and then I use her plagiarized version as a case study in plagiarism.  So we teach plagiarism from it here.  I wasn’t going to sue or take her to court or anything like that.  It would have done me no good whatsoever, but I wanted to reclaim that article as my own.  So that was part of the reason for putting that in there.  Also, it’s a great story.  The pyramid story is a great one.\n\nQ:  Did this experience change the way you saw your role, the way you saw what you were doing?\n\nNestle:  No.  Food Politics did.\n\nQ:  Yes, that’s what I meant, actually.\n\nNestle:  I had three motivations for writing Food Politics, aside from the business of having a sabbatical and needing a project to fill that, and I thought by that time I needed a book.  I was trained in a field in which books don’t count, only articles count, but at NYU books count, and I could see that it was time for a book.\nBut besides that, I had three goals for writing it.  One was I wanted better lecture invitations.  You have to be careful what you ask for.  Another was I really—I mean, the real reason for doing it was that I wanted to change the conversation.  Every meeting that I went to about childhood obesity in the late nineties talked about parental responsibility, and nobody was talking about food marketing.  I wanted that to change.  I did not ever want to go to another meeting about childhood obesity without people talking about what food companies were doing to market to kids, and, you know, Food Politics achieved that.  It really did.\nAnd then the third reason was I wanted the American Dietetic Association to stop publishing corporate-sponsored fact sheets about nutrition issues.  They’re still doing it.  Can’t win them all.\n\nQ:  Give me an example of that.\n\nNestle:  Monsanto is the sponsor—well, I’ll name the topic and you tell me who the sponsor is.\n\nQ:  I’m sure I couldn’t, but go ahead, unless it’s blueberries, but go ahead.\n\nNestle:  I’m sure you could.  Sugar.\n\nQ:  I guess there’s a sugar association, Florida Sugar Association.\n\nNestle:  There certainly is.\n\nQ:  Yes, I see.\n\nNestle:  Soft drinks.\n\nQ:  PepsiCo.  I don’t know.\n\nNestle:  Yes.  Right.\n\nQ:  I see.\n\nNestle:  So that’s how it works.  And they’re written by the corporation’s public relations people, and they’re vetted by the American Dietetic Association, but not much.  I don’t think they should be doing that, but they still are.  So you can’t win them all.\n\tBut certainly the big win was the conversation changed, and now everybody talks about marketing to children, and it’s a huge, huge, huge issue for food corporations that sell products that are aimed at kids.  So I think Food Politics had a lot to do with that, and I’m pretty proud of that.\n\nQ:  Did it change the kind of student at all that was coming to NYU to this department?\n\nNestle:  Well, it improved interest in our public health nutrition program, but by that time there was food studies.  I understand that my being here is a big draw for students in a way that’s not really fair, because I hardly meet any of the students.  I teach one class a semester, and I don’t usually have more than twenty-five students in them.  So I don’t get to meet very many of the students who come through the department, but I understand it’s a draw.  But you’d have to ask other people about that.\n\nQ:  What kind of courses do you teach actually here?\n\nNestle:  Well, I’m teaching nutrition for food studies this semester.  I try to teach things that cross at least two of three fields in the department, and last semester I taught nutrition and public health.  Next semester I’m teaching food sociology.\n\nQ:  What is food sociology?\n\nNestle:  Well, it’s going to be food as a social movement, is the way I’m going to do it, I think, and have them read contemporary books that are pushing food as a social movement.  There’s lots of books.\n\nQ:  During the period of time that the department was developing, did you have a role in focusing how the department—I mean, you must have.\n\nNestle:  Well, I was chairing.\n\nQ:  That’s what I meant.\n\nNestle:  I chaired the department from 1988 to 2003, and we started food studies in 1996.  The public health came in in 2002, and that’s when everything fell apart and I stepped down as chair.\n\nQ:  But until then, how did you see the subject developing in a way that it was relevant to the public at large?\n\nNestle:  Well, we have courses in food policy that are required for some of the curriculum.  We were teaching food studies.  We were doing all of these things.  There’s not a large population of students who are interested in doing what I do.  It’s a small niche.  The students who come here come here for many different reasons, but a lot of them are interested in food as—certainly the food studies people are interested in food as a social movement.\n\nQ:  In terms of Food Politics, in the book where you discuss the fact that nobody would talk to you on the record, I found that really fascinating.  Is that because they were employed by the government?\n\nNestle:  Or food companies or health organizations that get funding from food companies.\n\nQ:  But why then were they, in fact, willing to talk to you?  Were they distressed about the way things were going?\n\nNestle:  Yes.  People will always talk; they just don’t want to get into trouble.  It’s easy to get people to talk.  That’s not a problem.  You know, Watergate taught us that.  They just don’t want to be identified.  I could understand that.  I couldn’t get anybody to talk to me on the record.  I mean, even when people said they would, they backed off.  The same thing was true of the pet food book, exactly the same thing, Pet Food Politics.\n\nQ:  Explain how that happened.  What kinds of people were you trying to reach?\n\nNestle:  Well, I was trying to talk to people in pet food companies or government agencies or whatever, you know, or the FDA or whatever.  People were perfectly happy to talk to me; they just didn’t want to be quoted.\n\nQ:  Now, here’s a really naïve question, but if people are very distressed about what’s going on where they’re working, how do they face themselves continuing to work where they work?\n\nNestle:  I can’t answer that question.  They need to make a living.  You know, I’m in a very privileged position.  I mean, look at what’s happening in our society.  I have a tenured job with a salary that’s not enormous, but I can live on it.  It’s a comfortable salary.  I have health benefits.  I have an apartment that I pay half-market rates or less for because I rent it from the university.  I have tenure.  I mean, nobody in our society has tenure anymore.  Nobody does.  This is an enormously privileged position.  I try not to abuse it.\n\nQ:  Did you get the feeling that some people were hoping that somebody would come ask them these questions at some point?\n\nNestle:  I didn’t have any trouble getting people to talk to me or suggest other things.  I mean, look at what happened at that meeting in Albany, where by the time I left that meeting I had a briefcase full of documents.  People were delighted to have somebody do something with them.  I mean, I’ve never had any trouble getting people to help me with my work, and for things that I think are really crucially important, other people vet them.  Every chapter in Food Politics was read by at least two other people, critically read, somebody in the field and somebody not in the field, every single chapter, and sometimes more than two because I needed that kind of feedback.  So ultimately because there are people who read the whole thing, there were at least four people who read every chapter.\n\nQ:  How long has it been known that the country was producing more food than it needed?\n\nNestle:  Oh, since the earliest records.  Since the earliest records.  There were 3,200 calories per person per day in 1909.\n\nQ:  You mean accessible calories?\n\nNestle:  Well, available in the food supply, calories from the first year that the Department of Agriculture began keeping records, and it stayed at 3,200 plus or minus 200 all the way through, with very, very little variation until the early 1980s, when it started to go up.  So there has been an increase of 700 calories since the early 1980s.  But prior to that, it was constant forever.  So there’s always been a huge surplus of food here.\n\nQ:  And at what point was the awareness public that the food companies had to do something to sell that available food?\n\nNestle:  Well, they realized it immediately.  I mean, food companies realized it immediately.  There was a really sharp shift in food company marketing practices starting in the early 1980s.  Larger portions is the most obvious manifestation of that.  Lisa Young’s work, my former doctoral student, she went out and measured, actually did a historical study of when large-sized portions began to be introduced into the food supply, and it was right in the early 1980s when the calories starting going up.\n\nQ:  And large portions meant both in the kinds of things that you get in supermarkets and in fast food places?\n\nNestle:  It’s everything.  It’s absolutely everything, but the most obvious example was muffins.  I was in Washington, D.C. when Michael Kinsley wrote an article about the attack of the killer muffins, and they had gone from being little 200-calorie muffins to being 500 or 600 calories.  Well, you eat that, you’re eating three times as many calories.  You know, larger portions have more calories.\nAnd then the other ways in which food companies started marketing was that food started going in in places where it had never been before.  The soft drink pouring rights contracts were an example of that.  You put vending machines, as many vending machines in schools as you possibly can in order to make sure that lots of products get sold from them.  So you make it socially acceptable to eat in all places at all times.  My famous question, when did it become okay to eat in bookstores?  You know, when I came to NYU in 1988, there were very, very clever signs, and I wish I still had them, that were posted all over the library about how you couldn’t eat in the library.  Now there are two cafes in the library.\nSo, you know, what we know from research that’s been done in the last few years is that larger portions, more frequent eating, closer food availability, number of times a day, all of those encourage people to eat more than they ordinarily would.  So people started getting fat, you know, I think largely as a result of changes in food marketing, and these, in turn, were the result of changes in agricultural policy and in the way Wall Street evaluated firms.\nSo farm policy changed in the 1970s from paying farmers not to grow food, to paying farmers to grow as much as they possibly could, and then in the early 1980s, Wall Street shifted from valuing corporations for long-term slow returns on investment, blue chip stocks, to higher immediate returns on investment.  And that, I think, put huge pressure on all corporations to produce faster, and therefore to cut corners in order to keep prices low.  And for food companies it was just devastating, because they were already trying to sell food in an environment in which there were twice as many calories as anybody needed, and now they had to grow every ninety days on top of that.  Pretty tough to do.\n\nQ:  When people started working on the last farm bill, did they try and get you involved to do any lobbying for them?\n\nNestle:  No.  No.  There were lots of other people doing that.\n\nQ:  There certainly were.\n\nNestle:  I mean, I gave one talk on it.  I was kind of amazed.  It was 1,200 pages and had a table of contents that was seventeen pages long.\n\nQ:  You mean the farm bill?\n\nNestle:  The farm bill.  I mean, there was no way anybody could possibly understand it.\n\nQ:  Were you at all surprised at the way things turned out?\n\nNestle:  No.  I was surprised there was any progress at all.  Every single administration that has come in since I’ve been teaching nutrition, which goes back to the mid seventies, has attempted to get rid of farm subsidies, and not a single administration has ever been able to do it, even though they all come in and say, “We’re going to get rid of farm subsidies.”  Clinton couldn’t do it, Bush couldn’t do it, Obama won’t be able to do it either.\n\nQ:  Are any of the students here interested in things like that?\n\nNestle:  Oh yes.\n\nQ:  But they wouldn’t be working specifically through this department, probably?\n\nNestle:  Yes, they would be working.  Oh, sure.  Yes.  There are students in the department who are very interested in these things.  They take our classes in food policy.  They’ll take my food sociology class.\n\nQ:  I think what depressed me was that it seemed so unlikely that anything would happen from the beginning, and I would go occasionally to meetings where, you know, a lot of the people working hard and honestly on this would count up minute steps for what that might happen as opposed to—\n\nNestle:  Well, there were some minute steps that did happen.\n\nQ:  Well, the geographic preference, that was a big deal.\n\nNestle:  And the organic business, that’s progress.\n\nQ:  Well, tell me how you got from Food Politics to your next books.\n\nNestle:  Well, say food was part of—\n\nQ: Part of it.\n\nNestle:  The original manuscript, this is really funny.  I was used to writing articles.  When you write an article, a twenty-five-page double-spaced manuscript is a ten-page paper when it’s published.  So I wrote twenty-five of them.  I thought I had a 250-page paper.  I thought I had a 250-page book, that’s what I thought, and when I turned the manuscript in, my editor had a heart attack.  He said, “Marion, this is a 900-page book.  Not only is it a 900-page book, but it’s got 200 pages of footnotes.  We can’t do this.”\nSo there was a crisis, the famous Christmas Crisis, where they hired an editor, and the idea was that the editor would go through the manuscript and figure out how to cut it by 40 percent.  That was the idea.  They didn’t tell me that, but that was the idea.  And just before Christmas—and this must have been 2000—the editor sent me a seven-page, single-spaced fax, which was his analysis of the book, and, I mean, I read it and sat on the floor and cried because it was so upsetting.  One of the things in it was maybe I should go to a bookstore and get a book on how to turn a doctoral dissertation into a book that somebody might want to read.  I mean, I was just horribly, horribly offended.\nI called my agent, who was at that point at home for Christmas, and she said, “Fax it to me,” which I did, and she called me back and said, “Marion, he’s not being insulting.  He’s really not.  He doesn’t know how to cut your book.”  And I swear to you, I go back and look at that to this day, and I do not know how she got that out of what his letter said.  I really don’t know how she got that.  She said, “You’ve got to call him.  You have to talk to him.”\n\tSo the next day I called him, and the first words out of his mouth, the first words were, “You know, I don’t know how to cut your book.”  He said, “You write really tight.  The material that you have is really good.  I don’t know how to cut it.”  So then we did a conference call with the editor, and that was when it became two books.  So the last ten chapters or so went to Safe Food.\n\nQ:  But that was published first?\n\nNestle:  No.  Food Politics was published first.  So then it went through an editing process, and the editor was actually very good and I learned a lot from him.  And so Food Politics came out in the spring of 2002, and Safe Food, which was then edited and I completely rewrote it, came out in 2003.\n\nQ:  You completely rewrote it to what end?\n\nNestle:  Oh, it was not sufficiently coherent in theme.  It needed to be developed much more thematically, as a much more coherent book.  And it’s interesting, I’m reading it now because I’m preparing a new edition of Safe Food, and I must say it holds up quite well, quite well.  And it’s too bad it didn’t come out a few years later because it’s really timely.  Also it needed a much better title, and they wouldn’t let me call it The Politics of Food Safety, which was what I wanted to call it, because they said it was too close to Food Politics.  So it’s called Safe Food, which wasn’t very exciting, and then the Bacteria, Biotechnology, and Bioterrorism subtitle is way too scary and nobody wants to read it.\n\nQ:  It’s a hard one, yes.\n\nNestle:  Nobody wants to read it.  So the new edition will be called Safe Food: The Politics of Food Safety.  I think it’ll work much better.  I’m going through and correcting errors and doing that kind of thing, and I’ll write a new chapter to update on what’s happened, but really nothing has changed very much.\n\nQ:  Can you talk about the central points of the book?\n\nNestle:  Which?\n\nQ:  Politics of Food Safety.\n\nNestle:  Yes.  Half the book is about bacterial food safety and the other half is about biotechnology, and they’re perfect examples of the discrepancy between what I call science-based and value-based ways of looking at food safety.  Science-based food safety looks at the number of cases, hospitalizations, deaths, costs, that kind of thing.  Value-based food safety looks at many other issues besides safety.  They’re interested in control over the food supply and whether it’s technological, whether it’s foreign or familiar, whether it’s something that you understand or can’t understand, and who controls it.\n\tThey’re called ‘dread and outrage factors’ in the risk communication literature, and bacterial food safety doesn’t elicit much dread and outrage in people.  It just doesn’t.  That’s why there’s no national food safety movement, even though these horrible things have happened.  And it doesn’t because everybody gets food poisoning, most people recover.  It’s only if your kid is caught in one of these really bad things that you really get into the dread and outrage mood on that.  Whereas biotechnology which, you know, has not known ever to have hurt anyone, fills people with dread and outrage because it’s technological, under the control of Monsanto, unfamiliar.  People feel like they have no control over it at all.\nAnd then I argue in the book that safety is used as a surrogate.  Everybody is worried about the safety of genetically modified foods, and maybe they’re not safe, you could never prove them perfectly safe, but they don’t create 76 million cases of food poisoning a year.  But it’s really easy to generate dread and outrage about it because there’s something very scary about the idea and foreign about the idea of putting genes from one organism into another, [and having one company control so much of the food supply].\nSo that’s the major theme that runs through the book, but the stories that I tell in them are about the big food safety problems of the last year, what E. coli is about, why we have these new microorganisms that nobody ever heard of before and how serious they are.  And the biotechnology is really about politics because, you know, you can argue safety until you’re blue in the face, but there really isn’t much to go on.  But one of the reasons why the people who are involved in biotechnology are so upset about the fact that the public doesn’t like it is because “It’s perfectly safe.  What’s the problem?  Why is there a problem?”  They can’t understand why there’s a problem, and it’s because they don’t believe that the dread and outrage factors count.  I think they count.\n\nQ:  Yes, of course they do.\n\nNestle:  I think they count.  So I’ll write an updated chapter that will talk about the spinach, the tomatoes, the pet food, the peanut butter and the pistachios, each of which has its own object lesson about what needs to be done about the food supply, but the book itself laid out what needs to be done and that hasn’t changed.\n\nQ:  And that is?\n\nNestle:  We need a single food safety agency in farm to table, HACCP.  Everybody knows it, that’s what you need to do.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you explain what the HACCP rules are.\n\nNestle:  Well, it’s that awful name for science-based food safety procedures, hazard analysis, and critical control point, where you identify where the hazards are and where contamination can occur.  You take steps to prevent it.  You monitor to make sure those steps are taken and you test to make sure the whole thing is working.  And where you have HACCP, it’s cut down on food safety problems.  I mean, food is never going to be perfectly safe.  Never.  But we could do a lot better job.\n\tFor example, if there were HACCP rules for pistachios and peanut butter, the FDA has just come out with a report that the pistachio people knew they had salmonella in their pistachios.  They tested.  They found it.  They then cooked the pistachios again.  They roasted them again.  That should have killed any salmonella that were there, but they had no procedures for testing them to see whether it worked or not.  So they just assumed it was okay, and they had no procedures in place for keeping roasted pistachios separate from raw pistachios, so they got mixed together.\n\nQ:  That’s astounding.\n\nNestle:  I think it’s normal.  I think it’s normal.  It’s exactly what happened with the peanut butter, almost exactly what happened with the peanut butter.\n\nQ:  Normal, how so?\n\nNestle:  Well, I mean these companies, they are not required to follow science-based food safety procedures.  They are supposedly required to follow good manufacturing practices, but those are basically voluntary.  I mean, really they can do whatever they want.  Nobody is inspecting.  Nobody is holding them accountable.  There is no accountability in the system.  And so you get some unscrupulous or sloppy or cost-conscious manager or somebody who just doesn’t understand how microbiology works, and there’s plenty of examples of that.\nI tell a story in Safe Food about visiting a meat packing plant that had a blatant violation of standard food safety procedures.  I mean, it was so shocking that they cooked this product, it was sterile, and then they put in a cold room uncovered.  Not only in a cold room, but a cold room in which there was cold air blasting from a fan in the ceiling.  So if there were any bacteria in there, they were being spit out all over the top of that product.  And I said to the people, “How come you don’t cover your product?”\n\tAnd they said, “Well, if we do, it doesn’t cool down fast enough and we miss our second critical control point.”\n\tI said, “Aren’t you worried about listeria?”\n\t“No.”\n\t“Why aren’t you worried about listeria?”\n\t“Because we’ve never had any problem.”  Three weeks later, they had a recall.\n\nQ:  In terms of meat safety, the [USDA] inspectors are supposed to turn up on a daily basis, I’ve been told.\n\nNestle:  USDA is there all the time.\n\nQ:  Meaning they have an office in the plant or something?\n\nNestle:  Yes.  There has to be an inspector in the plant at all times, or the way they do it now for these small plants is that one inspector is in charge of several, but that inspector visits that plant every day.  Now, at the meat packing plant that I went to, they said that you could butcher a dog in front of that guy and he would never notice.  So here is the Department of Agriculture meat inspector in that plant, and doesn’t know enough about microbiology to—\n[Interrupted by fire drill]\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  This is a continuation of my second interview with Marion Nestle.\nLet me ask you something.  What do you do every day?\n\nNestle:  This is what I do.\n\nQ:  No, but I mean you’ve got so much in the air, you have so many obligations, you have so much research, so many books that you’re writing.  What do you read every day, for example?\n\nNestle:  Whatever comes in on e-mail on a daily basis, and then I have piles of journals and things like that that I read, but I’m very dependent on what people send me now.\n\nQ:  But what about your own blog and the amount of—\n\nNestle:  Well, I do it every day, but it’s usually based on what people send me or the feeds that I get of one kind of another.  But I work at home in the morning.  So from whatever time I’m up until about noon, I’m at the computer doing whatever.  If I’m in writing mode, I’m writing at least three hours a day, four if I can do it.  And then I’m in the office and I’m talking to reporters.  That’s what I do.\n\nQ:  But how to you prioritize with the many, many responsibilities that you have?  It just seems like even with what you write alone, it’s an enormous amount of work.\n\nNestle:  If you write three or four hours a day every day, it builds up.  I mean, I don’t feel like I’m—well, today was very difficult because this guy who’s filming something about the Park Slope Food Co-op, I had told him I would go out to the co-op and be filmed there, and I didn’t write it in my calendar.  Oh, and this poor woman with this four-thirty appointment who wants to talk about yogurt, I’ve been putting her off and putting her off, and I’ve really got to get to her.  So that’s what I do.  I see students.  I teach.  I talk to reporters.  It’s not bad.  I travel.\nWhen I stepped down as chair, I was given a very cushy deal here with a lot of unscheduled time that I can fill any way I want to.  I’m on a couple of committees.  I teach one class.  That’s all I do.  It’s not much, and I’m very efficient.\n\nQ:  You are very efficient.\n\nNestle:  I have to do this before I do anything else.\n\nQ:  Just one thing, though.  Would the young woman who didn’t have any encouragement to speak of when you were starting out in school recognize the person that you have become today?\n\nNestle:  Oh, probably not.\n\nQ:  Probably not?\n\nNestle:  Probably not.  I mean, I was never one of these people who could plan or who could look ahead or whatever.  I mean, it just kind of happened.  Food Politics was a life-changing experience, it really was, and it certainly changed the lecture invitation thing.  I mean, I say that as a joke, but people want to hear what I have to say.\nWe have to stop.\n\nQ:  I understand. \n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tNestle 2-  PAGE 1\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Marion Nestle \t\t\t\t\t\t\tSession #3\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t      New York City\n\nDate:  June 29, 2009\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  I am with Marion Nestle.  It’s June 29, 2009, and we are about to start another interview. \nOne of the things that we didn’t get to in the detail before was talking about the field of food studies, how you built this department, what influence that might have had on the field in general.  I know we talked a little bit about the beginning, but could you just start from the beginning and try and follow how it’s grown, changed, what you think of it?\n\nNestle:  Let’s start from its home economics origin.  It was a Department of Home Economics and Nutrition until 1990, when everybody felt like we needed to get rid of home economics, because nobody was teaching it anymore, so the department’s name was changed to Nutrition, Food and Hotel Management, to reflect the programs that were then in the department, which included nutrition and dietetics at the undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral level.  Then there was also a food service management program.  It was called food service management, but it was being run at the undergraduate and the master’s level and, in fact, doctoral level as a hotel management program.  So even though it was called food service management, it was really being run as a hotel management—\n\nQ:  That was the context people understood.\n\nNestle:  I don’t know if it was a context people understood, but it was what students wanted Ph.D.’s in.  So some very important people in the hotel industry came to get doctoral degrees, because this was the only way they could do it, even though their degree said “food service management.”  At the undergraduate level, it was called food service management, but we were able to change its name to food and hotel management, to reflect the actual content that was being taught.\nNow, I had my doubts about the quality of the program, and those doubts  were realized when I went to a meeting in Washington that put up people who were attending  in one of those horrible out-of-town Washington, D.C. hotels that would accept government rates.  This one was at some highway near Tyson’s Corner.  It was just an awful place.  I arrived there very late one night because my train was delayed or whatever, I can’t remember what happened.  But I walked into the hotel at midnight and I was greeted by name when I got up to the desk.  I was very shocked by that.  I thought, “Hmm.  How does this guy know what my name is?  Am I the only person who’s left to arrive?’  I thought maybe he’s done that by the process of elimination.  But, no, he said he was a graduate of our program.  And I thought, “We’re training students at NYU to be front-desk clerks at hotels like this on the night shift?”  I thought, “No, no, no, no, no.  We really shouldn’t be doing this.”\n\nQ:  Was he very young?\n\nNestle:  It didn’t matter.  It didn’t matter.  We should be training students to have better jobs than this, or at least in better hotels.  This is a terrible hotel.  It was an inexpensive hotel, but would accept government rates.  So I was not predisposed to be very happy about this program, and also the faculty member who was in charge of it seemed to me to raise a number of problems about academic integrity, and she was not herself trained in hotel management.  We were running a hotel program without a license to do so, which in academic institutions is not a very stable situation.  So I wasn’t very happy about that.\n\tSo what happened then—this was now heading into the mid 1990s—the School of Continuing Education (SCE) at NYU began to be interested in hotel programs, and they decided that they would start a hotel program in continuing education at the master’s level, and here was this undergraduate hotel program sitting over here, and they wanted consolidation of those programs.  We tried for a year, not a very pleasant year, to figure out how we could work together.  Having two schools work together at NYU was really quite difficult.\n\nQ:  I’m sure it is.\n\nNestle:  Because of the tub-on-its-own-bottom situation, and there are all kinds of horrendous problems, and also the students in our department were better than the students in continuing education.  I mean, that was a problem too, although not that much better.  But SCE wanted it.  So we spent a year trying to figure out how to coordinate this, and I would go to these meetings and explain what this program was doing in our department, what we were teaching, and how it was organized, what a coordinated set of programs would look like, and I could tell I was just talking to people who had no idea what I was talking about.  And I’m pretty good at this kind of stuff.  No matter what I said, nobody understood what I was talking about.\n\nQ:  It’s dispiriting.\n\nNestle:  Which was dispiriting.  So at the end of that year, the dean called me in and said, “Look.”  She said, “I cannot have a conversation with the president of this university without him saying he wants something done about the hotel programs.”  She said, “I’m tired of arguing with him about it.  I’m tired of trying to defend it.  He really wants the hotel program in the School of Continuing Education.  How would you feel about transferring the hotel program over there?”\n\tAnd I said, “It depends on what I get.”  Because this program, horrible as it was, generated a million dollars in tuition for the department a year, a million dollars a year in the department, so we would be giving away a million dollars a year of income for the department and, therefore, the school.  And that was a lot to give up.\n\tAnd she, being a very good administrator, came right back to me with, “What do you want?”\n\tAnd to my enormous surprise, out poured a laundry list.  I wanted to develop a food studies program.  I wanted a faculty position.  I didn’t want to lose our faculty position.  I wanted a faculty position for it.  I wanted the kitchen redone in the department, because we had this 1950s home economics kitchen that was dirty and smelled bad and was full of vermin.  I thought if we were going to be teaching this, we needed to have a food service facility that was really top of the line and that met our needs for the continuing education program we were running at the time, for student courses, for being able to produce events out of that kitchen, and so forth.  And I also wanted a laboratory, because we had a faculty member who was a bench scientist and really didn’t have a place to do that.  I thought we could convert the ladies’ room on the tenth floor into a laboratory without too much expense, and that would work out okay for the kind of work that she was doing.\n\tThe dean said she thought she could give me all, if not most, of that, and what she ended up getting for us was the right to start developing a food studies program when we’d get a faculty position that we could recruit for.\n\nQ:  That’s great.\n\nNestle:  We got $350,000 to redo the kitchen and the rest of it, so that was a one-time lump-sum payment for this program that brought in a million dollars a year, with the idea that we would then build food studies into something that would regenerate that income.\n\tI should say—I forgot about this—that a couple of years earlier, or about three years earlier, we had actually hired somebody else to run the undergraduate food and hotel management program, who actually had some experience in the field [Marcia Raftig].  She was a very interesting black woman, not very well academically trained herself, but a lot of practical experience.  She was wonderful with the students.  When this program was transferred over to the School of Continuing Education, she left.  She quit.  She didn’t want to do that and she did not want to stay in the department, so she’s gone off and done other things.\n\nQ:  Were you able to keep her slot?\n\nNestle:  We kept her slot.  We kept her slot, and that’s how we were able to recruit Amy Bentley.  This was where Clark Wolf came into the picture, because he and I went to a book-signing party for some Marian Burros book, that was up in the seventies, and it was a beautiful night and we decided to walk down to the Village.  I didn’t know Clark very well, and in that conversation he said, “You know, I’m really interested in getting involved in the department and helping you with it.  I think you’ve got a lot of possibility there.  But,” he said, “you know, there’s one thing that blocks me from doing that.”\n\tAnd I said, “What’s that?”\n\tAnd he mentioned the name of the faculty member who was responsible for overseeing all of this food and hotel MM stuff, not the black woman who ran the undergraduate program, but the one who had tenure and was in the department.  He was the first person in my what was then almost six or seven, eight years at NYU, who had ever mentioned to me that there might be something less than perfect about her, and she was the one that I was so concerned about, because she was, I thought, trying to undermine everything that I was doing and made secret deals with students and was really very difficult to deal with.  So that was love at first sight.  At last somebody I could talk to about my extraordinary—besides my therapist—about my extraordinary problems with this particular faculty member.  So that just kind of took away all the barriers.  Then I told him what I was interested in doing, that I had been hanging around with this group Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust in Boston.  I’d been going to all these meetings, I knew there was this tremendous interest in food studies, and I had suggested to the dean that we start a food studies program here, although I didn’t have the faintest idea how to go about doing it.\n\tHe said, “I can help you with this.”\n\tI said, “How can you help me?”\n\tAnd he said, “Watch.”\n\nQ:  That’s great.\n\nNestle:  So at that point I thought, okay, this is interesting.\nI happened to go to a meeting of Les Dames d’Escoffier, or I had just been inducted into Les Dames d’Escoffier, and I asked the ladies who were sitting around the table what they thought of Clark Wolf, and they said, “Oh, my god, don’t touch him with a hundred-foot pole.”\n\tAnd I said, “Why not?”\n\tAnd they said, “Oh, you can’t trust him.  You don’t do anything.  You can’t do anything with him.”\n\tI said, “Could you tell me a little bit more?”\n\nQ:  What you mean.\n\nNestle:  “What you mean and what the problem is?”\n\tAnd they said, “Well, first of all, he’s going to want credit for everything.”\n\nQ:  Fine.\n\nNestle:  “And secondly, there are going to be big problems with money.”  And I thought, “I’m not paying him.  He’s doing this on a pro bono basis.  We’re not going to have any problems about money because there’s no money involved.  And I don’t care if he gets all the credit.  This is fine.  He can have all the credit he wants.”\n\tAnd so he put together this advisory committee, and the advisory committee met once and looked at the food service program that we were doing at the master’s level and said, “Great program.  You’re teaching them a lot of great things.  You’re not teaching them nearly enough about food.”\nSo I was able to take that report and go down to the dean and say, “Here.”  Now, I’m not sure exactly the sequence of events here.  That may have occurred before the hotel program went away, but whatever it was, these things were all happening at the same time.\n\nQ:  Within a small time frame.\n\nNestle:  It was in the summer of 1995 all of these things were happening.  So the result of it was, the dean said, “Okay, go ahead.  Create these food studies programs.  We can do that.”  The department agreed to it, and it went through the university and state procedures.\nThen in June or July of 1996, Marian Burros wrote about it.  Clark told Marian that the state had approved it, and she called and said, “I’ll write about it,” and did.  The day that it came out in the Food section of the Times, we had students in our offices that afternoon, holding copies of her article and saying, “I’ve waited all my life for this program.”\n\nQ:  That’s thrilling.\n\nNestle:  So we had a class in the fall.  We had fifteen students in the fall, just like that.  Blessings to the New York Times.  So that was it.  By that time, we had recruited Amy Bentley.  We spent that year recruiting.\n\nQ:  What was Amy supposed to be teaching?\n\nNestle:  Amy was, at that time, an instructor, a non-tenure-track instructor at University of Colorado.  We put out ads saying we were looking for somebody to run our food studies programs, and she was a historian who had written a book about food in the Second World War, and applied.  So did several other people.  We actually had some very interesting candidates for it.  But she had had so much university teaching experience and so much experience with students and with the way universities work, and she was, herself, and is, a very elegant person, that I thought she could walk in and do it from day one.  I mean, she was a really superb hire, as far as I’m concerned.\n\nQ:  What was food studies?  How was that defined at that moment?\n\nNestle:  Well, it didn’t have a definition.  There was one university, Boston University, that had started a gastronomy program a few years earlier, something that Julia Child had wanted, that she organized with Jacques Pépin.  They got that started in the Continuing Education School at B.U., and it was a master’s of arts program, but it was in Continuing Education, and they called it gastronomy, which I thought was a very bad mistake.  Universities don’t do gastronomy; universities do studies. And here at NYU we have African studies, film studies, women’s studies, environmental studies.  Everything is studies.  So I thought food studies.  It works.  There was a little problem in the department about it.  They wanted to call it food science, but we don’t do food science here.\nThis was to be a program that would look at food from a cultural perspective, and it started out with two tracks, one in food management and one in culture and food.  So we would take the existing—part of it was to make it look as if it was building on existing material, which in some sense it did.  So it built on the existing food service management program, and then created food studies at the undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral level.  We had doctoral applicants as well.  So everything happened.  You have an article in the New York Times, everybody knew about it, and it was the zeitgeist.  It was the time.  Everybody was interested in food, and people signed up immediately and they all had really good reasons for doing it.\nSo here we were.  Then we started out with that, and after a few years, I mean, we already had Jennifer Berg, who was here.  She was working on her doctorate and running the student side of the program.  This thing was all pieced together with smoke and mirrors.\n\nQ:  What was Jennifer’s doctorate on?\n\nNestle:  She did a food studies doctorate.  She signed up in the doctoral program, so she was working here and she’d been teaching as an adjunct in the department for a long time.  She’s wonderful with students.  She worked on her doctorate, which I thought was very sensible.\n\tThe number of students expanded, and then over the years we were able to recruit Krishnendu Ray, who was another first-rate appointment, and then Gabriella Petrick.  So there are now four Ph.D. faculty members in the food studies program.  We’ve graduated four doctoral students, and there are nine others in the pipeline.  We told our doctoral applicants that there was no chance they would ever get academic positions, because food studies didn’t exist as a field anywhere else, but they all have academic positions, except for Mitchell Davis, who just got his degree and is with the James Beard Foundation.\n\nQ:  You didn’t think that they could get positions because there weren’t enough positions?\n\nNestle:  There weren’t food studies programs, and academia is very field-specific.  So if you’re not trained in history, you don’t get a job in the history department.  But they’re all teaching in one way or another, except for Mitchell, who’s vice president of the Beard Foundation.  We think they’ll get jobs, and also because food studies programs are now opening up everywhere.  There are five or six in the States now.  There’s one in Australia.  There’s one in Italy.  I mean, they’re all over the place.  Two universities in New York have just added programs, so those are programs that are starting this fall.  Yes, they’re competition, but they’re also places where our doctoral students can get teaching jobs.  So we’re for it.\n\nQ:  Do the different places functioning now have different focuses?\n\nNestle:  Oh yeah.  I mean, there’s one that’s out of an anthropology department and one that’s out of something else.  I mean, everybody makes do with the resources that they have available.\nI think the other point about this is that one of the things we started very early on was a colloquium.  You’ve attended.  That colloquium that you’ve been attending, it’s been going on for ten or twelve years now, and that was started because doctoral students from anthropology, history, American studies, Jewish studies, all over the university were coming to us and saying, “We don’t have anybody in our department to talk to about our doctoral dissertation.  We want to do doctoral dissertations on food, and there’s nobody there who knows anything about it.  Can we come and talk to you?”  So we started this colloquium, which was originally to be doctoral-trained faculty and doctoral students.  And now everybody can do food doctoral degrees.  Everybody can.  I mean, this is an enormous change in ten years, and I think we started it.  I don’t think B.U. started it, because they were in Continuing Education.\n\nQ:  It was a different focus.\n\nNestle:  It was a different focus and more on cooking.  But I think we did, we made it respectable, we gave it academic respectability.  Our students publish like mad, which is what counts.  Our faculty are doing really well.  Amy got tenure.  Krishnendu and Gabriella will be up pretty soon; they’ll get tenure too, I would imagine.  Everybody is doing what they’re supposed to be doing.  The students love the program.  Not everybody, but a lot of them really love it.  They go off and do really interesting things.\n\nQ:  Are there any subjects that they must take?\n\nNestle:  Oh yeah.  There’s a curriculum.\n\nQ:  What are the—\n\nNestle:  You can get a copy of the handout for the program and you’ll put that in the record.\n\nQ:  Okay.\n\nNestle:  I don’t need to do that, and it’s changed and I don’t have anything to do with it anymore.  So I teach an occasional class, as I am in the fall.  I’m teaching food sociology in the fall.\n\nQ:  Where did you get the money for the additional faculty?\n\nNestle:  Well, as the student population increased, we have a tuition-driven resource allocation system, so as the numbers of students in the program increased—\n\nQ:  Somebody’s keeping track.\n\nNestle:  Oh, believe me, they keep track to the penny.  You can’t run a program with 150 students with one faculty member; that’s impossible.  So you have to have more faculty, and as the program expands, you can argue for more.\n\nQ:  Were you responsible for finding the faculty members?\n\nNestle:  Just Amy.  I stepped down as chair after that, fairly soon after that.\n\nQ:  To focus on your own work?\n\nNestle:  I had been chair for fifteen years.  There was a big change of administration.\n\nQ:  That’s a long time.\n\nNestle:  The faculty was very tired of my administrative style, for good reason, I think, and it was time for me to do something else.  Fifteen years is a very long time for department chairs in academic institutions.\n\nQ:  Have you been following the ASFS thread recently?\n\nNestle:  No, I don’t follow threads.\n\nQ:  Well, I don’t follow very many of them, but there is one that’s basically asking—people perceived it as where are there food studies programs, but what this woman was really asking was where are there anthropology departments where people are—\n\nNestle:  There’s been one at Penn for a long time.\n\nQ:  But it’s just amazing, because every day people pop up with something else.  I don’t know.  Why do you think it’s grown so much?  There are obviously many reasons.\n\nNestle:  People are interested in food.  It’s the zeitgeist.  It’s Michael Pollan.  I think Michael Pollan has a great deal to do with it.  He has two books on the bestseller list, one which has been on the bestseller list for more than ninety weeks.  I can’t tell you how many students I’ve seen who’ve read his books and say, “I want to do this.”  I hear it all the time.  So he has opened up this kind of approach to food to an audience that was never possible before, a bestselling mass audience of millions of people.  I don’t know how many books he’s sold, but it must be millions.\n\nQ:  Extraordinary.\n\nNestle:  Yes.  And they’re coming into it for the right reason, and this is the right place to come, because last year we started this food systems.  We dropped the food management, finally, and picked up food systems, which makes perfect sense.  So we’re now looking at it at the urban agriculture side and on the food and culture side, and students specialize in one or another.\n\nQ:  And the food systems is the urban agriculture?\n\nNestle:  Yes, mainly.  This makes sense to do urban agriculture here.  And it’s very interesting to me that in Marian Burros’ initial article about the program, she interviewed Alice Waters, and Alice Waters said, “They’re not teaching about agriculture.”  And I thought, “Amazing.  Look at where we are.  What are we going to do, grow farms in Washington Square?”  Well, what do you know.  We’re growing farms at NYU now.  What do you know.\n\nQ:  It’s amazing.  It really is.\n\nNestle:  It’s amazing.  Alice was way ahead of her time.  And there it was in that article.  An amazing document, that article.  Amazing.  Thank you, Marian.  It was lovely of her to do that.\n\nQ:  And thank you, Alice, who is certainly strong-minded.\n\nNestle:  Right.  Yes.\n\nQ:  When you point out to her that certain things that she suggests might be a little hard to actualize, was she being perhaps unrealistic?  She basically says somebody has to be stalwart.\n\nNestle:  Well, she’s absolutely right.  I mean, here we were so proud of getting this thing through, and she said, “You’re not doing enough.  You’re really not getting it.”  And it was the point.  Took me a long time to catch on to this point, but her point was that we really weren’t getting it, that you can’t teach about food and culture if you don’t understand agriculture.  And here we are with a gardener at NYU who is trying to use NYU open space to plant vegetables.  Bless him.\n\nQ:  How did that happen?\n\nNestle:  I don’t know.  He got in touch—I mean, I only just found out about it, but he got in touch with me a couple of months ago and asked if I would help, calling a meeting this summer of everybody who’s working on these urban agriculture projects at NYU and throughout the city.  I mean, most people are away in July, but we’re going to have a meeting at the end of the month, to try to give him some help and focus in what he’s doing, and getting through the university bureaucracy so that he can use some of the land that’s available.  I mean, there’s some very funny things about it.  The biggest piece of open green space at NYU is around Silver Towers, the faculty housing.  It’s an I.M. Pei building that has just been landmarked.\n\nQ:  I didn’t realize it had been landmarked.\n\nNestle:  It’s just been landmarked.  So to do gardens there is impossible, and he’s been told that you’re going to need permission from the Pei firm.  I mean, it’s just ridiculous.  Right now it looks like a deserted minefield.\n\nQ:  Can you work with the city programs, the urban spaces that are—\n\nNestle:  I mean, he’s trying to.  Under his purview he’s got eighty-four planter boxes, and if you’ve seen the planter boxes along Green Street, there are vegetables in them.  They’re quite pretty.\n\nQ:  And how might that be related to the food studies program?\n\nNestle:  Well, I think our students could get involved in some of these things, in looking at the way urban agriculture can be done.  Everybody is growing food these days.  This is the year.  The seed companies say they can’t keep seeds in stock.\n\nQ:  That’s amazing.\n\nNestle:  And I look at it, this program started in 1996 and here we are, thirteen years later, and it’s a completely transformed issue in academia, where everybody is writing about food.  Marvin Taylor says the English department is the biggest user of the materials there.  That’s a big change from thirteen years ago.\n\nQ:  That’s huge.\n\nNestle:  The anthropology department, everybody thinks these food dissertations were fabulous.  They were fabulous, actually.  Everybody’s doing it.\n\nQ:  How much did you know about agriculture, the agricultural system, before this happened?\n\nNestle:  Oh, not much.  Not much.  I’m a great devotée of Joan Gussow.\n\nQ:  Yes.  Fabulous.\n\nNestle:  And so I had heard Joan speak, and I had the same view about Joan for a long time that I did about Alice Waters, that they were right, but really this was impossible.  Well, it was not impossible, and they were absolutely right.  I first heard Joan speak about these kinds of problems that are completely normal now, that everybody knows about these kinds of agricultural problems.  I heard her speak about them in 1980 for the first time.\n\nQ:  She lived the life.\n\nNestle:  She lives the life, but beyond that, she’s such a clear thinker about how nutrition is related to agricultural production.  And I didn’t get it for a really long time, but I did eventually.  I get it now.\n\nQ:  And do the students get it now?\n\nNestle:  Oh yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  They’ve read Michael Pollan.\n\nQ:  You have to read more than that.\n\nNestle:  Yes.  They’ve read Michael Pollan.  They get it.\n\nQ:  Could you compare the interest that there was among your students in the farm bill this go-round, to any last farm bill?\n\nNestle:  I don’t think there was anybody who knew about the farm bill the last time.\n\nQ:  Yes, that would be my suspicion.\n\nNestle:  There were a lot of people who were looking at those kinds of issues.  They’re in the food studies program.  The students who are interested in those kinds of things are largely in food studies.  They’re not so much in public health.  There’s a public health nutrition program, but it’s still very focused on dietetics.  So the nutrition people haven’t quite gotten this.  There are a few students who have, but not many.\n\nQ:  How do you see food studies developing and growing?  Agriculture is a very specialized subject.  It’s a large subject, but if it doesn’t fall within the—\n\nNestle:  Oh no.  Oh no.  Agriculture is tied into everything.  It’s tied into climate change.  It’s tied into poverty.  It’s tied into—I mean, anything that you can think of.  It’s absolutely integrated.\n\nQ:  So those departments could—\n\nNestle:  What departments?\n\nQ:  Departments that dealt with the environment or had courses in—\n\nNestle:  They all are.  They all are.  I mean, I can’t believe this invitation list to this meeting that the gardener is calling, or that I’m calling for the gardener.  I can’t believe the departments that are represented, the programs that are represented.  I didn’t even know they existed.\n\nQ:  Tell me what some of them are.\n\nNestle:  Well, turns out NYU Medical School has a glass garden.  What’s that?  I have no idea.  There’s all these environmental things that I didn’t know anything about.  There’s a whole bunch of student groups.  There are green groups that are trying to green-up the campus.  There’s nutrition, food studies and public health.\n\nQ:  That’s very exciting.\n\nNestle:  It’s very exciting.  And could the gardens be a place where all of these people could come together?  I think so.  I think so.  NYU could be a leader in using urban agriculture to further its mission in teaching, research, and public education, public service, which is what the university is about.  Greening-up the campus will be lovely for community relations.  The community hates NYU.\n\nQ:  I probably shouldn’t put this on this, but I’m going to.  I have thought for some time that—I mean, the world is such a horrible frightening and challenging place in terms of things you cannot do anything about, whether it’s the wars or—\n\nNestle:  Yeah, you can do something about food.\n\nQ:  That’s what I mean.  I have—\n\nNestle:  You can do something about food.  Every time you go to a store and buy food, every time you make a choice about what you’re eating, you’re voting with your fork.  And everybody gets it.  The other thing is, these issues are so accessible through food in a way that they’re not accessible any other way.  You can talk to people about the most complicated worldwide issues and do it through food and they get it.  They absolutely get it.  So then there’s no end of resources.  That pile of books over there are the books that I went through to pick out the books I’m going to use this fall in my food sociology class.  It was really difficult to choose among them for this.  I tried to keep them all within the last year or two and pick ones that I thought were really, really good.  I hope the students like them.\n\nQ:  The kinds of questions that you get on your blog, do they reflect a wider interest and knowledge of?\n\nNestle:  Oh yeah.  I mean, I don’t know how many people read my blog.  I don’t think it’s all that many.  But I mean, there’s just a huge interest in it.  It’s probably a huge interest in 10 percent of the population, but it’s—\n\nQ:  That’s a lot.\n\nNestle:  But it’s young.  It’s young people.  They get it.  They get green, they get environment, and they get that the way you grow food and the way you deal with food has a lot to do with public health and with the environment.  So these things are all integrated and there’ll be lots and lots of these courses taking place in lots of different places.  It would be nice if they were coordinated, but that doesn’t always happen.\n\nQ:  What do you think the future of this department is?\n\nNestle:  I have no idea.  I really have no idea.  I’m not the future of this department.\n\nQ:  I realize.\n\nNestle:  I’m not the future of this department.  I really have no idea. \n\nQ:  But do you have a sense of what kind of students are—\n\nNestle:  All I know is they get better and better.\n\nQ:  You can’t do better than that.\n\nNestle:  You can’t argue with that.  I don’t know.  I mean, I’m really not involved in the management of the programs anymore.\n\nQ:  But you observe who comes through, in terms of students.\n\nNestle:  Yeah.  I get to know the students who are in my class, so I get to know twenty-five students a semester.\n\nQ:  But the colloquium is interesting, too, because it seems to bring in a faculty and even not faculty, doctoral students from other universities.  So that seems to be a spread.\n\nNestle:  Yeah.  It’s doctoral students, doctorally trained faculty members from universities all over the New York area, and food writers, sort of high-level food writers.  It’s not open; it’s invitation only.  There’s a quite large mailing list, but usually about twenty people come.  And it’s been going on for a very long time, which is, in itself, amazing.  We had a grant.  We applied for a Humanities Council grand.  I mean, that raises the whole business about the fact that this is in the Steinhardt School, which is one of the—there’s a class system of schools at NYU, and this is not one of the upper-class schools, so in order to get that grant, we had to have somebody from Arts and Sciences be the P.I. on it, and that was Susan Rogers, who’s in anthropology.  Then Barbara Kirschenblatt-Gimblett also, who had been teaching a food and culture course for a very long time.  So the three of us had done those original grants, and then when the Humanities Council changed the way they did the grants, the group decided they didn’t want to do it.  They wanted to keep going exactly as it was, and now I think they’re going to try to ratchet it up a notch again.  I think it’s about time to do something a little bit different.\n\nQ:  What about the Food Politics book, the other part of that book [Safe Food], and What to Eat.  Don’t you think that’s had an impact?\n\nNestle:  I’d like to think I had an impact on Michael Pollan.\n\nQ:  Aha.\n\nNestle:  Without any question he certainly incorporated a lot of my ideas, not in Omnivore’s Dilemma as much as in In Defense of Food.  So in that sense, my ideas, Joan Gussow’s ideas, were given a much, much wider voice than either she or I could do.  I consider him to be the best student I ever had.  So, yes, they were influential.  I’ve taught in his program a few years ago.\n\nQ:  At Berkeley.\n\nNestle:  At Berkeley.  I was teaching in his program.  I did that for two years.  He’s heard me speak numerous times and takes those ideas, mixes them with others, and then puts them together in this elegant way.\n\nQ:  Yes, he does, and he’s a—\n\nNestle:  Extraordinary writer.\n\nQ:  —good speaker.\n\nNestle:  And communicator.  Fabulous speaker.  And he’s opened up this whole—I think, for this generation of students.  I was interviewed by something or other, and somebody said, “Do you think he’s influential?”  [laughter]  That was my reaction.  That was my reaction.  This was just after—it was the week in which Washington State University had bought 2,000 copies of his book for entering students.  I can’t remember what the number was; 5,000, I think.  Five thousand copies of his book for entering students, and then obviously because members of the agricultural board of trustees complained, they decided not to give them out.  This was going to be the book that all freshmen read.\n\nQ:  They complained because?\n\nNestle:  Well, it was anti-industrial agricultural, and Washington State’s right in the middle of—it’s in eastern Washington, and it’s right where the big agricultural places are in Washington State.  They denied that, but there’s no other reason why—they’d already bought the books.  So there could be no other explanation for it.  A lawyer in Seattle, who represents clients who had been victims of food poisoning cases, that’s how he’s made his living, Bill Marler, of Marler and Clark, Washington State heard that they couldn’t afford to bring Michael Pollan to the campus because of the budget cuts, and he said, “I’ll pay for it,” and offered to cover the $40,000 that they were missing.  So there was this enormous brouhaha about it, and the net result was they gave the books out to the students.  They were extremely embarrassed.  They denied it had anything to do with pressure and so forth and so on.\nAll of that happened at exactly the same week that I was asked this question, and I said, “There are going to be 5,000 undergraduates at Washington State, many of whom come from agricultural families, who are going to be reading Michael Pollan’s book and are going to know that the university tried to suppress it.”\n\nQ:  Not good.  In terms of the books that you’re thinking about using for—\n\nNestle:  My class? Here’s the pile.\n\nQ:  Of course.  These books might not have been written at another time period.\n\nNestle:  Oh, not in the profusion that are coming out now.  I can’t keep up with them.\n\nQ:  This is Mark Winne’s, Closing the Food Gap.  I don’t know what Farm City is.\n\nNestle:  It’s a brand-new book.  It’s one of Michael Pollan’s students who has written a book about urban farming in Oakland, California.  It’s gotten fabulous reviews.  They have to read at least one of my books, so they’re reading Pet Food Politics.  Bottlemania is a book by a woman who’s written terrific polemic about the need to protect public water supplies.  Stuffed is a book about how obesity isn’t all the problem it’s cracked up to be.\n\nQ:  Really?\n\nNestle:  Well, I believe in a little controversy.  Everybody can’t say the same thing.  The World is Fat is Barry Popkin’s discussion of international obesity issues.  Let them Eat Junk is a really interesting analysis in which this author, who I don’t know, but I have a blurb on the back, talks about how capitalism, how our current capitalism, the system of capitalism creates hunger and obesity.  So these are, I think, interesting books.\n\nQ:  Interesting to talk about.  And Appetite for Profit?\n\nNestle:  That actually came out a few years ago, but I really like it.  It’s a book on how to fight the food industry by a lawyer in San Francisco, and it’s about marketing to kids.  Also a very clear thinker.  And the one book I’m sorry about and I can’t use is Janet Poppendieck’s new book about school food, because it won’t be out in time.  They can’t promise.  I called the publisher and they cannot promise me they can have twenty-five copies by the time the semester is under way, even though it’s coming out in January.  So, next class.  Three, four, five, six.  There’s one more.  I’m missing one.  I don’t know what it is.\n\nQ:  Do you have any idea how many students will be in the class?\n\nNestle:  Ah, this one.  I’m using this.  Food, Inc.  And I’m going to have them see that movie and another movie.  But this is very good.  It’s got a bunch of essays in it, including one from me.  It has one from Eric Schlosser, Michael Pollan.  It’s got the whole works in it.  So they’re very current.  Except for Appetite for Profit, they’re all out in the last year or two.  They’re all worth reading.\n\nQ:  Has everybody King Corn by now so you don’t have to—\n\nNestle:  I’m going to talk to them about movies, and I have copies of all of these.  We can arrange for showings.  I can’t show them in class because the classes aren’t long enough, but we can find a time to do—if they haven’t seen them.  I think everybody should see King Corn.\n\nQ:  Oh, it’s wonderful.\n\nNestle:  It’s wonderful.  And the King Corn guys are making a movie called Truck Farm.  Do you know about that?\n\nQ:  No.  What is that?\n\nNestle:  Oh, Truck Farm.  They are growing a farm on the back of a pickup truck in Brooklyn.\n\nQ:  The two of them or the three of them?\n\nNestle:  Actually, two of the three are living in Brooklyn and they have a pickup truck that they are growing vegetables in the back of, and they’re selling it as a CSA.  So for $20 I bought a share.\n\nQ:  Where in Brooklyn? [Red Hook]\n\nNestle:  I don’t know.\n\nQ:  They’ll deliver or something?\n\nNestle:  Yes, they brought the truck out and parked it in front of my building and cut off my lettuce and delivered my lettuce and my herbs, and they said the tomatoes are coming.  Pretty funny.  It’s going to be a wonderful movie.  They have a sense of humor.\n\nQ:  They do.  It’s just a different world that you probably couldn’t have imagined when you started all this.\n\nNestle:  Absolutely not.  I mean, did it ever occur to me that I was going to get one e-mail message a week asking me to be in a food movie?  I had no idea.  Michael Pollan does them; I don’t do them.  I don’t do very many of them.  No, that seems amazing.  I cannot believe the number of books I’m asked to blurb.  I can’t believe the number of books that are coming out about these same issues over and over and over.  Look, I’ve got twice as many over there that were hard choices.\n\nQ:  And your speaking schedule must be daunting.\n\nNestle:  Oh no.  I’ve cut way back.\n\nQ:  But the invitations must be—\n\nNestle:  Yeah, they’ve slowed down a little bit and my price has gone up, so that’s helped it a little bit, but, yeah, there’s no end to it.  I mean, there seems to be absolutely no end.  It’s been like this since Food Politics came out.  One of the reasons I wrote Food Politics was I wanted better speaking invitations, and I’ve got to put that down, you’ve got to be careful what you ask for.\n\nQ:  Is there anything else we haven’t talked about that you would want to talk about with regard to this?\n\nNestle:  I think that’s the critical one.  Did we talk about the beginning of the library?  I can’t remember.  How the library came about, the food studies collection.\n\nQ:  Not precisely, no.\n\nNestle:  The two things at NYU that I’m most proud of are the food studies program and the food studies collection in the library, in addition to what’s happened to the department in general.  It’s really a lot better than it was when I came.  We didn’t talk about that, the business about being offered a bound set of Gourmet?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nNestle:  Well, let’s tell the story.  This is another before-and-after.  In the early 1990s, there was a man who was a restaurant reviewer—no, who was a copy editor for Nation’s Restaurant News, and he ended up with thirty or forty books a year, and he wanted to give them to the library in honor of his mother, who had gone to NYU, a very beautiful woman, and he was very fond of her.  I spent three years negotiating with the library to try to get them to take these forty cookbooks.  They really didn’t want them, and they eventually took them, but they required him to give them money for the cataloging.  They were really quite uninterested.\n\tSometime in that period, somebody got in touch with me and said they had a complete bound set of Gourmet and would the library want it, and they said, “Oh no, we don’t have room for that.”\n\tSo then a few years later, I got an e-mail from an historian friend of mine [Ruth Rosen] who was then at UC-Davis, and she was on a listserv for a bunch of historians, and one of them was a guy in New York who I actually knew, who said his aunt had been a food writer for Associated Press, and she was in her nineties and they needed money for her full-time care, and she had a lot of cookbooks and they were looking for a home for her collection.  He wasn’t sure how many there were; he thought maybe 8,000.\n\nQ:  That’s a lot.\n\nNestle:  That’s a lot.  And so she forwarded it to me.  So I forwarded it to somebody at the library, and the people at the library who deal with our department change all the time and I can never remember who they are.  This time the librarian came back and said, “Oh, you ought to talk to Marvin Taylor about that.  He’s interested in food.”  So I forwarded the message to Marvin Taylor, and his immediate reaction was, “Oh, my god, go look at it.”  It was on Jane Street, and I went over.\n\nQ:  That’s very convenient.  [laughs]\n\nNestle:  It was extremely convenient.  And I knew the guy.  So I wandered over there one day and looked at it, and I was stunned, just absolutely stunned, because what she had done was to take every book that she got at the Associated Press between 1940 and 1980 and organized them.  So she had an enormous bookcase full of children’s cookbooks.  She had one on wine; she had one on African American cooking.  I didn’t know there were that many books on African American cooking.  She had shelves and shelves and shelves of books on cheeses.  Anything you could think of, books on food in New York, books on food in Italy, books on food in—anything you could think of.  The books covered the whole top floor of this brownstone.  Every available wall space was filled with books.  Bookshelves lined the stairs going down.  They were spilling out all over the place.  There were books everywhere.\n\tThen she had file cabinets, and the file cabinets were filled with letters from James Beard, from the Rombauers, from all of these people that she had corresponded with.  She was James Beard’s buddy, talked to him every morning on the phone.\n\tI came back and called Marvin and said, “Marvin, you’ve got to go look at this.  You’ve got to go look at this.  We have to have this.”  And we got it.  We got it.\nSo it turned out to be 12,000 cookbooks and about 6,000 pamphlets and a lot of really quite wonderful letters and all those kinds of things, because Marvin, who was the new curator of the Fales, had decided that he really needed—he had done the Downtown Collection, and he was looking for another area of special collection, and this seemed really appropriate because the food studies program had started and the excuse was now that they needed materials to support food studies, which of course they did.  So we now have 20,000 books and this fabulous brochure, and the collections are pouring in, absolutely pouring in.  I mean, it’s wonderful, and it was all because of bound sets of Gourmet.\n\nQ:  That’s amazing.  Is it difficult to raise money to catalog them?\n\nNestle:  It’s easier than it used to be.  I mean, this is one of these things that’s snowballing.  I mean, I have this thing that I do, where if I’m giving a talk for a food industry group, I can’t take the honorarium because of conflict of interest, but I’m not willing to do it for free, so I ask them to donate to the library, and they’re amazingly happy to do it.\n\nQ:  That’s brilliant.\n\nNestle:  So there will be $3000 for a talk I gave last week.  It’ll come in eventually.  They come in, and I think over the years it’s been 40,000, 50,000 dollars, I think.  So you can do a lot of cataloguing for that.  And other people are doing it too, like Les Dames d’Escoffier is raising money for the library.  That’s wonderful.  And I think as people find out about it, as they realize what’s so wonderful about the collection, the fact that it’s open to anybody who wants to do research is extraordinary.  You don’t have to be an NYU faculty member or student to use it, means that—I look at it as lasting legacy.\nMarvin’s wonderful to work with over it.  He’s just done this amazing thing, where the sister of somebody that used to work for Clark runs a food bookstore in San Francisco [Omnivore Books].  Clark and Marvin and I were all out there last year, and I told Marvin he had to go look at this book and he had to meet this woman, and he didn’t.  He just couldn’t arrange it, couldn’t fit it in.  But she [Celia Sack] came to New York a few weeks ago and they fell in love, as I knew they would.  I knew they would, because she’s amazing.  So he asked her to send him a list of what she had, and he’s buying everything that she can bring in that’s related to the focus of our collection.  So she’s now collecting for the library.  I couldn’t be happier.\n\nQ:  That’s thrilling.\n\nNestle:  And she’s going to antique book shows.  She’s very, very good at what she does, and she really knows the field.  She’s a lovely person, just lovely.  I knew they would like each other.  And her store is charming, Omnivore Books in San Francisco.  It’s really a lovely place, right next to a pet food store, which is how I got to meet her.  That’s how I met her; she owns a pet food store.  She and her partner own a pet food store.\n\tSo all these things.  Every single one of those events at the Fales brings in more collection.  Every collection brings in more collection.  Everybody who hears about it says, “I know somebody who’s in their seventies and they’re downsizing and they don’t know what to do with their stuff.”  And that’s just what you want, is people who cannot bear to give up the collections that they spent all their lives doing, but the idea that it would go into a library and be preserved the way this library preserves those collections makes you think, “Okay, this is where my stuff is going to go.”\n\nQ:  Which is fabulous.\n\nNestle:  I do that in two places in the library.  I do my food stuff to the Fales and then my family and political things go to the Tamiment in the library, where I organized a summer camp collection.\n\nQ:  How wonderful.\n\nNestle:  There was a wonderful event about that, and we probably should put on record that there’s a tape of that event at the Tamiment.  It took place this spring, and I chaired it.\n\nQ:  Was it called—\n\nNestle:  It was the Higley Hill reunion, Higley Hill summer camps, and about fifty people came who had gone to those camps.  The guy at the Tamiment and I did it.  It was really wonderful.  He said it was one of the best events they’ve ever run.  So there’s a tape of that in the library, and I’ve just given the library a tape of one of the “Over Easy” TV segments that I did in 1980 with Craig Claiborne.\n\nQ:  Oh, great.\n\nNestle:  I got the tape, finally.  So there’s an archive at San Francisco State of those.  I did thirteen segments and they have ten of them that I was in.\n\nQ:  And next, Pet Food, but we will leave that for another—\n\nNestle:  Well, that book will come out in 2010.  So it’s now in the works.\n\nQ:  Thak you.  This is great.  We can save Pet Food for another—\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tNestle 3 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n","description":"Marion Nestle is the premiere food studies professional in the United States.

When his family sent him out as a restaurant apprentice, their goal was both to feed him and to teach him a trade. He discovered a passion for the work and his talent soon propelled him from the provinces, to the kitchens of French presidents, to one of New York's best restaurants. When a serious automobile accident made long hours in a restaurant impossible, he turned to teaching and then television.\r\n\r\nAlong the way he became a husband and father, an American citizen, a bestselling writer, and one of the guiding spirits of both the prestigious French Culinary Institute in Manhattan and the culinary program at Boston University.\r\n\r\nIncluded among his more than 20 books are arguably two of the most influential on cooking techniques ever written in this country, La Technique and La Methode. His eleven television series, with more on the way, have reflected both his years in America and a wide range of culinary possibilities, from cooking for celebrations to cooking with Julia Child.Interviewee:  Jacques Pépin\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\tNew York City\nDate: November 10, 2009\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  I am with Jacques Pépin.  It is November 10, 2009.  We are in his office at the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan.\nGood morning.\n\nPépin:  Good morning.\n\nQ:  I wonder if you could start by your telling me something about where and when you were born, and your childhood.  You’ve written about that very beautifully in the The Apprentice, but just to get you situated on this interview, if you’d talk about your family and your mother’s restaurant and so on.\n\nPépin:  I was born in Bourg-en-Bresse, which is a small town, not small town, but smaller than Lyon.  It’s about sixty kilometer east of Lyon going toward Geneva, and it’s a town quite well known for the chicken, the chicken of Bresse, B-r-e-s-s-e. with blue feet, red cockscomb and white plumage (bleu, rouge, blanc).  My mother was born there.  My father was born there as well, and my two brothers, I guess, were born there.\nI don’t remember as well as maybe I should from the time we are in Bourg, because when the war came and we stopped moving around and by then I was four, five years old.  My younger brother was born in 1940, and at some point my father went into the Resistance and left.  By then we had moved to L’Arbresle, I believe, which is a small town about thirty kilometer from Lyon, where my mother had a little restaurant and my father was still working as a cabinet maker that he was.  Actually, he was handling at that time the Galleries Lafayette, which is a big store in Lyon, and he was doing repair and arrangement for all the restoration of, you know, piece like sixteen, seventeen, eighteenth century type of furniture.\nAfter that, we move, and when my brother did his first communion, must have been, I don’t know, about eight years old, so I was six and a half when we moved to—no, prior to that, during the war, I was sent to a school first, St. Louis, which was a school, pretty tough, in Bourg-en-Bresse, was run by the Jesuit, and I was too young actually to go there, but my brother was taken, I think with the help of the Red Cross, and eventually they relented and let me join him, and I was certainly about five, six years old.  And it was pretty tough.  I still remember that when the water came out of the faucet in the morning, I find it was a stick of ice hanging.  The war had started by then, and we really had nothing to eat.  We had a piece of bread which we kept in a little drawer in the place where we were assigned to eat, and that piece of bread was like cement.  You had to bang it on the table for the little animal that were in there to come out before we ate it.  But, I mean, we did that in a matter of fact, because we didn’t really care.  This is the way things were.\nThat’s when I start doing a fair amount of bartering with other kid whose parents have farm and all that.  They would bring them a jar of [unclear] or a jar of honey or something that they do at the farm, and I would go around and exchange one thing or another, try to get something to eat.  But I don’t want to make it sound like it was horrible, because in that context this is the way life was, so we were all like that, the kids.  We still had fun and did whatever kids do at that age. \n\tDuring the summer, I was sent to a farm that my brother was sent to a farm as well in different parts for several year, and that was set up by the Red Cross.  By then I think my father had gone to the Resistance.  He went to the Resistance, I think ‘43.\n\nQ:  Did that mean he had to physically go to other places to live?  How did that impact your family?\n\nPépin:  Yes, we lived in Bourg still at that point, and, in fact, our house in Bourg, which was next to the railroad, the railroad which had a big bridge that led to Lyon, and my father used to work in the railroad.  If this is exact from what I’ve been told, when they come to pick him up, either the Gestapo or some other authority, he went through the window, jumped, and went through the railroad, which he knew well because he worked there, and kind of disappeared.  One of his reason to go may not be as glory that maybe should be, but I think it’s ’42 or so Hitler decided that all the men of a certain age were going to be sent to forced labor in Germany to one place or another.  At that time he was probably playing with the idea of joining the Resistance.  He had some friends in it, but that was probably the last draw.  Rather than go there, he said, “I’m leaving.”\n\tSo then the house was bombed the first time by the Italian, which destroy one side of the house where we lived.  My mother was working as a waitress and my two brother and I, or at least my other brother and I, were with my grandmother in the garden.  My grandmother—we had a garden, of course, tried to get some food, and so we were not hurt.  And the second time it was the American who tried to blow out the bridge, all this stuff, that blew that side of the house.  Maybe a few months later after it was repaired.  The third one was when the German left they blew up the bridge, and that blew that side of the house.  And three time we were not there, three time we were lucky, but each time my father had sneaked in town with some sardine or whatever he could find to bring to his wife.  Remember at the time there was no telephone or anything like this.  He came there, and then there was no more house.  So he would find us at some cousin or someplace.  But I’m sure the poor man must have been pretty traumatized each time.\nThat was basically what I remember at the time.  I remember one summer particularly where—the first time it was in a little farm in Foissiat, a small village that I went to spend the summer at a farm, and I still remember at that time when my mother left me.  I was probably five, five and a half, five, six.\n\nQ:  She left you where?\n\nPépin:  She left me at that farm.  She brought me there and left me with a farmer, and that was very traumatic for me the first couple of years.\n\nQ:  Without your brothers?\n\nPépin:  Yes, I was by myself.  My brother was in another farm, another village.  But I learned the farmer was very gentle.  They took me to milk the cow, the first time I was that close to an animal, and the first time I drank that milk, foaming and lukewarm just out of the udder, you know.  That things I remember about going to that farm during the summer, the stopping of the school year, we would have something to eat because the farmers grow their own thing.\nAnd then another time we were in another summer, I remember that well too, because we took the train with some other kid.  I think we slept in Chambéry in some type of barrack, army barrack, and we end up at the foot of the Alp.  I had never seen the Alp, I mean those mountain.  And it was the priest there who pick us up in his donkey, horse, I mean, kind of—what do you call—a buggy or whatever, attached to the horse or the donkey.  And we went all of that twisted mountain road for hours, and he finally left me in a farm there, and then continued up to another village higher to left my brother.\nThere I remember the woman doing the bread, because we made the bread twice a month.  They didn’t have any yeast at that time.  They start really making bread with the flour and water, and then a piece of the dough from the last two weeks before, which they kept in a jar in the cellar in water, and then that start natural yeast.  The dough starts rising bubbling and kind of died after a couple of hours, so they add flour to it, which they call rafraîchi, to refresh it, and it stop the bubbling again, and a third time, and a fourth time.  So it takes a day and a half to prepare that dough, which then they took to the oven in the village.  But all of the farm came that day, because that was only once every two week that they light up that big oven.  So we all did our bread, and then those put those bread like plates, you know, on shelf all around the thing of the—and they would take it and make a cross in the back, and cut long slice of bread.  When that oven was used for the bread, then they would continue putting some tarte in it or whatever they could have, or some stew, to continue using the heat of the oven overnight or so.\n\tSo that’s when I saw my brother, because that same oven use that other village, and then on Sunday also in church.  There was a church so that we could meet.\nIn 1993, I believe, I went to France for the Olympics.  I was invited by CBS.  I did some piece for CBS, and it was right in that area.  So we went with my brother and my daughter, Claudine, to those villages, where we looked for them.  I mean, the winter kept them of the world for like four, five month.  You see the old guy there that eat the bread they made, the cheese they made, because usually they had a couple of cow or four, five cow attached to the house, and the cheese and the prosciutto they make, dry ham, country ham too, and that’s basically what they are, with their knife, everything.  So it was basically the same thing.\nAnd we went to that famous oven that I wanted to see, and it was a rubble, piece of stone, because most of that rural village had been destroyed by the German, but that oven, which was not existing, except from, you know, a piece of rubble stone, was probably much smaller than I had it in my mind, the way it looked.\n\tBut in the second village, my brother went back to the house where he was, and the kid who was there, was an older kid, because my brother was seven, eight, that kid must have been ten years old, was still living there by himself.  His parents were gone a long time ago.\n\nQ:  Where had they gone?\n\nPépin:  Well, they were dead many years ago.  They died many years ago, because, I mean, that was in 1993, so he was already an older man.\n\nQ:  I see what you’re saying.\n\nPépin:  But he recognized my brother.  We opened the door.  He said Roland.  I couldn’t believe it.  And we came in.  Well, he still had his four cow and he was doing his milk the same way.  And my daughter was there.  She had never seen that, of course.  So that was a remembrance of those years, you know.\n\nQ:  Your mother, you said she was working as a waitress.  At what point did she have her own restaurants?\n\nPépin:  Well, after when we left Bourg, the first restaurant was in Neyron, then in l’Arbresle and finally in Lyons. Each time she opened a little restaurant or took over a little restaurant, and there I remember that we had pétanque—or, it’s not pétanque really there, it’s the boule Lyonnaise, a real nice boule game which is more similar to the bocce of Italy, and that was part of it, certainly part of my brother and I to clean it up and keep it in shape for the people who would come, from the priest to the lawyer to—of town, you know, playing with my father and drinking wine, and drinking wine by the liter.  They would count the bottle of wine, which was the poor of wine in Lyon is about half a liter.  They would line them up and we had left one liter of it or two.\nThere was that little river there, that, of course, was very attractive to my brother and I.  So we used to go to that river either creating some type of raft to go on this or going swimming or going fishing, even frying the fish there.  I used to take oil from my mother and some flour, and we would fry the fish there, you know.\nAnd then it was in Neyron, and my mother had a little restaurant called Hotel l’Amour there, and again, we had the chicken in the backyard.  I remember the chicken, I remember the little dog.  I remember also that we had the only cabine telephonique, you know, that is the telephone of the village, a little cabine.  So we had to, my brother and I, go miles to bring a telegram or message to people, which would give us one piece of sugar as a tip, so we walked a lot the mountain or the stuff around.  There I went to school also in Neyron after, and pretty much really we moved to l’Arbresle.\n\nQ:  You went to school there?\n\nPépin:  There, yes.  So that was primary—well, not primary school.  Probably I was eight years old or whatever.  And my brother went to school there also.  And eventually we moved to Lyon, where my mother had her first restaurant, Rue Chalopin called Chez Pepin in an area pretty—not the fancy area of Lyon, but pretty kind of tough neighborhood [La Guillotiere] now.  But she had a great little restaurant.  I remember that when I went to school and up to my certificate d’étude primaire which is a certificate of primary school, which was required at the time up to age fourteen you had to go to school.  But I was in that class when I was twelve years old.  My brother was very advanced also.  Well, he became an engineer.  So I stay in that class when I was thirteen, and asked for a dispensation, and when I was thirteen I was given a dispensation.  So I passed final exam, and I finish and I went into apprenticeship.  That’s what I wanted to do.  I didn’t want to stay in school.\n\nQ:  How did you know that?\n\nPépin:  Well, my mother had the restaurant, you know, and I loved the excitement, you know, of the restaurant.  My father was a cabinet maker by trade, was still working.  So we had kind of a blinder at the time, if you want, because I never thought that I could become a lawyer or a doctor.  It was so far from my family structure and my family.  We never thought in these terms.  There was no television, there was no radio, basically, and no magazine.  So life was pretty simple in that sense.  So that I was going to go in that direction, and that’s what I did, basically.  I left home when I was thirteen and a half.  Well, that’s fifty years.  That’s sixty years in August, you know.\nIn that fifty years last September I came to America.  And certainly apprenticeship wasn’t what it is today.  We were told that we were lucky enough to pay to learn.  The generation before us paid, but, of course, we will not pay.  We made money by—well, I went to pick up the lily of the valley like for the first of May, pick up watercress in some river that I know to resell to the hotel.  What else did we sell?  All kind of thing that was part of apprentice or helping, was helping the owner with a lot of his dog and all that, too.  Sometime I get a tip.  But basically I never asked one cent to my parents.  Whatever I could make, I pay for the bus once a month to take me back from Bourg to Lyon, because we had no day off.  We work seven day a week.  At the end of the month, they give you four days off for the four weeks, even though there is more than four weeks in a month.\n\tSo there I brought my apprentice jacket, pants, my towel, my toque, the sheet of my bed, all of that for my mother to wash, and then bring them back.  So, you know, we didn’t have pile of towel that you use like now.  We had those three towels that I washed and dried every night and put in a corner.  So I did a lot of mincing and chopping and working with the animal, and cleaning the stove, cleaning the thing, making mark on the bar of the stove with sandpaper to—I mean, this is totally useless, but part of the apprentice—\n\nQ:  What were the marks for?\n\nPépin:  Just to make it look good, but that’s what the apprentice work and all that, you know.  So a lot of that kind of rite of passage, if you want.  You know, you do those things.  I explain, I think, in that book that they send me to get a machine to bone out the chicken, which was, you know, a fake thing, which I came back walking toward town with cement block, whatever.  But this is what you did together, apprentice after you.\n\nQ:  And the hours that you worked were how many?\n\nPépin:  We work basically 8:00, 8:30 in the morning until 9:30, 10:00 at night, which was normal.  So we had a cut in the afternoon from two to five, normally, but one apprentice has to stand on guard to finish the stuff on the stove, and if you did something wrong, you get eight days—like in the army—eight days of guard, ten days of guard.  I was always on guard anyway, but that was fine.\nThe apprenticeship, which was supposed, again, to be almost three year was accelerated because what I was doing was, I guess, good enough, and I did a little more than two years, and I left for the summer to Aix [unclear].  Now that was to a summer spot, to do the season.  You did the season there, you signed for like four months, and we were in a bunker with other guy, and you worked four month straight.  There was no day off, because that was the season.  That was my second job, and then after I went back home to Lyon for a few weeks, and I work in Lyon for a few weeks, and then I left for Paris.  No, in the winter after I went to a small town called Bellegarde, between Lyon and Geneva, thirty kilometer from Geneva.  Then I was the chef there for the winter, because the owner had a daughter who was married to a chef, and the winter was really slow there, so he wanted a chef in one of the ski area.  So she took me as the chef.  That was my first job when I was seventeen, my first job as being in charge, you know.  That’s one of the first picture I have in that book of doing the Banquet des Pompiers, you know, the fireman banquet, because that was like a big deal.  I was seventeen, yes, winter when I went there.  So that was fun, but, you know, that was the way it was.  Yes, here I was.\n\nQ:  You mentioned at one point in the book that you were five-foot-two.\n\nPépin:  I was pretty small, yes.\n\nQ:  I’m not very tall, and I was thinking the other day as I was trying to cut something properly, vegetables, that it’s hard when you’re not tall enough to do that, and I was wondering how you managed to be successful at that.\n\nPépin:  Well, you get used to it.  When I worked with Julia with the table and stove, she had the thing in her kitchen built-up at least three or four inches higher than a commercial one, like thirty inches or thirty-one.  So, you know, I was like this.  But look at Sara Moulton, she is small and she managed. \n\nQ:  Well, you know what I was wondering very specifically was, okay, so it’s up to here, and you’re trying to use a knife like that, as opposed to like that.  I just wondered how as a young man you could do that.\n\nPépin:  Really at the time I don’t even remember.\n\nQ:  You don’t remember it being a problem?\n\nPépin:  I remember the stove bothering me.  When I come to the stove. It came to my chest and was really hot, and then there was a shelf above where you keep the plate, or at that time the platter, warm.  So I had to open the door, step on it to grab those things, the door of the oven, rather, because I was too small to reach.\nBut when I went to the stove after a year or so of apprenticeship, the chef decided one day, he said, “Tomorrow you start at the stove,” out of the blue.  I have never learned anything, I thought, but then I suppose you learn through a type of osmosis, because the chef tell you, “Do this,” and you would never even have thought of saying, “Why?” because if you had said, “Why?” he would have said, “Because I just told you.”  That would be the end of the explanation.  But somehow you learn, you know, as I say, by osmosis, and you don’t know the name of any sauce, anything.  You are the chef, you take that sauce, which mean nothing at all, but that was the way things were learned, and not necessarily bad for someone that age, you know, repeat.\n\nQ:  Tell me about going to Paris.\n\nPépin:  I had a friend actually there at the Hotel de l’Europe, who was the premier commis.  So after the apprentice, we are three apprentice, we had a commis.  Then there was the chef.  Well, that commis was Robert something.  I forget his name.  But Robert I know was his first name.  So he went to Paris.  So I had his address, and he told me, “Oh, you should come to Paris,” whatever.  So when I finish in Bellegarde that spring, I decided to go to Paris.  So I was seventeen years old.\n\nQ:  Did you discuss it at all with your family?\n\nPépin:  Oh, sure.  I told my mother.  I don’t know if my mother had been to Paris.  She may have been there once, but I’m not even sure.  But I said, “No, no, I have a job.  I have a friend,” and so forth, which I didn’t have, of course.\nSo I arrived at Gare de Lyon there with my suitcase, and then I had the address of that friend there, which he didn’t know that I was coming, because we didn’t even write at that time, I guess.  So I walk through quite a long distance with my suitcase to finally get to his door, and knock at the door.  Fortunately, he was there with a woman or whatever, so they let me stay overnight, and the day after I went to La Société Des Cuisiniers, the Paris society of the chef of Paris, and got a job, and eventually got a room and so forth.\n\nQ: That Society is an unusual thing for Americans to understand.  Could you just explain a little bit how it worked?\n\nPépin:  Yes, it’s a thing that I really think we should have here.  It’s an organization of chef, where you become a member and you are just there depending on what position you are in the kitchen, where you work, the commis, first commis, chef de partie, you know, head of one department or whatever, and you pay your due.  When you need a job, you go there and you get a job for the day.  That is, when you own a restaurant and someone doesn’t show up in the morning, whatever, you call Société and say, “I need two commis,” or, “I need two—,” whatever.  So when you go there, there is like a waiting room, and you register, and then you wait until they call you on the PA system, but every day there is a traffic of chefs here.  I don’t know of many people going and getting job.\n\tIn addition to this, there was La Grille in Paris—La Grille name after a restaurant on the Rue St. Roch, R-o-c-h, which is next to La Société des Cuisiniers de Paris, and that was an informal thing that every Wednesday afternoon during the cut—we still work with a cut at the time in Paris, between two and five in the afternoon—you would go in that street.  That street was full of maybe two thousand chef.  You know, that was an informal meeting where the chef come, shake hand, talk about their business, this, that, too, and there was a bistro in the middle of that, with a big iron gate in front of La Grille, so they called it La Grille for the iron gate.  So on Wednesday afternoon you go to La Grille.  I think it still exist, and there are a lot of deal out there.  The guy say, “I’m looking for a commis to go there for two weeks.”  There was a lot of those type of deal going on there as well, you know.  So I did that later on, not at the beginning, but later on I would go to La Grille.\n\nQ:  And about how old would you have been when you went there?\n\nPépin:  Well, I started in Paris when I was seventeen, you know, so—\n\nQ:  But then you went on Wednesday afternoons, how old were you?\n\nPépin:  Oh, maybe the year after.  So I work in, you know, very good place in Paris, the Meurice Hotel and Plaza Athénée and so forth, but my day off I would go to La Société or La Grille, or sometime I have two, three day off and I would work.  I probably working in two hundred restaurant in Paris, because I worked my day off, which was a very good training because it’s not like going to a restaurant and you have to get used to the restaurant for a week or two week, the chef take over.  There you work there for the day or maybe two days, so the chef say, “Go to the sauce,” or, “Go to whatever department you are needed,” and there if you ask someone, “Well, what do I do?” he say, “Well, look at the menu.”  You go get your food and there is a steward giving you the food, and you have to start cooking.  I mean, you know, so it’s quite a training doing it that way.\n\nQ:  Why did you do that while you already had a job somewhere else?\n\nPépin:  Well, to make some money for my day off.  I try always to make money, so—\n\nQ: Was it also interest or was it strictly—\n\nPépin:  It was interest as well.  You know, I mean, I work from the highest restaurants in Paris to the soup kitchen, you know, where I had to remember there was stew with meat, which was already smelly and slime, so I didn’t even want to taste it.  The old guy would come line up, and we would serve them this food, plate after plate.  I mean, a soup kitchen, you know, for poor people.  So different training than working at the Plaza Athénée or Maxim, and it was good.\n\nQ:  At what point did you realize that you were very good at this?\n\nPépin:  I never thought that I was very good at that.  You move forward.  Fortunately, I wasn’t married, I didn’t have any burden.  The room were really inexpensive.  We didn’t make much money, but we spent it, and then after we didn’t have any, didn’t really matter that much.\nBut I always wanted to learn more from someone else.  So I always end up working in bigger place, more prestigious place where you make less money, but you learn.  This is certainly a thing that even the people who are at the French culinary Institute here, some are older and they already have two kid or whatever.  When they come out, they say, “I got to make money.”  If they don’t have to make money, then they go work for Jean Georges or Daniel or a Per Se, make practically no money, but learn and eventually it pays off.  So it’s a different route, and I could take that route because I really didn’t have any—so that’s what I did.\n\nQ:  You also wrote that I think it was the Plaza Athénée had a library that you—\n\nPépin:  Yes.\n\nQ:  And what kinds of books were there?\n\nPépin:  Well, I still have one, which is at home that I still have it, and it’s Dante Inferno.  So the Inferno was first part of The Divine Comedy.\n\nQ:  In French or Italian?\n\nPépin:  No, in French, of course.  La Divine Comedie, The Divine Comedy of Dante was in three part, I think it was the Inferno this one, or whatever, and so there was a very good book.  I started being a bit of an autodidact, if you want, at the time, start learning and reading books that I have never had access to.\nAnd another thing which was very important is that movie theaters were very expensive at the time going to the movie that we wanted to.  One thing which was really cheap was going to La Comedie Française, which was the greatest theater in France.  There were two Comedie Française theaters in Paris, one at Luxembourg and the other one near the Palais Royale, and there if you wait in line and to go to the top you pay the amount of what you would pay for a coffee, I think really nothing.  So I start going for lack of a better thing to do with a couple of friend, and then we got interested and we keep going, and probably through the whole repertory usually starting around Molière, sixteenth century, sometime a little earlier, and then the same thing with the Opera Comique.  The Opera Comique, you know,  La Fille de Madame Angot or the Contes d’Hoffmann, you know, where if you waited in line there you could go to the poulailler or top floor, really the top, and pay really very little money also to see those.  So we started doing that.  So I kind of start learning and getting book at the library.\nThe difference between those restaurants are from very crowded area, no place to change, literally, and making more money.  At the Plaza Athénée, we had a very nice place to change, we had a shower for the commis, another shower for the chef de partie.  We had a restaurant for the employee, where you go and have your dinner.  On your day off, you could come there.  They had a little rowboat on the Seine River.  They had a basketball or soccer team, and then the library, and a medical nurse there.\n\nQ:  That’s very civilized.\n\nPépin:  So, yes, it’s a big hotel, a nice place to work.\n\nQ:  At that point, did you have any thought about wishing you had stayed in school longer or no?\n\nPépin:  No, not really.  Not really.  In some ways, you know, in other way, maybe yes.  We all are kind of complex about that.  I mean, you would go out.  If you go out somewhere and go dancing, I mean, in France it’s pretty common to go by yourself, and you’re going to invite someone to dance.  My brother, at that time, came after.  My brother never had any complex about anything.  My younger brother was a big bull, big bully and too a very nicest guy.  But someone ask you what you do, say, “I’m a cook at the Plaza Athénée,” that wasn’t very, very high, because during that time the cook was certainly at the bottom of the social scale, even though we are genius today.  So I don’t know what happened.  [laughter]  We change a great deal.\n\nQ: And at what point, then, did you decide you would try New York?  Actually, first I should go back first.  Let’s get you through the army.\n\nPépin:  But even that, before going into the army there was a chef, the pastry chef—I forget his name.  It was an old man at the time, and he had worked in Chicago and he talked to me about America.  He said, “You should go to America.  It’s terrific.”  So I always wanted to travel.\n\nQ:  Where did you meet that pastry chef?\n\nPépin:  He was at the Plaza Athénée.  He was the executive pastry chef there.  We were about fifty in the kitchen, chef, that is, about a hundred twenty in the kitchen with dishwasher and coffee makers, storerooms, stewards and all that.  It was a big place.  And there were about fifteen in the pastry shop, and that executive chef talked to me about New York.  There was other people traveling, so it kind of inflamed my imagination.  And he say, “You know, if you are interested, I can put you in touch with some people.”\n\tI said, “Great.”\nThen I went into the army.  I was called in the army in ’56 because it was the war, the war in Algeria.  Not because it was the war in Algeria, but because it was mandatory, and eighteen month in the army.  I end up staying thirty, twenty-eight months, I think.  Because of Algeria, they would keep you three more months, three more months, and so forth.  And certainly we, La Société Des Cuisiniers de Paris, they had an arrangement with the navy, because conventionally the navy had only drafted—not drafted people, enrolled people, I mean enlisted people, rather.  Except for chef, because people eat really well in the navy, and each of the small ship or whatever would have his own chef or several chef, and they all go to the market with a first Petty Officer or whatever it may be, and had to control your money and all that, but buy and cook specifically for that ship.  It’s not like the whole army like here eat the same way.  Not there.  They all eat different, and that will be different depending on the chef that they have.\n\nQ:  A chef for each ship?\n\nPépin:  The chef of each of the ship, yes.  So often they try to draft at that point some professional chef, like me, that they have in Paris, the arrangement with La Société Des Cuisiniers de Paris again, you know, the Society.  And of course they expect to eat, you know, from lobster to whatever for Christmas or stuff.  So you have to save your money, you know, like you do in a kitchen, to try to work out your menu and get enough money.\nSo I was drafted into the navy and I went for boot camp in Hourtin, which is a place in the southwest of France, near Arcachon, there where they have the oyster, for my boot camp for three month or whatever it was.  And at that point, everyone was going to Algeria.  I was pretty good shape physically.  So we passed some test, and I end up being good for the service in sea, good for this, and good for kind of—well, they called a little bit like the marine here, which would be called a fusilier in France, which is—\n\nQ:  How do you say that again?\n\nPépin:  Fusilier marin.  Not an elite troop, but more of a—certainly not on the ship, more in campaign and all that.  So my mother was crazy when I told her I was all proud of myself, I was ready to go to Algeria, but then my brother was there, because we are sixteen months’ difference, and he was already in Sidi Bel Abbes in Algeria, and because he was an engineer, a [unclear] school engineer so he was already—I think he was a sergeant or lieutenant, whatever.  So at that time there was a law in France, they didn’t send two draftees at the same time.\n\nQ:  From the same family?\n\nPépin:  Yes, if you enlisted, it’s different, but draftee, one at a time.\n\nQ:  To Algeria?\n\nPépin:  To Algeria, yes.  So I was sent back to Paris to work as part of the crew in a café  La Pepinière, on the Place St. Augustin, which is the center of the navy in Paris, with about three or four hundred navy barracks, or maybe five sailors, I don’t know how many there, but a big mess-hall for the admiral.  So I was sent to the mess-hall of the admiral, and the chef, the people who were the officer there, and the petty officer and all that were all usually from Brittany, and didn’t know anything about cooking, would yell at you, but then they liked to have people like me coming on the outside to serve, because they were in kind of a loss with the food.\n\nQ:  People like you meaning well trained?\n\nPépin:  People who came from big restaurant in Paris or whatever.  So I was there, I don’t know, maybe two, three month, and then I met a young guy who was from Lyon, and we became friends.  We knew a lot of people restaurant chefs in Lyon. And eventually when he left, because he was almost finished when I met him, he went to France and worked with my mother, and eventually bought back her restaurant and all that.  So we became very, very friend with George [Roussillon].  So George and his wife, even, worked as a waitress with my mother restaurant.  They work together for many, many year, but he had never worked in Paris.  He only worked in Lyon.\nSo then he was assigned to the secretary of treasurer as a chef, and at that time it was—I forget his name [Paul Ramadier?], but anyway, the secretary of treasurer lived in a pretty beautiful place.  On one side is the Musée du Louvre and on the other side the former apartment of Napoleon II and all that, the minister, the secretary of treasurer on the Rue de Rivoli.  The kitchen there you could probably have during the time of Napoleon, maybe two hundred people in the kitchen.  It was still a vaulted ceiling with the fleur-de-lis, you know, and absolutely ice cold in winter.  In a corner we are two little stove doing the stuff, but the place was enormous.  So he said, “Could you come there and give me a hand for—I have some dinner, state dinner or whatever.”\n\tI said, “Yes, are you kidding?  Great.”  So he asked where he was, and whoever was there called the big boss at the Pepinière barrack, and I was sent to help George to make dinner, and eventually I stay there with Ramadier. The government changed, and the new government was changed, was Félix Gaillard as secretary of treasurer, and I worked with them much more than George  worked with them, and eventually he left and I was alone with them.  So I knew—\n\nQ:  Them meaning who?\n\nPépin:  Alone with the secretary of treasurer there, as the chef, that is.  I had a dishwasher or whatever, but I was alone doing dinner six, ten, eight and so forth, going to the market, doing my stuff.\nAnd then the government under the Fourth Republic, the government was changing at very rapid pace in France, like in Italy it would be there.  So the government, I think it was Guy Mollet was the Prime Minister.  At that time, during the Fourth Republic, the Prime Minister had more power than the President of the Republic.  He was like the Queen of England.  He had no authority power.  It was the Prime Minister, Président du conseil, so called, a minister, and which is on the 57 Rue de Varenne next to the Musée Rodin, that’s where Matignon, Hôtel Matignon, which has the largest private park, private park in Paris.  It’s beautiful.  It was a hotel in the sixteenth century, the hotel of the Duke of Matignon.\n\tSo, anyway, the government changed again, and Félix Gaillard was elected Prime Minister there.  So they rush me there, and I remember the first lunch.  The President was at the Senate or the Chamber of Deputy and had to do a lunch for six people or eight, so I rushed through the street.  I think I remember I had veal chop that I did with mushroom or whatever.  I forget what I did for dessert, but I started, and then I was basically in charge there.\n\nQ:  Was it an official move?\n\nPépin:  It was an official move.  And at that point, however, there was the major domo here, and there was a lot of people which were usually in charge of everything and buying everything and all that, and the cook was not that high on that social scale.  However, when I came, they only knew me, so not only the President, but the director of cabinet, Aicardi, and the chef of cabinet, Yuon Autard, his name was, they call me.  They say, “Pépin, we need the flowers in that.”  They need whiskey in that thing, and they asked me like—those guys were crazy.  I was taking over.  I was young.  I was twenty-one.  I had a discussion with them.  I said, “Look.  I don’t want to take any of your priority and all that, but you leave me the food.”  So they left me the food.  So I say I’ll do my market and we get some tip, you know, from the vendor at the time and all that, for that type of stuff. \n\tSo I did that for not too long, maybe a couple of month, because Féix Gaillard was a very wealthy man.  He was a member of the “two hundred families,” they call in Europe, with his wife too.  So he had a very fancy house on Avenue Foch, with a chef, with all that, so that usually went home.  But then the one who stayed at Matignon was Aicardi, called the director of cabinet, secretary to the nuclear energy or whatever, and he was a real gourmet.  I mean, he was crazy about food, even though he didn’t drink wine.  You know, it was crazy.  But I remember serving him with an attack of gout, with his leg in the air, and he couldn’t eat, and by himself.  Me ordering a truites saummone. Not a salmon or a trout, but a salmon trout, which is a slightly different species, with a mousseline sauce, which is hollandaise with whip cream in it, I mean stuff like that which would be too rich.\nSo it was with him that I start buying—he said, “Chef, bring me your cookbook.”  I didn’t have any cookbook.  So I bought Bons Plats, Bons Vins by Curnonsky, the big book of the time, and I would come with the book and he would open it, and say, “Okay.  I want that.”  And that was a poularde with truffle, all truffle around and stuff that even at that time you couldn’t even serve in restaurant.  You would have lost your shirt.  I mean, it was more the kind of cuisine which was developed by, Manon for the nobility before the French Revolution, and certainly by Carême later on.  So that type of cuisine was already kind of passé, because it was very expensive, complicated—so this was the type of cuisine that we did.\nSo at some point there was a commandant there in charge of the internal security and all that.  It was pretty lax.  Anyone would come see me, they go downstair, they call me, they came up.  I say, “You know, I need a pastry chef there, because I don’t have—,” and that’s when they send me Jean-Claude, my friend who is still my friend now, and which I was still working him at B.U. last week.\nSo they send me Jean-Claude, who had worked at Drouant and two or three, you know, big restaurants in Paris.  So he knew what he was doing.  And so we became a great team.  At the time when we only had two person for dinner or one sometimes, then I would leave him and I would go and do extra at Société de Cuisiniers de Paris again, make money, so we could split, because we didn’t make much money in the army.  Or he would go or I would go, you know.  So we still worked this way.\n\tSo it was a great time because we had extraordinary product.  I mean, certainly you had Androuet, the cheesemaker, who would come every day with a tray of cheese, fresh, with a name on it.  We used it once. Then after, we give the rest to the employees.  I mean, we had oyster.  Pruniers, which is our best restaurant, would come.  The ecalier, which is oyster shucker, would wait until they sit down and open double Belon..\nOne time the Minister of Foreign Affairs went to Russia and came back with three can of caviar like this.  Those things were like not five kilo, but two and half kilo, like five pound of Beluga, you know.  So we gorge ourself on caviar.  I did all kind of dish with it.  When they went hunting, President’s guests hunting in government land, then they would bring back like twelve pheasant or stuff, which I would transform into pâté or do other type of thing with it.\nSo it was exciting, and we learn our métier there, because, you know, we are not that knowledgeable at the age that we were, but we had worked in good place.  We did state dinner like with Eisenhower, Nehru, Tito, Macmillan, who were the heads of state at the time.  But certainly we were never once applauded or called for kudo, or even anyone come in the kitchen to thank us or whatever.  That didn’t exist, period.\n\nQ:  Technically, were you working for the government, for the person, for the navy?\n\nPépin:  I was still part of the navy, but I was at the government.  So I was working for the government there, but I was still in the navy.\n\nQ:  So it was a navy salary?\n\nPépin:  Oh, yes.  I had just whatever.  Goodness knows, I didn’t get any money there.\nBy the time my brother finish in Algeria, I think he did twenty-six or twenty-eight months also.  He came back.  I should, theoretically could have been sent, but at that time I think I was seventeen months in the army, and I was theoretically, you know, to be released in a month—the official time was eighteen month.\nAnd then at the spring, there was Pflimlin, Pierre Pflimlin, who became the President for like three, four weeks, whatever, during very complicated time in France, the early 1968, when they were the Committee of Salut Publique formed in Algeria by rebel general, General Salan.  Colonel Massu they were going to take over the government, that when they ask De Gaulle, and De Gaulle came back to power the 12 of May ’58, when I was there, I remember the whole night doing sandwich for the press and all that, because it was like mayhem.  The General came as Prime Minister, the head of state, and Minister of the War, and Minister of Defense Nationale.  I think he had three portfolio and with his staff, or general, you know, the Colonel de Bonneval, Captain Sabot, and then Madame de Gaulle, of course.  And at that point I hadn’t had a mistress, if you want, there to tell me what to do, because Gaillard lived in his own house.  So there I started, you know, meeting, well, almost every day, two, three times a week with Madame de Gaulle to go to set up the menu for the week.\n\nQ:  With her?\n\nPépin:  Yes, to know what she wanted, except for state dinner, which you meet with the protocol people, because if, like, Eisenhower received the French President at the American Embassy, and then they have dinner at the Quai D’Orsay, the protocol, we’d synchronize what they ate there, so that we don’t have three time the same fish or whatever they have.  Depending whether the dinner is very long or whether two entrée or one entrée, short, you know, there is all kind of thing that you—and then, of course, if you have the King of Morocco you’re not going to serve a roast of pork, or the Prime Minister of India, you know, beef, or stuff like this, and other characteristics, so that they would tell you, so that you set up your menu accordingly.\nBut then on Sunday they were a very devout Catholic, the family would eat together.  De Gaulle children, grandchildren, everybody would have the Sunday meal, and at that time what the menu of Madame de Gaulle that she wanted, usually very straightforward bourgeois type of cuisine, you know, the beautiful maybe a roast of lamb.  We never serve on plate at the time, of course; serve on platter.  And maybe whole fish or  maybe a cheese soufflé to start, and maybe a caramel custard for dessert, the cheese, salad in between, simple but very classic and good quality.  So that was the way it was.\n\tAnd then when de Gaulle came, he was a very ethical man.  He didn’t want anyone to be what they call “planqué,” you know, in French, which mean not doing your duty.  So that’s when they could have sent me in Algeria, but I was practically finished, you know, even though I stay another almost a year, another year, yes.  So Claude went to Algeria.  They sent him to Oran, actually, and so they send me two officer, one in charge, Daniel Le Servor, which was from the navy, and Jackie from the army, other pasty chef who was a sergeant chef, you know.  Those guys never cook—well, they had cooked in their life, but in the barrack too, so they were totally out of their mind.  They had absolutely no idea what to do.  So they came, they told me, “You’re the chef.  We’ll do whatever you want.  Just tell us what to do.”  I mean, he would do a big burgundy and put slice of tomato around to look nice, you know.  [laughs]\n\tSo I was in the ironic position that they make breakfast for me in the morning.  I came, I was the chef, they were the officer.  So they stay with me, and actually Marcel le Servot stay after long time.  He was with Giscard d’Estaing when he retired eventually.  He the one that did that famous soup with Bocuse.  I told the chef and Bocuse did the soup, “Il faut casser le croute,” you know, break the crust with the truffle, and it is truffle soup.  And actually, he died a few years ago.  I was sent an article in the paper.  He was retired.  He was in Brittany.  He was from Brittany, like most marin, navy, and he was in a field.  He had a tractor, and his tractor was tilted.  Something happened.  He went down, the tractor fall onto him, and he died this way.\n\nQ:  You stayed there—\n\nPépin:  Until October, November of—the end of the year in ’58.  And they asked me if I wanted to stay, actually, and they had started changing the government, and the constitution changed, I think, in January 1959, just after I left, to become the Fifth Republic was now the power of the Prime Minister would move to the President to the change, and De Gaulle went to the Elysée then from there, and I started back at the Plaza Athénée [restaurant].\nBut at that time already, when I was with de Gaulle, I wanted to go to—I still was going to the Plaza Athénée and talking to people my day off.  I lived in Paris, you know, I had my room.  I took my room back in town.  I didn’t go to the caserne [barrack] except to get my salary at the end of the month or for one or the other reason.  So I asked the chef, and he told me, “No, no, I can get you in touch with somebody in New York and all that.  It’s a friend of mine.  He come during the summer.”  And I started in the Plaza Athénée again, and that spring he introduced me to Ernest Lutringhauser, who had an Alsacian with a restaurant on 50th and First Avenue called La Toque Blanche.  And he say, “Absolutely, if you want to come.”  It was very easy to go at the time, and the reason is that—and in addition to this, I went to see a conseiller diplomatique of the general when I worked in the government, because then I had decided that.  “I want to go to America.”\n\tHe say, “Okay.  Go see one of my friend at the American Embassy.”  It happened to be the consul, which I didn’t even know.  So they gave me the paper.  I fill out the paper, and I had six month to go, and I think I left eight month after I passed even the thing, because I wasn’t ready to go that fast.  And the reason is that at that time they had quota for France, they had quota for each of the European country, and France never really—not that many people expatriate themselves, like something, for example in Belgium or whatever.  It was different.  Like in Italy they had to wait ten years because a third of the country move in the thirties, you know.  So there were so many people of Italian coming to—so they were penalized in that way, and I think it was in the seventy they changed and made it by blocks, so now we wait two, three, four years, whatever.  But at the time was quite easy to come.\n\nQ:  And you wanted to for what reason?\n\nPépin:  Just to see.  I mean, everyone wanted to come to America.  It was the Golden Fleece, you know.  The El Dorado.  I mean, you wanted to come.  We had the jazz during the war, and we had all of that allure, you know, and all America.  I didn’t really have any intention of staying, but I wasn’t attached.  I say, “I’ll go for a year, two years, and see and come back.”  The first day I was in New York, I loved it and never went back.\nBut I left on a student boat.  My mother and my father, I still remember, drove me to Le Havre, and took on that boat called L’Ascania, and I still remember seeing them disappearing.  I went to Le Havre not too long ago, but it’s so different now.  At that time it was.  And it was a twelve-day trip, and it was at least 1,200 students, American students coming back from Europe, from Russia, from France, from all over.  We saw two Aurora Borealis, finish in Quebec, and I took the train to Montreal.  Montreal, took the train, and I arrive in New York with my suitcase at Grand Central.  That’s how I came.\nAnd then I had met a guy here on boat, and trying my very poor English on—one was playing guitar and singing at night, and I met a guy who spoke French and who was a professor, I think, and he lived in Larchmont, just outside of New York there, and I asked him, “You know, I think I want to go back to school.  What is the best school?”\n\tHe said, “Columbia.”\n\tI said, “Fine.”  So I never heard of Columbia.  I went there, went to Columbia, and like two day after I was here, I worked at Le Pavillon, was introduced by Ernest to Pierre Franey, and learn how to take the subway in the first week.  Went to Columbia, struggled to go somewhere and get enrolled eventually in English for foreign students, you know.\n\nQ:  Let me ask you about that.  You knew that your workday was going to be long, arduous, and yet you still enrolled at Columbia.\n\nPépin:  Yes, but much better.  I mean, there for the first time in my life we did the day in one shot.  In France, remember, we start 8:30 in the morning, finish at 2:00, start at 5:00, finish at 10:00.  So often you live farther, two, three hours in there, we go play Ping-Pong or somewhere or go to the Jardins des Tuileries, but we couldn’t do anything.  Here, I was night chef, you know, so—\n\nQ:  At Le Pavillon?\n\nPépin:  Yes.  So I started in the morning, after one night shift.  Anyway, if you start in the morning, you start at 9:00 or whatever, and you finish at 2:30 in the afternoon, that’s your day off.  You’ve done your seven, eight hours.  If you start at three o’clock in the afternoon, you finish at eleven o’clock at night.  So for me it was almost like half a day off.  I said, “Wow.”  That was much better.\n\tSo it worked out at least, I say I learn the language properly.  So I went to Columbia, and I went for, I think, two years.  I did well enough to be enrolled into intermediate class, because I had learned and read in France, and went to take some class in Paris to an English school called Gardener. I couldn’t understand what people were saying, but writing, I wasn’t too bad.  So I end up in that intermediate class, which I couldn’t really understand much.\n\nQ:  English for—\n\nPépin:  For intermediate, yes.  So I did the first semester.  I passed my exam.  I went to the second one, and then advance, more advance.  Then English for freshman after, at the end.  So that was the end of that program, which was not credited, of course.  And then I decided that I wanted to continue in school.  I asked an advisor.  He told me, “Well, you know, we do have a validation program.  Go there to see whether you’re qualified.”\n\tThey said, “Well, we take an exam twice a year.”  Like five hundred people in an auditorium, on tape mostly, and they messed up with mathematic and ask you about an addition, one and one, and subtraction and multiplication and the fraction and whatever, and you stopped whenever you couldn’t go on, and the same thing basically with more subject, you know, just to get a reading of—and somewhat I was—I pass enough to get into that validation program, where I had to keep a B average, and cover that class-- that class a two years period..\nI took the hardest class I ever took in my life here, which was a refresher of four years of high school mathematic, algebra, geometry, and maybe a trifle of trigonometry also.  So, first, I had never done it.  Secondly, it was in another language, so it took me like three weeks before I understood the language of the subject.  [laughter]\n\tBut then I find a guy who saved my life when I work at Howard Johnson, and the guy in charge of the office was a former high school teacher of mathematic, Jack Bixgorin.  I still remember his name.  And he loved food.  And, you know, in the test kitchen I cook all the time.  I said, “Okay, I’ll show you how to cook, and could you coach me on this?”  So he did, and somewhat I passed that exam, which was probably the hardest thing that I’ve done, and from then on I went into first year of calculus, which I don’t remember anything or whatever, but at least I learned that, which was just a step.  I forget what other class that I had, but I finish that program, and I kept the B, not in mathematic, but I got maybe higher somewhere else so I could—and then I was admitted in the regular college for a B.A. in general study.  Already I had some credited point from that validation program.  I had some credit.  So after it was more of a question of continuing, and more a question of endurance, of stubbornness than anything, you know.  [laughs]\n\tSo I finished my B.A. and then went into the graduate school.  I mean, I went for a Ph.D., actually, and I did a master along the way, on Voltaire.  I did a thesis on Voltaire.  But I proposed my doctoral dissertation, they said, “Are you crazy?”  In 1968 I wanted to write on this area of food, in the context of civilization and literature, French food.  And they say, “Are you crazy?”  Even the people in the French Department, they said “Oh, pouf.  It’s not academic.”\n\tI said, “Well, I’m not going to spend a year of my life on a demonstrative pronoun or whatever.”\nSo I did the language requirement.  I did the sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteenth century qualifying exam.  So I had to do the twentieth century and my thesis, basically.  That’s what I had to do left, and then I gave up.\n\nQ:  How much of this was while you were at Pavillon?\n\nPépin:  I don’t know.  At the Pavillon, I only stay—I was at Howard Johnson during that time, most of that time.\n\nQ:  I know.  I was wondering, so—\n\nPépin:  Howard Johnson, I worked from 1960 to 1970, ten years.  You know, at the Pavillon I only worked seven months.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  This is a continuation of my interview with Jacques Pépin.\nCould we talk about Le Pavillon and your leaving with Pierre Franey?\n\nPépin:  Well, the Pavillon, as I said, I worked from September ’59, when I came here, and until—I don’t know, it was May, the spring of 1960.  So I didn’t work long at the Pavillon, because Pierre had problem with Soulé, and he decided to quit.  Pierre had come for the Exposition of 1939.  He was there a long, long time.  He came as a commis to become the executive chef, but Soulé was kind of a tyrant there, and I was never particularly impressed by Soulé, he was supposed to be a great—but in any case, Pierre decided to leave because Soulé didn’t want to give us an increase in pay.  There was a problem.  So, for me, who was used to working in Paris with chef, where you support your chef, so I kind of mounted a revolution in the kitchen, said, “We all have to quit,” you know.\nAnd then I was approached the same night by two gentlemen with a strange hat and put against the wall.  I mean, Local 89 was mafia, you know.  My English was not too good, but I understood that they lift me up against the wall, that I better shut up, whatever.  So I say, “Okay.”\n\nQ:  Who sent those men, do you think?\n\nPépin:  The union.  The union.  It was Local 89.\nSo anyway, I said, “Well, we can quit one person a day or two,” which is what we did.  And then I was the night chef.  I said, “No, I don’t want to do extra hours,” which I have the right to refuse.  So basically by the time I was ready to serve dinner, I had two people left in the kitchen, because people just were doing—or quit each day.  So I couldn’t cover everything, of course, and so Soulé had to stay like that for almost a week, and then he had to close the restaurant.\n\nQ:  You decided to stay with Pierre Franey?\n\nPépin:  Well, yes.  Well, no.  At that point, Roger Fessaguet was the sous chef and Robert Meyzen was the maître d’ of the Pavillon, quit, as well, to open La Caravelle.  They were going to open La Caravelle, you know.  So I work in the meantime at the St. Regis for three weeks, you know, a couple of place here and there.  And Roger wanted me to come to Le Caravelle, and Pierre wanted me to go to Howard Johnson with him.  I kind of said, “What am I going to do?”  And then eventually I went to Howard Johnson with Pierre.\n\nQ:  Why did you do that?\n\nPépin:  Because it was another world and I wanted to work with Pierre.  I didn’t want to work in another French restaurant.  I wanted to work in more of an American environment and so forth.  And then I was asked to go to the White House that spring, and the reason that was because there was—well, you can read that in my book.  There was that problem at the Pavillon where the Kennedy group left, started going to La Caravelle, and Roger call me, “You want to go to the White House?”\nAnd I have to say Pierre Franey could have said, “It’s great opportunity for you,” but he didn’t want me to leave.  So he say, “Well, you can go if you want,” but, you know.  But I had my friend in New York.  I was at Columbia and also the fact that I had been the chef in France with the President and never been on the radio and newspaper, never had any kudo.  So I didn’t realize the potential publicity because it didn’t really exist at the time.  The chef was really at the bottom of the social scale. And certainly if you ask who was the chef before René Verdon-- because Jacqueline Kennedy start pushing.  You would never know [if] it was a black woman who was there in the kitchen.  It was just like in France at the time.  The chef had no recognition whatsoever, you know.  It started probably with the Kennedy.  But for me I did refuse to go because I had no inkling of the potential of publicity, and I had started putting roots in New York and also going to Columbia, and I didn’t want to move, you know.\n\nQ:  How was the work at Howard Johnson’s described to both of you?  What was your challenge?\n\nPépin:  Well, it was Director of Research and Development.  We were totally open-ended because Mr. Johnson, which you have his picture here from my wedding, he came, that was Howard D. Johnson, which is the man who created Howard Johnson’s, who is here and his wife, had talked to Pierre already, because he was a customer of the Pavillon all the time, and he had met Pierre.  And he said, “One day you’re going to work for me.”\n\tPierre said, “Well,” and he did.  So we really could do whatever we wanted.  So I started doing ten pound of beef burgundy in the kitchen, then trying to do fifty pound in a kettle, and end up doing three thousand pound at the time.  I had started working with a chemist, so I learned words like specific gravity, you know, chloroform, bacteria, stuff that we had to contend with, and then we were chef.  I said, “What if we don’t brown it?  We’ll do an experiment.”  So we saved 10 percent of the weight if we do this, that, too.  So we started cooking, experimenting.\nIt was pretty fascinating for me to have—even at the Pavillon I don’t think I learned much.  I worked in better place in Paris.  But at Howard Johnson was really my American apprenticeship for ten years, well, a totally different world and in a totally American environment.  At that time I worked seven o’clock in the morning, three in the afternoon, and outside of school I took another job too.  I work in the [unclear].  I remember it up when Claudine was just born not long.  I worked so much, because I finished at three o’clock.  I went there and finished at midnight.  I came home, I collapse and sleep.\nDuring that time, we were robbed in the apartment.  I never saw it.  My wife was gone because after Claudine was born, she had a fibroid thyroid tumor operated on here, and so Claudine and her went to some friend of ours in the country just outside of Pawling—not long from New York, and I was doing two job a day.  I say, “Why don’t you go there two, three weeks.  You relax.  You know, I’m just collapsing at night.”  And during that time, they robbed the apartment, all her jewelry.  I never saw it.  She saw it three weeks after when she came back.\n\nQ:  So you got married during the time that you were at Howard Johnson’s?\n\nPépin:  Yes, I got married in ’66, and Howard Johnson came to my wedding, too, yes.  I had met my wife skiing.  I was a ski instructor over the weekend, so—\n\nQ:  You were?\n\nPépin:  Yes.  Always doing a thing which will—like that.  We had the prestige of the uniform and we didn’t pay for the thing, and I learn how to ski better.  I didn’t really know how to ski when I came here.  So she was in the ski patrol anyway.  She took classes with me there, and [unclear].\n\nQ:  What kinds of changes did you make on the Howard Johnson’s menu?\n\nPépin:  Well, certainly we change it by putting everything fresh, like even the clam chowder.  They were doing a clam chowder, a New England clam chowder, but you know dehydrated onion, did that, too.  We put three hundred pound of fresh onion.  We did, you know, fresh butter, took the margarine out, everything with butter, flour to do our roux.  Beef burgundy.  We did the fried clam as well.  You know, many of those things was just to improve.  We did stock, three thousand pound of beef bones at a time, and we did our own stock, and, in fact, what we did, we strained the stock, which we would then reduce and use in soup or whatever we were doing.\nBut in France, when I work at the Plaza Athénée, the chef saucier used to make the glace de viande, and the glace de viande, is a second boiling when you finish cooking your bone for twelve, fifteen hours, sometime more, you fill it with water and we cook that for twelve, fourteen hours more.  By the time the bone are starting to disintegrate, then you strain it through a very fine strainer and you reduce that until it is thick like glue, you know.  And that’s what really a glace de viande. When you buy BV is done with vegetable protein or whatever, but the real glace de viande is this, which we did at the Plaza Athénée, and we kept some for us.  But you always had too much, and the chef saucier had the right to sell it to some caterer, but when you do a veal shank, for example, and you did with a little bit of cognac, white wine, and you put a bit of cream, well, you put a tablespoon of that glace de viande in it and thicken, and an enormous amount of taste.  So there I used to do glace de viande with the three thousand pound of veal bone, and out of that I get three can, number ten can, of glace de viande, which I sold to a guy called Maison de Glass on 59th Street and Park Avenue there.\n\nQ:  During the time that you were at Howard Johnson’s, were you meeting the French chefs in America?  I was a little bit confused about when you met Helen McCully.\n\nPépin:  Yes, it was very easy.  I met Helen McCully when I was still at the Pavillon, because Craig Claiborne, who just started at the New York Time, came to do a piece on Pierre Franey and the Pavillon, and met me.  I became very friend with Craig.  Where I live on 50th Street, he live on 53rd and First Avenue, and Craig introduced me to Helen who lived on 52nd St.  Helen was a very feisty woman from Nova Scotia, who had never been married, never have children, and she always take people under their wings.  So I became her surrogate son, if you want, and so I then went every week to cook for her in her apartment.  She was one block from me to come back, and she said, “You have to start writing.”  She pushed me to go Columbia and stuff like this.\nAnd Helen spoke with James Beard on the telephone like two hours every day, about whatever was going on in the food world.  Jim Beard was not very well known at the time.  Helen was much more known than Julia.  Well, Julia was not known at all.  She had never written a book.  She had never done television or books.  So Helen introduced me to James Beard a few weeks later.\n\nQ:  By going to his house or by—\n\nPépin:  I forget.  I think he came to her house.\n\nQ:  To her apartment?\n\nPépin:  Yes.  I didn’t know James Beard anyway.  James Beard was not very pretentious, so he talk about, you know, being in France and the place that he ate in France, and what he was doing.  So that was great.  I mean, James Beard was a very gentle giant.\nAnd then in the spring, a few months later, Helen showed me a manuscript.  She said, “I have the manuscript of that book.  You want to take a look at it?” which was Julia’s Mastering the Art of French Cooking.  She said, “The woman is coming next week.  Let’s cook for her.”  She said, “It’s a big woman with a terrible voice.”  And that was Julia, to whom I spoke in French, I guess, because her French was better than my English.  So, I mean, I knew kind of the trinity of cooking, you know, James Beard, Craig, and Julia, like six months after I was here.  So the food world was really very small, very small at that time compared to what it is now, you know.\n\nQ:  And you kept in touch with those people all the time at Howard Johnson’s.  Did you meet more people through Craig Claiborne?\n\nPépin:  Yes, through Craig a lot, because, I mean, my wedding was at Craig Claiborne.  He did my wedding there.  We all cooked there.  I used to spend almost all my weekend there.  When I was in New York, I saw Helen, she’d start making me write for House Beautiful, so I started doing, and I saw James Beard very often because of that, either at his place or with Helen or going out for dinner or one of those things.  There was not that many like IACP or the Beard House now, where people of the food world would meet.  It didn’t really exist.  American Wine and Food didn’t exist.  Nothing of those things existed really.\nBut I met James Beard, and I say very often, I became friends with him.  And then when people wanted me to give some classes, I called him and I said, “Can I use your kitchen?” he say, “Absolutely,” and he was always broke anyway.  So always wanted to make some money.  And at that time he lived not in the house that he is now, it was—this is 12th Street now, right?  And the other one was close.  It was next to the women’s jail there in the back.\n\nQ:  Women’s House of Detention, yes.\n\nPépin:  Yes.  I forget exactly the address.  So I gave classes there, and he had that spiral staircase also, which went from the kitchen, and he used to come down anyway and be with us, sit down with us and talk to the people.  You couldn’t keep him away from the kitchen.  And then I had other people like—\n\nQ:  Let me ask you about that.  I’m a little confused.  He paid you?  You paid him?\n\nPépin:  No, I paid him.\n\nQ:  You paid him to teach there?\n\nPépin:  I paid him to use the kitchen.\nAt this time it was Gino was upstairs, and Felipe Rojas-Lombardi, I think was already his friend there.  But, yes, he was very friend with me.  Then we met in Napa after I was doing stuff, when I stopped cooking later on, doing classes, that was later.  So we did stuff together at the Stanford Court, you know, with Jim Nassikas, and the dinner, we were invited all the time there for one thing or another.  So I used to see him a lot there also.  He was very simple to be with because he was always happy, laughing.  What was amazing with him was probably his recollection of food, much more than mine, which I never remember anything.  So he would tell me that he ate in France.\nHe ate actually with Curnonsky, he told me.  Curnonsky was the prince of gastronomy, and he lived actually across from La Pepinière, the caserne where I was when I was in the navy, and he killed himself throwing himself out of the window.  He was pretty old already at the time, but apparently in 1926 in front of a jury he was able to differentiate sixteen type of champagne, tell you what they were and all that.  And he’s the one who created La France Gourmande and the precursor to the Michelin traveling.\nHe was elected prince of Gastronomy by three thousand chef or whatever at the time.  He was a big, big deal.  Actually, his name was Edmond Sailland, as you probably know that, S-a-i-l-l-a-n-d.  At the time, after the First World War, a lot of Russian, white Russian refugee were in Paris, and it was very fashionable to have a Russian name.  Everyone was a Russian, the Russian name, and Curnonsky was a ghost writer for Willy, the husband of Colette, you know.  So he decided to take a name, and he took, from the Latin, Cur non sky [phonetic], “why not ski,” you know.  Curnonsky is a pen name that he took.\nBut James Beard would tell me that he ate with Curnonsky, you know, so in the thirties or forties or whatever.  I remember another dinner he discussed a lot, one of the first three-star, it was a big Dumaine also.  So he would have that memory of those dishes and the wine and all that that he had, which was kind of amazing, because I never remember those things, for me.  So that’s what impressed me a lot.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  This is the second continuation of my interview with Jacques Pépin.\n\nPépin:  James Beard was a big eater, you know, and Helen always do those tiny portions.  They love it.  They ate everything.  Well, she did those minute things, you know.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Why did she make tiny portions?\n\nPépin:  Because she was a very tiny woman and she ate very daintily.  She was very good this way.  So I remember one time I went with James Beard, she did quail.  We had one quail per person.  I forget what I cooked before, but James Beard took his quail, he kind of bit it and he swallow it whole.  We came out with Gloria to the elevator, he said, “Let’s go eat somewhere.”  [laughter]\n\nQ:  You said that she encouraged you to write.  This would have been in English, yes?\n\nPépin:  Absolutely, yes.\n\nQ: And did that daunt you at all?\n\nPépin:  No.  Well, I was starting at Columbia, and as I said, talking about food, that’s what I would be doing, and which is actually what I did, and it was very simple little article about food and wine, and after she asked me what I wanted to do.  I say, “You know, people don’t really know anything about technique here.”  So I start in technique in House Beautiful.  Those were black and white picture of the size of stamp.  You couldn’t even see what it was.  And I did a series of those, which I don’t know what happened to it because I’ve lost them, but that was the genesis certainly of La Technique for me after I realized I would do that book in larger.\n\nQ:  Now, this may seem naïve, but how did you realize that people knew nothing about technique?\n\nPépin:  Because working with people, they didn’t really know how to hold a knife or the boning out of a chicken or the doing of which step that I find relatively simple.  People didn’t have that type of training which is very French.\n\nQ: Even at Pavillon?\n\nPépin:  Well, even at the Pavillon, many of them at the Pavillon, except for Pierre Franey and maybe another one or two, all the other one had been trained in America.  And so I thought that would be important, and I didn’t really see any book on that.  I didn’t really have much book at that time.  I started in cookbook when I worked for Howard Johnson, because at that time I never had book in France, really, and I start learning more about Escoffier or any of those people at that point.  The whole part of cooking which has to do with history and all that for me was totally unknown, like it is for most chef working.  We understood in French, not really concern yourself with this.\n\tSo I thought La Technique would be, yes, would be something to do, and I start going into that direction.  But my wife told me, I said, “Don’t peel a carrot this way.  A carrot you peel this way,” simple stuff, or an asparagus or whatever it is.  So we get into very basic technique, but the more I did, and when I start writing that book, I was at Craig, actually, and I met Herb Nagourney, who was the president of Times Book, and he was on the board of the Time, actually, of the New York Times, and with his friend that he live with for many, many years, before they get married, I end up doing the wedding with Claude.  It was Ann Bramson, who is the president of Artisan Book now, and she was doing something with Craig as an editor.  I became friend with her, but he said, “Do you want to do a book?”\n\tAnd I said, “Yes, I’d love to.  I mean, I’ve done [unclear].  I would like to do a book.”\n\tHe said, “Great, fine.  Come see me.”  That was done.  I never had an agent.  I never had an agent until a couple of years ago.  I never had an agent before I did The Apprentice, and they told me, “Oh, you have to an agent for that type of book.  It’s prose.”  I don’t really see the point now, but fine.  But I never had an agent before.  So I went, and he said, “Well, what do you think you’re going to do?”\n\tI said, “Well, probably about four hundred picture.  I want to show the technique, explain this.”\n\tHe said, “Okay.  Go ahead.”\n\nQ:  This would have been for Ann Bramson or for—\n\nPépin:  For Time Book.  Ann was going to edit it, and at some point, you know, he call and I said, “You know, I think I need like eight hundred picture.”\n\tHe said, “Go ahead,” and he call again.\n\tAnd I said, “Well, you know, I think twelve hundred picture should do it.”\n\tHe said, “Okay.  Go ahead,” and at some point Craig and I said, “I think I need fifteen hundred pictures.”\n\tSo at that point he said, “That’s it.”  So I did about fifteen  hundred picture in La Technique, and I did La Methode, which was close to another fifteen hundred picture, which I wanted to call La Technique Number Two, but they said, “No, no.  It doesn’t sell.”  After we find a synonym, but it’s a continuation of it, which now is in one book anyway.  I have the book of La Technique here, the whole—somewhere, I hope.  Maybe I have it downstairs, which is a big book now, which had been redone not that long ago.  I re-edited to put all the stuff together, maybe five, six, seven years ago.  So it’s been in print since ’75, something like that.\n\nQ:  Those books really are quite extraordinary, and I have been told by a number of chefs who went into the field before cooking schools, that they learned to cook by reading those books.\n\nPépin:  Certainly Tom Colicchio say that all the time.\n\nQ:  He definitely says that, yes.\n\nPépin:  So very compliment.  He said, “I never been to a cooking school.  I start with those book and went through.”  So that was very gratifying to me, certainly, you know.  But, you know, it started probably in the sixteenth century during La Varenne in France, where actually the food started to be codified, and written down during the time of Louis XIV, I suppose, because of the stability of the country, the opening of road and all that, it was conducive to marketing and traveling and, you know, distribution of food and all that.  So food started to evolve at that point, where there was a consensus, and that’s what’s important, that is, that if you cut a vegetable like that, you call it a brunoise.  This way it’s a julienne.  So there is a body of work of technique that at least everyone adhered to.  I don’t think it exist this way in Italy, although the cooking can be better than French cooking, the point is not there.  The point is that if one does his own thing, it’s more individualistic in that way.\n\tNow, in France at least, and still now we all adhere to that, and that’s why people enroll at the French Culinary Institute, whether they’re going to move into Spanish or—not Chinese, no.  But any kind of western cookery, the type of apprenticeship of western cookery-- beating an egg white the right way or poaching an egg or doing that, it’s the right way to learn.  You do other thing.  I mean, Bobby Flay or those guy who graduate from here are not doing French cooking, you know.  But that being said, of course, if you have no talent, you still had the label of craftsmanship, you don’t go away, but if you happen to have talent and have that knowledge in your hand, then you can take it somewhere, you know.\n\nQ:  Did you have any sense of how important those books were going to be?\n\nPépin:  Well, not really, not really.  No, I didn’t really think in those term.  I just saw that there was no book done this way, and I thought it would be good to do that.  I mean, no book that I knew, and I was lucky because at that time it was not easy to do a cookbook.  I would offer to, but publisher didn’t do that many cookbook.  I don’t know of many cookbook came every year, but maybe twenty, twenty-five, whatever.  Now there were three thousand last year, cookbook.\n\tSo at least when your book came out, people looked at it, because it was not that many book on the market.  Now it’s such an extreme number that you never even—I mean, I receive over a hundred manuscript a year to give a quote or whatever.  I don’t have time to read those things, you know.  And some very good book are unnoticed now because of this, because it’s too many coming out.  But at that time I was lucky enough, as I said before, people would look at it.\n\nQ:  And at this point, were you not Jacques Pépin, books that size would never be published.  It would be much too expensive to—\n\nPépin:  It was, yes, actually, and, in fact, when La Technique came out, there was a big block or color pictures in the middle, and I did the same thing with La Methode, and they did it, and then they did a reprint that took the color picture out.  They didn’t even take the reference to it.  So very often I finish a dish, and I say, “Look color picture,” I don’t need to do an extra picture there.  You can see the finished dish there.  But then they took it out without even removing the reference, you know.  And then after it came in paperback, and then it came in this, and then it came in this.\nAnd I did a book prior to that, called A French Chef Cooks at Home with Simon & Schuster, and they did a contract for me where I had to give them the next book, they had option to everything, which now after I learn how to write contract, I never sign another contract like this.  But when I did La Technique that Herb Nagourney asked me to do, I said, “I have to propose it to them,” he said, “Don’t worry about it.”\nI propose it to them, they refuse it.  I said, “Great. Can you send me a letter of refusal?”\n\tAnd they say, “No, we need more to know about it.  Send us—,” and they jerk me around like that for over six months having to send more stuff before they actually officially refused it.\nWell, after that, it was finished, they brought the paperback edition, you know.  But it was sold and resold to the point that I never made any money with it, in twenty, thirty years.\n\nQ:  That’s extraordinary.\n\nPépin:  Very little.  Almost nothing at all.  And then now I made a little bit of money with that big reprinted edition that they are doing now.\n\nQ:  This was all obviously after you left Howard Johnson’s and at a different point in your life.\n\nPépin:  Yes, it was after Howard Johnson’s, yes.  Although I may have started working on A French Chef Cooks at Home when I was still at Howard Johnson, I think.\n\n[End of session]\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is November 10, 2009, and this is the second session of my interview with Jacques Pépin.\n\tI was wondering was there ever a time when you consciously made a decision to stay in the United States.\n\nPépin:  Well, it’s a very insidious thing.  You know, you go somewhere and certainly at the beginning that I was here you think, “Oh, that was better in France.  This is better in France,” you think of those details and all that, and you think even that you would want to go back, and when you go back, you find a lot of thing that you don’t like there.  You say, “Gee,” you know, and so those thing grows on you.\n\tI remember all the time the first few time I went back to France I bought more suit there and shirt, I thought it was better, and now I would do the opposite.  I won’t buy there; I will buy here.  Likewise, I would go to the doctor.  I think the doctor, I don’t know, for some reason I was used to, and now I would do the opposite, I’m used to.  So, you know, to a certain extent whoever you are, wherever you are, you get brainwashed to a certain extent to the kind of culture and condition of one country, you know.  Whether you think you are or not, it’s immaterial, but we are.  I mean, you know, when I came from France I knew that the French soldier—I don’t know, the parachutist or what would you call the one in the desert, the legionnaire and all that are the greatest soldier, and you will ask an American, say, “What do you mean the greatest soldier in the world?  But it’s the American marine, of course.”  You’re born to learn this, and whether it’s true or not, maybe the German or the Colombian or whoever, who knows.  But certainly you build up, in any country that I go to, to think that your culture is the best, is the greatest, and so forth.  So there is a fair amount of brainwashing whether you realize it or not.\nEven people on television who do that, and they’re not realize it themselves.  I mean, look at the Olympic.  You know, when I go to France, I look at the Olympic in France, which was the case the last time I went there.  It was like another Olympic.  You know, same people doing fencing or doing all kind of sport that I have never seen here, and vice versa.  Winter Olympic the same way, you know.  You learn that the first one in the downhill race is an Austrian such, and the first American is number twelve.  Who is second and third?\n\nQ:  Are you an American citizen?\n\nPépin:  Oh, yes.  I’ve been an American citizen for, well, forty-five years.  I’ve been here fifty years.  Yes, I was an American citizen before I got married, and that was ’66.  My wife is a French citizen, as well.  We have both passports.\n\nQ:  Was that a difficult decision, to become a citizen?\n\nPépin:  Oh, no, no, no.  No, no, I liked it here.  I felt that I’m here.  I made a commitment.  No, I wanted to become an American citizen.\n\nQ:  Have you ever thought in terms of what kind of contribution you could make, that you might be able to make a greater contribution here?\n\nPépin:  I don’t really think in term of contribution.  I rarely think of the past.  I mean, I talk about, you know, when I was with the French president or other thing, and it’s so far for me now, it’s all lost like it never existed.  That’s why maybe because my memory is not that good, maybe because I am that type of character and my mother is too.  I always think now and in the future.  I’m working on that idea too.  And when things are over, I kind of disregard it, and that’s all, you know.  So I don’t know whether it’s good or bad, but that’s the way it is.\n\nQ:  Was that pretty much your attitude after the accident, that is was now and future?\n\nPépin:  Yes, I just have to forget about it and move forward, and do whatever I could do.  Yes.\n\nQ:  You mentioned that the culinary schools were starting to grow around the time after the accident.\n\nPépin:  Well, cooking schools, more cooking school attached to a cookware shop and all that, a thing what doesn’t really exist in Europe or in France.  So by the time I went in one place to do a cooking demonstration, and they sell equipment too, and they ask me, “Can you come next year for a week or maybe five class or ten?”  And I end up going, I would stay, six, seven weeks, yes, on the West Coast only, two or three weeks in San Francisco, maybe week or two in L.A., then I move to Eureka or one place or another.  Come back, teach in Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia, Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine.  I mean, it was amazing during the seventies, and I made a very good living on that.\n\nQ:  Probably more than you would have made as a—\n\nPépin:  Cooking in the kitchen.  Well, maybe yes, maybe no, but certainly I had more control of what I was doing, and I work when I went there, but I could have two, three weeks in between or do what I wanted, you know.\n\nQ:  And you got to know the ingredients all over the country?\n\nPépin:  I got to know America all over the country, and the ingredient.  I think I know America more than most American that I know, including my wife.  You know, from Des Moines, Iowa to Davenport, to Moline, to a small town here.\n\nQ:  At what point did this school enter your life, starting the school enter your life?\n\nPépin:  Here?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nPépin:  At the French Culinary Institute I started in 1989, and so it’s twenty years, just a bit above twenty years.\n\nQ:  Had she started the school yet or—\n\nPépin:  The school was like three years old, and there was a young man was having lunch today, but he’s not young anymore, with his wife, Christian Fournet, from the hotel school of Paris, who came to set up the school and start it.  And then after a contract was finished with Dorothy, she wanted someone which was more American but still in the knowledge a lot about French cooking and already a bit of a name.  So that’s why she called me.\n\nQ:  And why did it appeal to you?\n\nPépin:  Well, I always like to teach, whether I taught skiing or literature or cooking.  Cooking is what I know the best.  So that’s what I’m the best at, and so whether it’s at B.U., I always get a shot in the arm, you know, teaching the student and all that.  I still consider what I do on television teaching, you know.\n\nQ:  Absolutely.  Do you have anything on television in the works right now?\n\nPépin:  Yes, I have—well, I did two series called “Fast Food My Way,” and “More Fast Food My Way,” where I actually use the supermarket à la prep cook.  Just like when you work in a professional kitchen, someone come to bone out the chicken, bone the fish, slice the mushroom, chop the shallot, wash the spinach, I can get that in the supermarket now, à la prep cook with a minimal amount of effort. I can make very good fresh food with minimal effort and time.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nPépin:  So that was the idea behind that series, which is [uncler] La Technique, you know.  Or maybe the best book of all that I’ve done is The Art of Cooking, which I did in the eighties.  I did two volumes, for which I did 34,000 picture, and I had two volumes in color, recipe and technique.  This is what sold the least of anything that I have done, and I still think probably the best.\n\nQ:  And you’re talking about which?\n\nPépin:  I wrote a book called The Art of Cooking, volume one and two.  I went fishing in my pond to get a frog to show you how to skin out a frog, or in Long Island to get skate, to show you how to take the wing out of skate.  I have a whole baby lamb.  So everything is started from the beginning, and I think it was good, but, as I say, it didn’t sell.\n\nQ:  I couldn’t find that at the 42nd Street Library, actually, because I’ve looked recently.  Why do you think it was the best?\n\nPépin:  Well, because it was the most thought out, elaborated.  It was in the style of La Technique, but it bring together the cooking of interesting recipe with the technique, you know.  I think I have it here, at least in paperback.\n\nQ:  Was it not promoted in the same way?  Oh, I see what you mean.\n\nPépin:  It was like La Technique, but it’s totally in color.  Well, I don’t know promotion or it wasn’t the time, or you don’t know.  In fact, I had all kind of article on it.  An article very glowing, very fantastic, but kind of negative in the sense that it said if you want to bone out a whole baby lamb, then take that book, which, of course, a lot of people said, “Oh, my god.  I’m never going to do this,” or whatever, when, in fact, you don’t have to do it.  You can start at picture twenty-two, when it’s all bone out and start—and all the recipe are basically like this, you know.  I mention that, or a rabbit.  Here I take the fur out of the rabbit, and show, but, you know, people maybe get scared.  This is what I do in the technique.  If I do a steak, I do the whole loin, you know, to show you how to clean it up.  Most people are not going to do that.  They’re going to start when the steak is cut, and buy it.  But, you know, that’s the way it was.\n\nQ:  At the time that you wrote that, were you already writing the columns for the New York Times?\n\nPépin:  Yes, I think I was.  Yes, I think so.\n\nQ:  What made you want to do those columns?\n\nPépin:  See here I have that thing start at the beginning..\n\nQ:  Oh, look at that.  Wow.\n\nPépin:  So by the time you break it down into all this, you’ll end up here with the stuffing.  So you can say start at picture twenty-two, buy a leg of baby lamb and do the recipe or whatever, with artichokes or whatever I did there.\nThe New York Times.  Well, New York Times is very prestigious.  I had done article in the New York Times from the late sixties, with Craig Claiborne often, and Pierre sometime.  And after Pierre had his own 60 Minute Gourmet, but I did a thing for the Sunday Times.  In fact, the picture that I have behind La Technique, the first Technique, and I did that in ’74, it’s a picture of the New York Times of an article that I did for the Sunday Times at that time.  So in the seventy I was doing article occasionally if they ask me, and that was fine.  And at that point they asked me to do a column, which was called “The Purposeful Cook,” which was geared toward people—economy in the kitchen, you know.\n\tSo, as I said before, I have twenty-some book idea.  I did a book for the Cleveland Clinic for cardiac patient.  Well, that very focus I did those column in the New York Times were economy in the kitchen, they were very focused toward this.  La Technique and La Methode illustrated many of cooking technique, and that goes from the beginning, and then Fast Food My Way is geared toward another area of food.  So, often for a chef it’s a question of focusing your knowledge of food toward one specific area, and because people say that the way you cook now, Fast Food My Way, no, not necessarily, but that’s the way I always cooked, as well.  There was always moment where you cooked the whole weekend, spend ten hours a day in the kitchen, and then come Tuesday you go shopping and come home.  You’re in a hurry.  You get a can of this, do something, so it was for me a question of extrapolating those recipe when I do that to do a book in a series just for this.\n\nQ:  How did the Cleveland Clinic book come about?\n\nPépin:  A friend of mine, Susie Heller, live in Cleveland, asked me, and I did some recipe.  I had done recipe already demonstration for diabetes and for different other challenge, or cook without fat or this, that, too.\n\nQ:  You had done those for what?\n\nPépin:  I had done that for one article or another, and so they asked me—she knew some people there at that time.  It was Bernadine Healy who was the head of the cardiac department.  And so I did two or three little booklet of a recipe on all that, which now was—when it went out of print, Rodale took it, and it’s a book that Rodale calls Simple and Healthy Cooking.  It’s still there.  Most of the account of the nutritional profile, which we did in some book at some point, was big.  Now people don’t care.  The nutritional profile in those books that I did at the Cleveland Clinic is wrong, like most book in there.\n\nQ:  Because?\n\nPépin:  And it’s wrong because they take the list and amount of ingredients, put it to a computer, and come out with something which is totally wrong.  Because I start with a chicken, it’s 3,000 calorie in that chicken.  Fine, but if you read the first two paragraph, I bone it out, take the skin out, take this out, by then—so you look the recipe next page, where I said buy four skinless, boneless breast of chicken, you have a recipe with not even a third of the calorie, when, in fact, the two are the same, but they don’t figure the technique too, or look that you cook chicken on the skin and you have three tablespoon of fat, you throw it out and you continue.  Or that you have a glass of wine, which is 150 calorie for five ounce or whatever.  By the time you cook it, burn it, the alcohol evaporate and you are left with some maybe 30 calories or so of residual sugar or whatever.  So to do it well, which I wanted to, but no one wanted to do it, was to do each recipe, do it in a package, put in a machine to make a paste out of it, send it to a lab so they calculate each recipe, to know exactly the calorie count.  But that, of course—\n\nQ:  Very expensive.\n\nPépin:  And time.  Twenty time more expensive than just going through a—anyway.\n\nQ:  Which of the books or the series have you gotten the most response from, from the public?\n\nPépin:  Maybe this one, Fast Food My Way.  I don’t know now whether it’s because I’m known more after all those years, that may be a reason too, but it seemed more attainable and easier for people.  So in a sense more this way, but the first three series that I did were really good, I think.  It was called Today’s Gourmet.  I did three little book which eventually I did a large book called Jacques Pépin’s Table.  This is what, when people ask me, “How many book you have?” I never know exactly, because I did three book for those three series, and we did a large book with it, so now I don’t know whether I have four book or one book.\n\nQ:  I was going to ask you, because you know, of course, as time goes on you write more, but it’s impossible to get a correct—\n\nPépin:  Count.\n\nQ:  Yes.  What do you say these days?\n\nPépin:  I say I wrote about twenty, twenty-five book, because, as I said, those three book of Today’s Gourmet individually.  For example, I have those two book of Fast Food My Way, and I will probably do another series of that.  At some point I’ll probably put it together.\n\nQ:  In one book.\n\nPépin:  So now I don’t know whether it going to be called as one book or four book, you know.\n\nQ:  But the television series you can count, yes?\n\nPépin:  I count all of those books.  Most of the book that I have done are for television series.\n\nQ:  No, what I mean is, but it is possible to count the number of television series you have done.\n\nPépin:  Oh, yes, of course, yes.\n\nQ:  And at this point, do you know what that number is?\n\nPépin:  Well, I have done eleven series of twenty-six show, and then I’ve done many other show.  There is “Good Morning, America,” this, that, too.  Or appearance with Sara Moulton or Emeril Lagasse, and I don’t know, many of those.  Yes, a bunch.\n\nQ:  How did you decide what recipes to put in Fast Food My Way?  Did you have a number of minutes or—\n\nPépin:  I take idea year ‘round, all the time.  I have yellow pad full of ideas, say, “That be interesting to do it this way too.”  And then when I start doing recipe, I mean, I don’t have a big office.  I have myself and that’s it, basically.  I mean, Norma is there to type recipe, and my wife doesn’t really get involved into this, so I take idea.  Like last week I did five or six recipe.  I say, “What are we going to have for dinner?”  I say, “I have a piece of fish.”  I wanted to do that.  So, fine.  Then I had dinner at some friend, I say I wanted to do a chocolate soufflé, just with the white with a ganache, which I did.  But I said, well, I have four yolk with it.  Let me do a sabayon with marsala and all that, which I did another recipe for dessert in the next series, and I’m looking for twenty-six dessert and twenty-six main course and first course and so forth.\n\tSo I do that, give it to Norma.  She types it.  I look at it, do an introduction, change a bit of things.  She retypes it, and basically I have the recipe.  Often a lot of chefs work in a different way, because there is an organization.  A guy like Daniel Boulud or Charlie Trotter or whatever, they have a whole team.  They have a test kitchen, and people are doing recipe.  I don’t have that.  I am alone at home.  I write it on a yellow pad.\n\nQ:  But you’re very orderly about it.\n\nPépin:  Yes.  I don’t say that this is better what I do or what they do, but certainly me a reflect the point of view of one person certainly more realistic in that sense than the point of view of Per Se, which is a restaurant.  I think they do it—even though it is cooking of Thomas Keller certainly and his idea and his philosophy and all that, and there is the writer for the books, and there is this, and then there is that, and they try a recipe and so forth.  I don’t do that, which I do it at home this way.  I’ve always done it this way.\n\nQ:  I didn’t know until I started looking at your books that you did drawings as well.\n\nPépin:  Yes, yes, I do a lot of drawing and painting and stuff.\n\nQ:  Does it give you pleasure or—\n\nPépin:  Yes.  I even have painting in the museum.\n\nQ:  Yes?\n\nPépin:  In the Britain Art Museum.\n\nQ:  What is the painting?\n\nPépin:  The New Britain Art Museum.  Well, the painting that I have there is the painting—I think I have it in that book.  That book has a lot of my painting.  That book is a continuation of La Technique, if you want, because in that book I have an essay, I have five or six essays.  An essay on painting and cooking, an essay on—\n\nQ:  Yes, the library didn’t have that either.\n\nPépin:  The making of a recipe.  So that’s interesting.  See, that would be one of my painting.  And certainly there is a whole style of painting.  See, this one was sold for $8,500 for a charity for the museum, in fact.\n\nQ:  How do you make time for painting?\n\nPépin:  Well, those are old painting, you know.  This is a very personal book, as I said, this one with the recipe very arbitrarily chosen out of hundred recipe that are dear to me from [unclear] and all that, without any other, my aunt.  A little fish we pick up on the net in the summer, you know.  This is a beach of Connecticut, a thing that my wife does too.  I have picture of picnic with my friend Jean-Claude here, on the river.  My wife, this is my mother and me cooking together a long time ago in California somewhere.  This is my mother when she came on Le France with my aunt, who has a restaurant in Lyon as well.\n\nQ:  Your mother seems like a very extraordinary person.\n\nPépin:  Yes.  This is my daughter when she was three years old cooking, and that’s her daughter when she was three years old cooking, a couple of years ago.  From the daughter to granddaughter.\n\nQ:  Were both of your parents as energetic as you are?\n\nPépin:  Oh, yes, oh yes, especially my mother more.  My mother is dynamite.  I mean, she even at ninety-five now, she still do her own cooking and stuff.\nThe mushroom we got in Connecticut, that’s one thing that I do, a lot of mushroom, so I have about twenty type of mushroom here.\n\nQ:  What kind of a role do you have in this school?\n\nPépin:  This is the painting.\n\nQ:  Oh, I see.  Oh, my goodness.\n\nPépin:  I choose that one, but it’s more abstract.\n\nQ:  Yes, it’s very Picassoesque.\n\nPépin:  I am dean of special program and I give classes.  I mean, I have a class tomorrow, which I have to go in this afternoon to prepare, because tonight I have to leave to do a dinner at the yacht club.  So a couple of class.  I talk to a fair amount of student, and, you know, I meet a lot of people out here and talk, and the general direction of the school certainly at the beginning, the recipe and all that too.  School is divided into 250 competencies.  That is, we have to cover the eggs, poach, boiled, fried, whatever, and so this is the bulk of thing that I’ve worked on and so forth.\n\nQ:  To your knowledge, is there more of an emphasis on technique here than in other places?\n\nPépin:  I would think so.  I would think so, because, I mean, this is how I define French cooking, you know, as basically a kind of technique that everyone adhere to or agree to, to extol the product the best possible way, you know.  And that being said, if you only live at that level, well, you are a craftsman, but if you have happen to have talent, now you have a knowledge in your hand that you can take that talent somewhere and do something with, like someone like Thomas Keller or Jean Georges or whatever.\n\nQ:  Do you get a chance to see much talent in the students here?\n\nPépin:  Yes and no.  At the end, yes, because at the beginning you see the character of the person very easily at the beginning.  That guy is going to be a good worker or whatever, and he’s there on time and attentive and stuff like that, that takes no time.  One, two days, you know.  The talent itself, I told them, “You are not here to experiment and all that.  This is not really the time.”  You have to absorb as much as you can, and work with another chef, and just say, “Yes, chef,” and absorb, whether you agree or not.  Then go with another one, and with another one, and after eight, ten years of that, if you work at good place you will absorb an enormous amount of material, and then you will start regurgitating, if you want what you have learned.  But through your sense of aesthetic and your sense of taste, and at that point it kind of become your own cooking.  Because at some point you can escape yourself, you’re going to be who you are and you get to the greatest restaurant.  Things at the top are different because you have two different personality and there is no way that you cannot, I say, escape yourself.\n\nQ:  Do you find students a little bit impatient about—\n\nPépin:  Well, certainly, but this is America, the county of instant gratification.  People want to not to spend a year, the year that we spend in the kitchen.  They want to learn, and we do.  Amazingly, I’m amazed at what people can do in six months at the program we have here, which is the program of the École Hôtelière of Paris, which is two years’ program which we massaged to six months, you know, and it’s an amazing thing.  But, of course, we have doctor, lawyer, accountant here, I mean people are between twenty-five and sixty years old, and all usually second career and they pay themselves.  They are very attentive.  It’s certainly expensive.  So it’s a different way of learning.  We cater to them, we show, we explain, we show.  As opposed to the way I learn, where no one whatever said anything, and you would kind of steal it rather than—so it’s another way of learning.\n\nQ:  What about at B.U.?  What do you teach there and how often?\n\nPépin:  Well, we have a group of fifteen people which certainly began in the culinary world, in the culinary art.  Then there was a school of hospitality.  I haven’t this year actually given classes, but the kids get a B.A. in hotel management.  There I was giving a class on international cuisine, and then we are offering a B.A., an M.S., a master of art in art in gastronomy—in liberal arts, rather, with a concentration in gastronomy.  So there I was teaching a class on the history of French cooking in the context of civilization, literature, starting with the Pléiade poets of the 16th century.  There is an apology of field salad in Ronsard as a point of departure up to the little Madeleine of Proust, talking, and through, of course, great gourmands of nineteenth century, from Alexander Dumas to Balzac or others.  So, you know, that was that type of class, and basically this was my doctoral dissertation at B.U., at Columbia.\n\nQ:  Could you tell me why you and Julie Child thought it would be a good idea to establish a program in Boston?\n\nPépin:  Well, question of respect, you know.  I mean, the food world is part of a menial world, and food has never been really studied, and still now—I mean, when I went to B.U. teaching at B.U., they told me that I could get a Ph.D. if I wanted there, if I want to write that thesis.  I still have had to filter it through the Department of Anthropology or History or, you know, basically almost any kind of liberal science.  But it has to be filtered through something, because food was not as respectful a subject just by itself.  And this is changing.  In addition to the problem there, what I talk to a couple of people, and they said, “Well, we don’t know who is going to check on you, really, and do an evaluation of your work.”\n\nQ:  To challenge you.  [laughs]\n\nPépin:  No.  So anyway, but more and more it’s respected as a bona fide subject and people are writing interesting things.  I think in France as well, now more, but it’s already a bit more academic through that conundrum, maybe, with the French or the paradox that, you know, they’ll consider that haute couture and perfume and cuisine is, you know, it’s, by definition, French, part of your culture and so forth, you know.  But if you want to bring it on academic level, they say, “Oh, are you kidding?”  That’s often the case in academia, you know.\n\nQ:  Would you still like to finish that Ph.D.?\n\nPépin:  No, no.  I have too much stuff to do now, and it was, you know, just personal gratification.\n\nQ:  In terms of the stuff that you do now, you travel constantly, yes?\n\nPépin:  Yes, too much.\n\nQ:  Do you do that to teach?\n\nPépin:  Yes, mostly to teach, whether it’s demonstration for PBS or a fundraising for PBS, I mean, or for one thing or another.  I do get paid occasionally, but I would say maybe one out of ten time.\n\nQ:  That’s amazing.\n\nPépin:  Yes, well, okay, last week I did a thing for Ronald McDonald, you know, the cancer kid, at the Marriott—no.  What hotel in New Haven?  I did a thing for the River Museum, and I had a dinner, two dinner, actually, that I had to do with my wife, come to the dinner, which are won by someone who pay so much to have dinner with me sometime or whatever.  A week before I did, I think for the Land Trust of Connecticut, and get the chairman to save a farm so it will never not be a farm.  River Museum, you know, AIDS, Cystic Fibrosis, battered woman, this, that, too, everything seems to be filtered through food.  If you ask a cardiologist to come and talk about your heart problem, and ask people to pay $200, they probably won’t come, but if you have fifteen chef coming and wine donated, people will come.\n\nQ:  Do you limit the number of appearances?\n\nPépin:  I try to, you know.  I had five calling me last week or two, or Norma, and I said, “We can’t wait.  It’s a very good cause,” and all that.  They want to put you on the guilt trip.  I say, “I know, I know, I know.”  But, you know, I can’t do it, you know, and maybe year after I’ll do it.  I probably sign seven, eight book a week, every week too, you know, for the library in town, raising money for this, that, too, so we do it.  I mean, I’m not complaining,  I’m doing it because I want, and I’ve gotten a lot out of life and it’s normal to give back, you know.  It should be.  But it’s amazing how much chef are giving.  I mean, chef in any restaurant, they spend their day off oftentime for some type of charity almost every week.\n\nQ:  What is on your calendar now, in terms of things for you, books or TV programs?\n\nPépin:  Well, I’m doing a book with a new series that I will be doing on television next year, and the book is actually an anthology of several books of mine which are out of print, which I have relooked at, changed the recipe, I mean redo an introduction, whatever.  So it will be a pretty large book, like a thousand recipe, and I will do a series on television with that.\n\nQ:  And what will the series be called?\n\nPépin:  I don’t know.  I think the book will get to be called The Essential Pépin.  That’s one word that they have.  But I have, I think, a schedule here, if I have it.  It’s not here.  I don’t know where it is, but I have usually close to a year ahead of—\n\nQ:  Let me ask you something.  You say that your memory isn’t very good, but, in fact, it has to be fabulous to remember as much as you do about the past.  Have you kept notes or diaries or anything?\n\nPépin:  Not really, and my memory really is not very good.  I mean, for example, that project with the guy coming to see me tomorrow.  I still don’t remember after all of that thing.  But you see, for example, okay, I’m at the French Culinary Institute.  This is the last week I don’t have a fresh schedule, but okay—well, that was 2009, starting—well, we go to Mexico, you know, but I’m at B.U., then Lyon, and then a cruise, Pebble Beach.\n\nQ:  Cruises where you teach?\n\nPépin:  Yes, I am executive culinary director of that cruise line.\n\nQ:  Which cruise line is that?\n\nPépin:  Oceania Cruise.  I’ve done two, three cruise this year, then French Culinary Institute, and then I’ve done Food and Wine Classic, and, you know, it goes—and, again, I’m cutting more, and this, of course doesn’t count all of those small fundraising that I do in Connecticut there, for the Fireman Association or whatever, the library or, you know.\n\nQ:  Does Norma keep these schedules from the time that you’ve been associated with her?\n\nPépin:  I don’t know.  Yes, it should be near twenty-four or twenty-five years, something like that.  So for quite a while, yes.  I think at least fifteen years or whatever, I think, she does somewhere.  If we can find them.\n\nQ: Talking about your schedule, I want to thank you for making time for this.\n\nPépin:  You’re welcome.\n\nQ:  I very much appreciate it.\n\nPépin:  Good.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPAGE  \n\n\nPAGE  1\n\n\n\n\n","description":"Long before cable reality programs brought chefs into American homes, Jacques Pepin was already there, starring in his own multiple cooking series on public television.\r\n\r\nPepin's father was a cabinetmaker and his mother ran a restaurant. When his family sent him out as a restaurant apprentice, their goal was both to feed him and to teach him a trade. He discovered a passion for the work and his talent soon propelled him from the provinces, to the kitchens of French presidents, to one of New York's best restaurants. When a serious automobile accident made long hours in a restaurant impossible, he turned to teaching and then television.\r\n\r\nAlong the way he became a husband and father, an American citizen, a bestselling writer, and one of the guiding spirits of both the prestigious French Culinary Institute in Manhattan and the culinary program at Boston University.\r\n\r\nIncluded among his more than 20 books are arguably two of the most influential on cooking techniques ever written in this country, La Technique and La Methode.

She became the food editor of New York Newsday, which closed in 1995, and now teaches food writing at New York University, while maintaining an active career as a freelance food writer and occasional restaurant critic.\r\n\r\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Irene Sax\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t        New York City\n\nDate:  April 29, 2009\n\nQ:  It’s April 29, 2009.  This is Judith Weinraub.  I’m with Irene Sax in her apartment.\nGood afternoon.\n\nSax:  Hello.\n\nQ:  You know that much of the purpose of this interview is to discuss the work that you did for and with James Beard.  That said, could you start just by telling me a little bit about when and where you were born and a little bit about your childhood and education?\n\nSax:  Early life.  Yes.  I was born in 1934, in the Catskill Mountains, Monticello.  My grandfather went to the mountains because he had a lung disease, possibly tuberculosis, probably because he was a furrier and had fur in his lungs and it was irritating.  But at any rate, that’s why the family moved there.  When I was a little girl, I lived in what was then pretty much an ordinary country town.\n\nQ:  In the Catskills.\n\nSax:  In the Catskills, Monticello.  My parents were divorced when I was quite young, and I moved with my mother and my stepfather to Queens, New York, when I was about twelve, maybe younger than that, when I was about ten.  After that, I pretty much lived with them, and I went to public high school in Queens and then went to Bryn Mawr College.  Married right after college, which was 1955, as people did then, and had a baby within a year.\nThen for about the next ten years, I was pretty much what they now call a stay-at-home mom.  I was just doing what everybody did, until my younger child went to school or was in nursery school, and I went to Columbia to get a master’s degree, realized I didn’t want to be an academic.  I was there during the riots.  It was a very interesting time to be at Columbia.  At the same time, I started writing, both ghostwriting for people, some of it draft, people who had positions on the draft, some of it psychoanalytic papers for my husband’s colleagues, and some of it general nonfiction writing.  I was beginning to do that when that led to my first job in food.\n\nQ:  Let us establish your bona fides.  Why don’t you just tell me the various jobs you’ve had in food, and then we can go back to Jim Beard.\n\nSax:  The job-jobs I’ve had, as opposed to—I mean, I was hired by Newsday when they opened the New York paper, and I was hired to be, along with Molly O’Neill, I was the New York food writer, she was the New York restaurant reviewer.  I then became the food editor of both Newsday and New York Newsday, and I did that for several years until they closed the New York paper.\n\nQ:  What was 19—\n\nSax:  That was about twelve or thirteen years ago.  That was the early nineties.\n\tAfter that, I went to work for Martha Stewart Living for a while, where I was an editor more than a food editor—I was not in the food department—when the editor there, Susan Wyland, left to work at Disney.com.  She took me with her to be the food editor of that, which was, at the time, the idea was that was going to be an online magazine for young parents.  It was supposed to be like Newsweek, but online and for parents.  That kind of didn’t work out.  I don’t know if it still exists.\n\n[Interrruption]\n\nQ:  I’m back with Irene Sax.  Go ahead.\n\nSax:  So it became clear that that wasn’t going to work out, not because of me, but because of Disney.  I didn’t like the corporate culture.  And I put the word out that I was looking for something else to do, and then Jane Freiman, who had worked for me at Newsday, was at that time features editor of the Daily News, and she asked me if I would like to do their inexpensive restaurant reviews.  Ed Levine was doing it at the moment, and they didn’t get along at all.  I said yes, left, happy to go back to newspapers, and I’ve been doing that for the past ten years, always as a contract writer, not on staff.  That is kind of coming to an end now, really because of what’s happened in newspapers.  They just don’t have the page anymore on which that runs.\n\nQ:  You’re also teaching.\n\nSax:  Yes.  And when I left Newsday, I was just so terrified that I wasn’t going to have any work, and I got as much freelance work as I could, and I have been doing freelance magazine and online articles.  I had a regular gig with Epicurious, where I did a cookbook review a month.  I write for Weight Watchers online because my ex-assistant at Disney is now the food editor there.  I write quite a lot for Saveur because the editor there, Jim Oseland, is someone who I used to take out to lunch with me to Southeast Asian restaurants.  And I teach food writing at NYU in their graduate food studies department.  So I have a lot to do.\n\nQ:  I noticed that you’ve also won some awards along the way.\n\nSax:  Yes, yes.  I was the first person to win a James Beard Internet Award.\n\nQ:  Very early.\n\nSax:  It was the first one they gave, and I think it was for something from Epicurious.  I also write for Food Arts, by the way.  After 9/11, I did a piece for Food Arts about the response of the restaurant community to what was happening downtown, and, first of all, it was the most cathartic piece I’ve ever done, because we were all in shock at that time, and I had something that I knew how to do.  I knew how to report a story.  So for a month, that’s all that I did, was report that story.  And because I’d been around for so long in the food world, I was able to walk into a meeting where Mario Battali and Danny Meyer and the chef at the Waldorf were meeting with members of the Red Cross, and Drew Nieporent, and nobody would even question me, because, “Oh, there’s Irene.”  So I could sit there in the meeting, and I wrote the story.  And then I won the Best of the Year from the American Society of Food Journalists for that.  I’m very proud of that story.\n\nQ:  Let’s go back in time.  Could you tell me how and when and where you met James Beard?\n\nSax:  Yes.  Just a step before that, my first food job was writing The Cooks’ Catalogue.  Barbara Kafka, Milton Glaser, and Burt Wolf, and James Beard, supposedly, although he never had anything to do with it, had a contract to write this book about cooking equipment, and it was really Barbara Kafka’s job.  It was her baby, although I guess Milton designed the book.  Burt, I suppose, put up the money, so everyone [unclear] did it.  I knew Barbara because both of our husbands are psychoanalysts, and I was already working as a writer, freelance, and she brought me in to do the writing.  It’s sort of like what I did with Jim.  I don’t claim that I knew any of this stuff; it was Barbara’s ideas, but I was the writer-writer.  I’ve done a fair amount of ghostwriting back in the olden days.  I did a book for Felipe Rojas-Lombardi.\n\tWhat led to my writing for Jim was that the first Fannie Farmer, then under Judith [Jones], was being done, and it was Marion Cunningham and a woman named Gerry Laybourne.  Gerry was supposed to be the writer.  She was going through a horrible divorce, and also I think her basic interests were in politics.  She worked for an organization called something Watch; I can’t remember now, but they looked at how prisoners were treated in Eastern Europe.  Anyway, Gerry couldn’t do it, and I guess Judith asked around, and Elizabeth Schneider—that is Susie Colchi—suggested me, and I came in and I think maybe one or two people had done a chapter, but once I came in, I did the rest of it.  That meant I was the ghost.\n\nQ:  What would you receive?\n\nSax:  I would receive a chapter of recipes, which were all worked out, and I would edit the recipes, but I would also write head notes and write the introductions to the chapters.  It was a big job.\n\nQ:  She hadn’t done any of that?\n\nSax:  Who?  Marion?  Marion didn’t write at all.  Not at all.  For example, I know that Suzanne Hamlin did a chapter.  I didn’t do 100 percent of that book, but I did enough so that obviously Judith felt that I was reliable.  I don’t know.  That was maybe a year, a year and a half.  Then they tried to do another, International Cooks’ Catalogue, and I worked on that also.  On The Cooks’ Catalogue, it wasn’t just Barbara; it was also—gosh, now I can’t remember her name.  That’s terrible.  I’m blocking.\n\nQ:  You can fill it in.\n\nSax:  Okay.  We’ll have to, yes.  And many other people came into that world at that time.  I met Ray Sokolov then; I met Florence Fabricant.  Many of them did bits and pieces, not of The Cooks’ Catalogue, but of the International Cooks’ Catalogue.\n\nQ:  Was there a place where people were working?\n\nSax:  There was an office for The Cooks’ Catalogue and there was all this equipment there.  Then the International Cooks Catalogue was in a different office.\n\nQ:  When you were working on The Cooks’ Catalogue, did you meet Jim Beard then?\n\nSax:  No, not at all.  Never met him.\n\nQ:  Did you see him?\n\nSax:  No.  I knew that Barbara knew him.  I remember Barbara telling me that she had invited him to dinner and she didn’t have enough fine crystal glasses or something.  At the time I thought, well, why make such a fuss?  And she was right, obviously.  She did cook up a storm for him and served him on fine crystal, and I’m sure that that was a great seduction and that he appreciated it, because he certainly appreciated being made a fuss over.\n\tNo, I met Jim when José Wilson, who did the writing for him—and I only know this by hearsay—had a nervous breakdown, and what I heard was that she went to Portugal to recover, and he needed somebody to write his columns for him or to—that was really an editing matter.  So I would go to his house and pick up a transcript.  He would talk into a machine, and Richard, who was his secretary then, would transcribe it.  I would take it home.  We would chat, but nothing more than that.  I would take it home and I would put it into shape, trying to use as many of his expressions and his vocabulary as possible.  That worked out very well.  I think then José came.  I did that for, as I remember, about six months.  I don’t know.  This would have been in the late seventies, around 1980, something like that.\n\nQ:  These were like monthly articles?\n\nSax:  I think they were more often than that.  I think they were for something like Parade.  He had to keep coming out with them.\n\nQ:  Who made the match between the two of you?\n\nSax:  Judith.  It was because I had done this work for Fannie Farmer that Judith suggested me, and that worked out very well.  I think José came back and then left again.  What I heard—and again, this is just hearsay—is that she adored him, as I’ve heard like Marion Cunningham did.  I know Marion once said that she wished she could have married him, which in a way tells you more about Marion’s needs than his, certainly.\n\nQ:  Could you describe physically the process of receiving these pieces of paper?\n\nSax:  They were typed up by Richard, and it was really a matter of organizing, smoothing out the sentences, trying to make them conversational.  They would sometimes be rambling.  But he would always start with a topic.  I didn’t have to pull anything out.  Sometimes I would call and ask him a question.  But it was really his ideas; he just didn’t get them together.\n\nQ:  Did you have much contact with him during this process?\n\nSax:  Yes, when I would go down and come back, but I didn’t really have a lot of contact with him until I started working on the book.\n\nQ:  What would be Beard on Pasta.\n\nSax:  Beard on Pasta.\n\nQ:  How did that happen?\n\nSax:  Again, that was Judith.  He needed somebody.  Let me just back up a tiny bit.  José, from what I heard, both loved him and was angry that she didn’t get much notice, and she was always fighting with him for more notice, that her name should be in the book or that she would be recognized in some way as a participant.  She was an editor at one of the [unclear] magazines.  You probably know about this.  She was very important in his life for a while.\n\tAnyway, she wasn’t there for Beard on Pasta, and I got paid a flat fee for that, which was more than I had ever gotten paid for anything in my life.\n\nQ:  From the publisher?\n\nSax:  I can’t remember if it was Knopf or him.  I honestly don’t remember.  This was 1980.  Nor am I sure that I even would have known the difference.  I mean, I had no contract.  My name was never anywhere in the book.  If I was smarter, I would have arranged for that, but I was a housewife who was doing some writing, who really thought that I should be writing novels, but in the meantime, this was fun, this was good.  I was writing an occasional article, actually for Food and Wine.  I did a couple of pieces for Food & Wine.\n\nQ:  Under your name?\n\nSax:  In my own name, yes.\n\nQ:  But you also mentioned to me that you had worked on some articles with Beard.\n\nSax:  No, just these columns.  Just the columns.\n\nQ:  Destined for a magazine.\n\nSax:  Right.  So this is how it worked with Beard on Pasta.  It was wonderful.  I would take the subway down to Union Square and walk over to the house, and he would be both cooking and talking, and I’d be taking notes like crazy.  Richard [Nimmo] would be there, Clay [Triplette], of course, was there.  In the middle of the day, he would decide it was time to stop for lunch, and he always had stuff.  People sent him stuff, food, all the time, and he would make lunch.  I mean, I so specifically remember one thing that he made, which was he had jars of spaghetti sauce that he had been sent.  I guess he had been sent a carton of it.  He heated that up.  Of course we always had pasta, because that’s what he was working on.  He heated it up, tasted it, and squeezed an orange into it, and added some heavy cream, and it just transformed it.  That’s the only thing I specifically remember eating, although, no, I also remember that he was given a lot of gooseberries, which I had never eaten before, and he sent me home with some.  My mother-in-law, who was born in Russia, was visiting at the time, and she looked at them and she said the word in Russian.  She had never had them in the United States, but she only knew the Russian word for them.  They were wonderful.  They were ripe.  When you get ripe gooseberries.  So he would send me home with food sometimes, because they had so much.\nIt was a very friendly and collegial relationship.  I mean, I don’t mean—no, that’s the wrong word, because I certainly wasn’t on his level, but it was like a team working together.\n\nQ:  What was he like at that point?  Was he healthy?\n\nSax:  Oh yes.  Very fat, but healthy.  Barbara tells stories about bandaging his feet and things like that.  I did not have a physical relationship with him.  We were nice to each other.  I would get there in the morning.  He would be upstairs often talking on the phone, gossiping with people.  And then he would find his way downstairs and we would get to work.\n\nQ:  How did that work?\n\nSax:  I just took notes like crazy, and then I would go home.  Oh, by the way, at one point in there, I did a book on my own called Cooks’ Marketplace which was about shopping for food in New York, with 101 Productions, which was great.  I mean, I’ve done more than—\n\nQ:  1984.\n\nSax:  Okay.  So I may have been working on that at the time.  I would go home, I would transcribe certainly the recipes and try to think of head notes, and I would come back and I would ask him stories about the recipes if I didn’t have anything, so that I could then make that into a head note  I wrote all the chapter introductions, all that stuff.  But again, I have to insist, I mean, this was him; this was not me.  I didn’t know that stuff.  I’m sounding so humble.  I don’t mean to sound so humble.  This is what ghosting is.\n\tNow, the bad part of that is that when the book came out, I was a ghost.  Nowhere in that book was my name at all.  I just looked at it so that I could get the dates straight, and when I opened it, I saw that there was a note inside from Judith, saying, “Thank you for all your help.  I think you’ll be pleased with the final product.”  I mean, Judith was Judith.  She was a lady about it.\nBut, of course, at first my feeling was, she should have seen to it that I was in this book, and then I realized, nobody takes care of you.  If you’re a grownup in the world, you take care of yourself.  I wasn’t even invited to the book party.  I mean, nothing.  And the whole world was invited to the book party and I wasn’t.  But then I knew that, okay, I’d have to watch out for myself.\nNow, there was one further moment much later, when Judith was looking for someone to write an autobiography of him, and I went down and spent a couple of mornings talking to him and taking notes, and it clearly wasn’t going to work out.  It never came to life.  He was much older then, he wasn’t well, and he was telling kind of packaged stories, and also he had written a lot of this stuff in his book.  Then I think Evan [Jones] wrote a biography of him, and maybe that replaced the autobiography she was thinking of doing.  I don’t know.\n\nQ:  Was he comfortable with the idea of another biography?\n\nSax:  Oh yes.  Oh yes.  Now, this is something I’ve said to you before, and I just should talk about it a little bit now.  People just loved him.  I know that many people love him and worship him.  I really liked him and respected him.  He was a very smart person.  He knew more about food, with no bullshit, and very little self-aggrandizement.  I never felt that he was protecting his turf.  Now, maybe I didn’t see that side of him.  But it’s a small world, the food world, and you see people.  “Hey, I know about northern Italian cooking,” or, “I know about the microwave” or local food or something.  I really felt that he was a very smart man who had a wide range of interests.  However, I think that the kind of reputation that he’s had since his death is kind of unbelievably eminent, important, grandfatherly figure grows out of the books that he did with Judith, and I think that the books he did with Judith are completely different from the earlier books that he did.  If you look at his really early books, he was this caterer.  I mean, yes, he knew a lot, but he was kind of a bon vivant man about town.  The persona of the later books is of—\n\nQ:  The first of which was Beard on Bread.\n\nSax:  Beard on Bread.  Right.  Which I assume José Wilson did with him.  That I don’t know.  Judith would know that kind of thing.\n\nQ:  Yes, I believe that’s correct.\n\nSax:  It partly comes from the books that she created, and I’m talking about the typeface and the drawings and the very specifically sensual way that the recipes were written, as though this man is here with you, kneading the bread or rolling out the pasta, showing you how to do it.  I mean, I give her a lot of credit, not that he wasn’t very eminent and smart and knowledgeable, but the fact that the world knows that, I think a lot of that is from Judith.\n\nQ:  By then, of course, she had worked on Mastering the Art of French Cooking, which of course appealed to her in many ways, but one of them being that it explained process and technique in a way that she had never seen before.  I imagine some of that must have entered into the way Beard on Pasta was presented.\n\nSax:  I’m sure that you’re right.  I mean, now that I think of it, how did I know to write it that way?  I must have looked at Beard on Bread, to have a model.  And also actually the fact that I actually spent so much time down there, now that I look back on it, it’s amazing.  I mean, I took it as it was sort of like a part-time job.\n\tThe other thing is, because I did that book and people knew about that book, I did get other work.  I had pieces in Gourmet.  People knew that I did that, and I’m sure that the book I did with Felipe must have come from that, although that wasn’t a book with Judith; that was Simon & Schuster.\n\nQ:  When you were working with him and you would sit down to a meal, could you describe what that was like, whether the table was laid?\n\nSax:  No, the meal was always in the kitchen.  He had the kitchen which I know that the Beard House, the chefs who cook at the Beard House, hate cooking there, especially the people used to a restaurant kitchen, but it was just a perfect kitchen for him, because there was this counter, this U-shaped counter.  I guess it must have been his teaching kitchen.  I assume that his students sat around the outside and he taught in the inside.  But, yes, he’d be cooking in there, and I’d be sitting at the counter taking notes like crazy, and then when it was time to eat, we would sit there, and it would be me and Clay and Richard and Jim, all eating there.\nI remember being mostly impressed by his dishwasher, which was one of those super fast dishwashers.  I think it went through the whole cycle in ten minutes, and I desperately wanted one.  I’m sure it was a restaurant dishwasher.\n\nQ:  When was the last time you saw him?\n\nSax:  I suppose it must have been when Judith asked me to go and see if I could work on the autobiography.  As I said, he was clearly not well then.  He was short of breath.  He was fatter than ever.  I actually, when I think about it, maybe the fact that it didn’t work was partly because his brain was not what it had been.  I knew about him through Barbara.  I knew that she was still in touch with him, and through Marion Cunningham, who I remained in touch with for many years after Fannie Farmer.  But that’s about it.\n\tI really don’t have that much to say about him, I mean beyond that experience.  I did tell you that when we would be sitting downstairs sometimes, Gino [Cofacci], of course, lived upstairs.  Gino was the man who he had brought over from Italy.  He was an architect, quite different from Jim physically—slender, handsome, gray-haired.  Gino used to bake cakes for Alfredo’s restaurant around the corner.  I think they were meringue cakes; I don’t know.  But in the morning we’d be sitting down there and sometimes young men would be coming down the stairs, who had been spending the night with Gino.\nJim would talk about Gino, well, really in the way that any middle-aged man might talk about a wife that he felt was a burden, and a marriage that hadn’t lived up to the promise that it had started with.  Somehow I knew that.  I don’t know whether I knew this from him or from just gossip, that it just hadn’t worked out to be the relationship that he, Jim, had wanted it to be.\n\nQ:  Did your experience with him, presenting recipes with him, affect the way you think, cook, anything like that?  If you could describe that.\n\nSax:  Oh yes.  Oh yes, definitely, definitely.  I mean, I tend to be what Julian Barnes, the novelist, he’s written a little book called The Pedant in the Kitchen.  He follows recipes.  I tended to be that.  To the extent that I’m not that, which is not a great extent, is partly from sitting there.\nI just had a memory.  I just remembered something, which is of course my life with James Beard goes back much farther than that.  I was married in 1955, right out of college, as I’ve said.  I couldn’t cook at all.  I was this smart girl who was going to get a Fulbright.  I was going to do all this stuff.  And there I was, married and I had to cook because that’s what women did then.  I made some disastrous meals.  Then I was given a copy of The Fireside Cookbook, which I followed the recipes in this pedant-in-the-kitchen way, and the food was good.  It tasted good.  So that my first successful cooking came from James Beard.\nAnd he used to talk about that book.  Actually, he talked about it as a lesson to me, I think.  Of course, he did pay me.  It was he who paid me, because he didn’t want to pay more.  He would tell me how, when he did The Fireside Cookbook, he got a flat fee for it, but it didn’t matter because it made his reputation, and he used that to essentially say to me, “Don’t ask for royalties,” which I wouldn’t have dreamed of doing anyway, but he wanted to get it straight.  So, yes, in fact, I hadn’t forgotten it, but I had never put it together.  So, yes.\nIt did change my way of cooking, in the sense that he was so free, and he really did have a taste memory and he could imagine how things would taste.  It wasn’t like me, where at that point, if the recipe said half a teaspoon of basil, I mean, a half a teaspoon of basil, for chrissake.  What is that, a quarter of a leaf?  You know.  And, yes, he was very creative.  He really was.  I mean, that’s why, all in all, my experience with him was so positive.  I don’t worship him the way so many people do, but I really learned a lot from him and I met a lot of interesting people through him, and I got a good fee for it.\n\nQ:  Do you still have a copy of The Fireside Cookbook?\n\nSax:  No, I don’t.  Probably it was all stained and falling apart.  I really did use it.  But I did then buy another copy.  I bought a later copy.  I don’t know who worked on that, but one of the books that he did with Judith, I think it’s Theory and Practice Cookbook, I think that’s a wonderful book.  I just know that something like that, the idea for it must have come from Judith, yes, because it’s the way she thinks about cookbooks.\n\nQ:  Thank you.\n\nSax:  You’re welcome.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSax 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n","description":"A journalist and food writer, Irene Sax co-wrote Beard on Pasta and helped him prepare magazine articles.

The network was launched in November 1993 as TVFN with 6.8 million cable subscribers. Scripps, the Food Network's parent company, has started its own magazine based on the popularity of food programs and advertiser demand. In May 2010, Scripps initiated a second 24-hour network of food programming called The Cooking Channel.\r\n\r\nIt was Reese Schonfeld who got the Food Network going, developing the concept with a group put together by the Providence Journal Company's president Trygve Myhren. Schonfeld was a natural for the job. A longtime TV journalist and entrepreneur, he'd been the first president and chief executive of another big television success story, CNN, which he co-founded with Ted Turner in 1979.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewee:  Reese Schonfeld\t\t\t\t\t   \t   Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t      New York City\n\nDate:  August 18, 2009\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  I’m with Reese Schonfeld in his apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and it’s August 18th  [2009].  Good morning.  Thank you for letting me come talk to you.  It would be great if we could start with your telling me a little about when and where you were born and where you grew up, where you went to school, what your parents were like, that sort of thing.\n\nSchonfeld:  I was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1931, lived all of my life there until I went to college and then came to New York.  But my parents were first-generation born-in-America children of refugees from the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary, Slovakia, and Galicia to be exact.  They had, both of them, become totally Americanized, totally assimilated somehow or other, despite the fact that they grew up in Jewish households with Yiddish-speaking parents.  Both of them started work at fourteen, as soon as they got out of grammar school, because they needed to support their families.  My mother became a secretary for the New Jersey Public Service Utility Company, \n\n\n\n\n\nwhich did not employ Jews, and my father went to work as an office boy in a glass company in New York called Semon Bache.  Semon Bache was the father of Jules Bache.  It was an old German-Jewish company.\n\nWeinraub:  How do you spell that last name?\n\nSchonfeld:  B-a-c-h-e.  Jules Bache.  He ultimately rose to become a partner in that company.  We lived in Newark throughout my life, but then they moved to the Oranges later on after I’d gone on to college.\n\nWeinraub:  What kind of atmosphere was it like at home in terms of—well, you tell me.  They were working.  Did you have siblings?\n\nSchonfeld:  My mother didn’t work.  My father wouldn’t let her work.  She had been very successful and she was offered the job of being executive secretary to the New Jersey Philharmonic Association, but he refused to let her work, because in those days a man whose wife worked had to be shamed.  So she stayed home, very unhappily.  Unhappily is the wrong word, but bored.  She wanted to be an active woman, which she really was and was quite competent.\n\n\n\n\nWeinraub:  Do you have siblings?\n\nSchonfeld:  I have a younger brother and a younger sister.  My brother owned movie theaters in New Jersey and sold them at a very propitious time.  My sister married J. Clarence Davies, known as Terry Davies, who I consider the most important environmentalist in the United States that nobody’s every heard of.  He wrote the Toxic Substances Bill.  He was executive vice president of the Conservation Foundation.  He was deputy administrator of the EPA under George Bush Sr., went to the RFF, Resources for the Future, and between them, they both wrote the first textbook, my sister and brother-in-law, called The Politics of Pollution, the first ecology textbook that was used in the United States.\n\nWeinraub:  And what kind of education did you all have?\n\nSchonfeld:  All of us?  We all went to high school.  My sister went to a private school for high school.  Both my brother and I went to Weequahic High, which was famous.  It was mostly Jewish.  Phil Roth is the outstanding graduate of that school, I guess, although there are other worthies.  Then I went to Dartmouth.  My brother went to Penn and my \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsister went to Sarah Lawrence.  After Dartmouth, I got a master’s from Columbia in political science, then a law degree from Columbia.  I never practiced law.  I had been working for United Press Movietone News all the way through college and chose journalism over law.  It was 1960, had a chance to cover the Kennedy convention, the Nixon convention, and it wasn’t even a close call, the bar exam or that.  [laughter]\n\nWeinraub:  Before we move forward to that, since eventually we’ll get to the Food Network, do you remember any particular atmosphere surrounding food in your family home?\n\nSchonfeld:  No.  It was kosher, which means it was almost certainly—\n\nWeinraub:  Well cooked.\n\nSchonfeld:  —well cooked.  Right.  I didn’t have a particular taste for lox or cream cheese, which I do now.  Really, food was not real important in our lives.\n\nWeinraub:  Nor to your mother?\n\n\n\n\n\nSchonfeld:  No, not to my mother.  She cooked more-or-less.  It was fairly standard, steak on Sunday, chicken on Friday and Saturday.  I can still remember her making mashed potatoes and spinach so get us to eat spinach, but it was just, I would think, a very typical middle-class American home.  Subscribed to the Ladies’ Home Journal, the Saturday Evening Post, Time magazine, got the Newark Evening News and the New York Times every day, but my father read the Sun because he was a businessman and the Sun was the businessman’s paper.\n\nWeinraub:  And how did you get to UP Movietone News?\n\nSchonfeld:  When I went to Columbia, while switching from political science to law, I was looking for a summer job and Columbia found a job for me part-time at the New York Times, where I was working as a credit checker for the classified ads department.  Then they said there was a copyboy job open at United Press.  I went down there, and my boss, Bill Higginbotham, a great UP journalist—it was the UP still when I joined it; it \nbecame UPI maybe a year later—really was kidding me about Columbia because he thought I came from the  journalism school, which as a University of Missouri journalism \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrad, he despised. He was much relieved to know that I had only gotten a political science degree.  I got hired and I originally thought I’d got back to school at Columbia, but they (UPI) liked me and I liked them.  They had two shifts and they said they’d fit their schedule around me.  I could either be the six a.m. to two p.m. copyboy or the two p.m. to 8 p.m. copyboy, and that worked for me. I switched according to the courses I took.\n\nWeinraub:  And how did you, if you did, see your future at all?\n\nSchonfeld:  My future?  I didn’t really know.  It wasn’t until I was faced with the ultimate decision of going to have to choose between the bar and the—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Interruption]\n\nWeinraub:  We were talking about your being a copyboy there.  One of the things I’m interested in is that you didn’t do things in a traditional way at all.  I mean one could have gone or hoped to go from being a copyboy there to taking a very traditional path, but you always seemed to—\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, I worked for something called United Press Movietone News, which was television.\n\nWeinraub:  Yes, I understand that, but nevertheless, tell me what you thought you would do after that, I mean when you were—\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, already by the time I graduated from law school, I was already a reporter and deskman.  The training was fabulous and the ability to advance was fabulous, so that within a year, a year and a half, I was going out on stories, television reporter, did some stories that I was honestly proud of and I enjoyed.  I spent part of the summers down in Washington as a vacation relief man, covering the White House and \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongress and this going all the way back to Eisenhower days.  So I got the sense, the joy really, of journalism, which is still the greatest joy of my life and I care most about.\nBy the time I graduated from law school, I saw that I did have a future in journalism and that it was probably going to be much more to my liking than the law.  Friends of mine who were my lawyers later said, “You know, Reese, you would have made a lousy lawyer,” and they were right.\n\nWeinraub:  But you didn’t aim for the networks.\n\nSchonfeld:  No, no.  I had a chance to go to CBS, but I chose UPI over CBS because at CBS I would have been a page, which is where they started everybody, and here I saw a career path.  I’ve always loved being the little guy competing with the big guys.  Maybe it’s because it gives you an excuse for failure while they’re bigger than I am, but maybe it also gives you a sense of wonder when you can bring them down and make them change, as we did particularly with the news network, but also with Food, radically changing the TV environment with new, different content. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeinraub:  Well, let’s at least just get you to CNN in any case.  How much had you done with your career, if we could just go through that a bit, before CNN began and you and Ted Turner started it?\n\nSchonfeld:  Over the next ten years at UPITN, I became managing editor and vice president of United Press International Movietone News, which went through changes itself.  It became independent.  It was United Press International Television News.  Then we joined with the British network, ITN, and the job changed considerably.  When Burt Reinhardt, my boss then, made me do a budget with him, I suddenly discovered there was another world and had to take finance into account.  It’s too easy for a journalist when he’s working the streets to blame the suits for everything.  When all of a sudden you’re working for an underfunded company that’s got to survive and you’ve got to handle budgets yourself and make decisions, it imposes certain strictures.\n\tAlso at UPITN I did a lot of documentaries.  I was kind of the go-to guy there for a while.  I did the JFK story in part because Bill Higginbotham was so smart and said, “If JFK is going to win, this is going to be a wonderful film for Latin America, so do an English and Spanish half-hour on JFK,” which we did immediately.  And the USIA, in its lack of foresight, hadn’t [prepared] anything to [celebrate his victory]. They were so afraid of losing their jobs since they had no Kennedy film ready that they came in and bought our film and distributed it all over the world.  The USIA was so satisfied that we repeated that, and we did JFK: The First Year.  We did annual documentaries from 1960 to 1973.  \n\tI did a film called De Gaulle and the Six Day War, which I truly, truly loved and I thought was very, very good work.  Did some films for Encyclopedia Britannica.  UPI Movietone was a wonderful place to [learn filmmaking about sports and news. But, in trying to compete with the networks, we were crippled by the difficulty of delivering same day news to the stations]—the great strictures were the delivery, getting film to the delivery problem of news from us to stations.  The networks all leased twenty-four-hour-a-day video from AT&T. We did not.  We could not afford them.  That’s a long story that I’m not going to go into here, but—\n\nWeinraub:  Were they enormously expensive?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, yes, they were enormously expensive.  If we bought three and a half hours of time on a single day for seven days a week, [we would have paid as much as the networks paid for their 24 hour network].  If you tried to buy a half an hour or one hour, you had to pay [seven times as much as ]… the network, so it was a very effective bar \n\n\n\n\n\nto entry. The rates were set, I believe, with the concurrence of both AT&T and the three networks to [deter] competition. In 1972, we joined [an industry-wide anti-trust] lawsuit against AT&T.\n\nWeinraub:  About what?\n\nSchonfeld:  About the pricing of cross-country video communications.  Bill Henry, who had been chairman of the FCC under Kennedy, was our lawyer, and a very good lawyer, and we would have had a fairly good chance of winning the case, but I also was—and this I think is the most important thing in my career. [Pursuing satellite video delivery capability at ITNA, which I founded in 1975, was the second company to sign a satellite video delivery contract and the first… ] to cover news.  [Earlier].. HBO had signed a contract to deliver entertainment….ITNA] ( Independent Television News Association)  was modeled after the AP as a cooperative news service delivering news to a dozen independent (non-network) serving ten television stations.\n\nWeinraub:  And that was when you signed the satellite contract?\n\nSchonfeld:  Yes.\n\n\n\n\nWeinraub:  Which would have been about when?\n\nSchonfeld:  It would have been October or November of 1975.  In between, at UPITN, as UPITN was struggling to succeed, the Coors brothers decided they wanted to start a …[news feed] with a political bias. They called it TV New (TVN). Their bias, which Joe Coors later told me, was essentially they wanted to be a tug pushing the news more and more to the right, but slowly and ethically. To battle the competition UPITN formed a partnership with Paramount. But within a year, they had closed down their US operations….  Pat and I were the only two [UPITN] employees [who went to TVN] to run their documentary division rather than to be in hard news.  [But they needed me to get into hard news also.]\n        I had a one-year contract, and I was extremely unhappy with the company and what they were trying to do, and at the end of the one year, my contract was not renewed \non either side.  I’d have left even earlier to go to CBS, but the—within months.  I’ve been at meetings with the board of Coors, and there was great dissatisfaction [with TVN at \nCoors.] I can still remember when the CFO said, “You know, for what we’re losing on \nthis company, I could build a brewery on the East Coast.”  And they cut it [TVN] at the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAt the end of September, 1975 they informed all their clients that they were going to be out of business by November first, and so I had thirty days [in which] I went to  [prospective] clients and said, “Look, you guys have been so efficient and so price-conscious that you’re going to put your possible suppliers out of business.  Why don’t you form a cooperative?  You tell me how much you want to spend and I will go and organize the best news I can get for that kind of money,” and they agreed to do that.\n\tMostly it was a fellow named John Corporon, who was head of news at WPIX, and Corporon later became president of the Overseas Press Club, a first-rate journalist, another UP guy.  He was head of Channel 9 for Katherine Graham for a while.  So between the two of us, we brought the [Washington] Tribune Company [into ITNA].  We managed to hold Metromedia, which later became Fox, off, and so we got control of this and I ran it for four years or so before going down with Ted. In this period, I became quite well known in the news business, and we proved for the first time that you didn’t have to have a twenty-four-hour news and entertainment network to be able to deliver national, international news.  We were competitive in San Francisco.  Our news station had the best ratings of any local news in the city.  That was the Cox station, and they \nwere very well run.  It was a joy to do.  Ted was the only independent station of size who refused to join us.  For years he used to say, [imitating Ted Turner’s accent], “I hate news.  I’ll never do news.”  But in the end, he called and said one day, “Do you want to do it?”  And we talked and the opportunity was so great that he couldn’t resist it.\n\nWeinraub:  So explain to me exactly what you were doing when he called.\n\nSchonfeld:  I was running ITNA.  He said, “I got two questions for you, Reese.  You think a twenty-four-hour news network would work?  And if you do, would you run it for me?”  I said, yes, I did and we would talk about running it.  After we met in September of ’78 and talked about it, my ideas were different than his about what it should be like, and to my surprise, he accepted my ideas and we ran it on that model.  His original plan was \nto do four half-hour shows, one hard news, one women’s news, one sports, and one finance, and then just rotate them through the day, and I said that that wasn’t it, and he adopted the model that I chose.\n\nWeinraub:  Didn’t the prospect of this really very new idea excite you, what you could do with it?\n\nSchonfeld:  Oh, sure.  I mean it was—\n\n\n\n\n\nWeinraub:  Tell me about that.\n\nSchonfeld:  This was what I was born to do.  This was a moment in history where suddenly you could change news mostly because of a satellite.  You could just now bring news from all over the world in immediately and turn it into “live, live, and more live,” is what I used to say to people. We met with the New York Times, the editorial board, Ted and I, and the guy at the edit—when I told him what we were doing, said, “Aren’t you going to risk doing—?”  This is Brian Norquist, who was one of the editors, said, “Aren’t you going to cover an awful lot of one-alarm fires?”\n\tAnd I said, “Until the fire’s over, you don’t know whether it’s a one-alarm fire or the fire that burned down Chicago.”  And that was really my feeling, and it still is, about news, that if you can show people where you don’t know the end of the story and make them watch you because they want to see what the end of the story is, then you’ve won your audience.  It’s a shame that most networks have abandoned that, that all networks have abandoned that.\n\tEvery once in a while if you’re very lucky, you’re offered a job that you’re fully prepared for, that you’re the great person and maybe the only person who at least sees it that way, and that was sheer luck.  I mean, for all the troubles with Ted that I had, he \n\n\n\n\n\noffered me that opportunity.  It would never have happened without him or without me.\n\nWeinraub:  And what about money?  Was that going to be a worry for you or did he guarantee a certain amount of high budget or what?\n\nSchonfeld:  I did a budget and Ted—\n\nWeinraub:  With him or—\n\nSchonfeld:  No, on my own, and I told him it would probably cost about fourteen, fifteen million dollars to get it through a year, including building the network, twenty-four million, twenty-four million including building the network, fourteen or fifteen per year.  This was eighteen months, whatever, it was to build and run.  Anyway, Ted had a line of credit with First Chicago Bank.  I think that’s the name of the bank.  I’m not sure.  It was the bank run by Heineman, Ben Heineman.\n\nWeinraub:  Right, yes.\n\nSchonfeld:  Anyway, at a lunch in Chicago, oh, two or three weeks after I joined Ted, he made some unfortunate remarks about Jews.  Ted was off the wall about a lot of things, and one of his lines was, “Adolph Hitler had some good ideas,” a line like that.\n\nWeinraub:  That is off the wall.  [laughs]\n\nSchonfeld:  And Ben Heineman was in the audience.  I can’t confirm this story, because Ben Heineman’s son told me, “Ben says that unless you have proof of it, he didn’t do it.”  \nBut he wouldn’t comment on it, but it was reported he went back to his board and said—not his board, the people who worked for him and said, “Are we backing this fellow?  He has a line of credit with us?”  He said, “I don’t want to be involved with him.”  And they killed the line of credit and that gave us tremendous financial difficulties thereafter.\n\nWeinraub:  That would have been when?\n\nSchonfeld:  1979.  Ted had a television station in North Carolina that he was trying to sell and that was going to be twenty-four million dollars.  Group W was going to buy it, and then it was delayed because of protest from the black community.  His manager had unfortunately said some very foolish things about blacks and the station’s record with the black community was not good, so they were able to hold it up, which made getting money harder.  And then they had to get a settlement of a couple of million dollars, I \nthink.  In any event, so whatever we were getting was just that much less, and we were \nrunning on very, very short budgets.  Ted was not one to admit that even at the end.\n\tOne of my favorite stories, during the Falklands War, where we were beating the hell out of almost everybody, Ted was so—Ted was a sailor.  He loved that war.  It was a sea war.  Ted comes into the office and says, “Could we do better?”\n\tI said, “Sure, we could always do better.”\n\tHe said, “What do you think?”\n\tAnd I said, “Well, I just got a call from ITN,” or I got it a day or so afterwards, “saying that they want to build a barge in Brazil, would we go halfies on it with them.”\n\tI said, ‘What’s it going to cost?’\n\tHe said, ‘A million dollars.’”\n\tAnd I said, “Well, we need a million dollars or so to really do this.”\n\tHe said, “Do it.”\n\tAnd I said, “But [Bill] Bevins,” who was the CFO, “says we don’t have the money.”\n\tHe says, “Tell Bevins I’ll mortgage the house.”\n\tSo I go down and I tell Bevins this, and Bevins says, “Reese, the house is already mortgaged.”  [laughter]\n\nWeinraub:  How much of your time did you have to think about money and how much did you have for what the purpose of the network was?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, I ran the network on a daily basis.  Burt Reinhardt had come down with me now.  I’d been his number two.  He now was my number two, and he was looking \nafter the money and we were on budget.  Well, it was horrid, because even at the end of \nthe first seven or eight months when I told Ted I wanted to cut back on money to make the budget, Ted said, “Don’t.  I’ll raise the money.  You don’t worry about the money.  You spend what you have to spend.  Everybody tells me we have a great product.”  People wanted to invest in the network.  Ted twice turned down investors that would have made the company much easier to run.  Then when Group W launched a competitor in partnership with ABC, nobody wanted to invest until they saw who won that battle.  So after I left, it became very hard for him to raise money and he did wonderful things just to keep CNN alive.\n\nWeinraub:  All that said, you accomplished, or CNN accomplished quite a lot under your direction until you left.\n\nSchonfeld:  Oh yes.\n\nWeinraub:  So what was the reason that he fired you?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, we had a dispute.  I fired somebody.  He rehired her.  I would not allow that.  I had replaced her with [Tom] Braden and [Pat] Buchanan and I had created \nCrossfire, which was not what you ever saw on the air.  The Crossfire I created was going to be—which is why I had the name—one guest, the most important newsmaker of the day in the middle, with Buchanan asking questions from one side and Braden the other—\n\nWeinraub:  Oh, interesting.\n\nSchonfeld:  —and somebody caught in the crossfire, none of the shouting match.  But he wouldn’t put them on the air.  They finally threatened a lawsuit.  I was to be called as a witness because I had signed the contracts with them and brought them in, and he capitulated.  Instead of going on at ten, when they should have gone on, he put them on at \neleven-thirty.  They were so popular that he had to move them to seven o’clock, which meant he killed the sports show.  He had to run everything.  Ted’s ego was enormous, \ngreater than mine and I’m a—I don’t—  [laughs]  But in the end, I had a 1 rating.  The best ratings for a six-month period CNN ever got, I got six months from the first of 1980 to June of ’82 and I was fired at the end of May.  After that, their ratings went down and they stayed down, and they’ve never gotten back up to that level on a consistent basis ever since.\n\nWeinraub:  Interesting.\n\nSchonfeld:  But I’ve always said my problem was that if I could get a 1 rating, if I proved it was successful, Ted said, “Okay, now it’s successful.  I can run it myself without anybody else around.”  He offered me the job back.  He fired me, then held the job open six months, offered me to come back and I probably should have, looking back.  I’d have owned more of the company if I had and it would have been better life, but it also would have meant having to live with him and having him think he had me by the balls, and that was no way to live.  I watched Ted treat other people, and if he thought he owned them, he would shame them in front of their wives.  He would deliberately—it just wasn’t worth it.\n\nWeinraub:  So that ended in 1982, and between then and the early nineties, how did you see yourself?  Were you looking for a particular project or where you going from project to project?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, I worked for Cox for a year, where I discovered Shopping channels, and we built one in New Orleans that was later sold for six million dollars to the national ones.\n\nWeinraub:  Well, that was a new idea, yes?\n\nSchonfeld:  Yes, it was and—\n\nWeinraub:  And did that appeal to you, the new—\n\nSchonfeld:  No, not particularly.  I got somebody else, Jerry Hardy, who was a terrific guy who created Time Life Books.  He got involved, and of course he was much better at \nthat, direct marketing, than I was and we went partners with that.  But even as we were doing it, we discovered that these people were doing it, for example, Home Shopping Network, but they were doing it and we got everybody excited about it.  But Cox was a strange company.  I had gotten a very good deal there.  The other executives were very unhappy, and I just didn’t feel comfortable working in the atmosphere.\nI had an offer from Chuck Dolan to come to New York and start what is now News 12.  So I went up there for two years, I think, and worked with Chuck, and at the end of that—it wasn’t much fun for me or for Chuck.  I did a book channel there that Chuck really wanted to do, and it didn’t work and I think that was my fault.  I hired the wrong talent for it.  But it wouldn’t have worked anyway.  There was no financial base \nfor it.  I’d wanted to do a book service, a book critic at CNN, and I sent the advertising \nguys out to go to publishers and publishers wouldn’t advertise.  They said people who watch television don’t read books.  Oprah [Winfrey] has proved them wrong, but not very much wrong.\n\nWeinraub:  I guess what I’m getting at, though, is that you seemed to be open to new ideas about how to use this new cable process.\n\nSchonfeld:  Oh, sure.  Yes, there were loads of things.  A book channel would have been wonderful if you could have had financing for it.  What’s his name?  [Brian] Lamb did a wonderful job, but that was philanthropy.  That’s not a business.\nThen after that I did a couple of jobs with Time magazine people.  I’m trying to remember what order this was, but I did People magazine on television for Time and CBS, and that was some of the best shows I’ve ever, ever, ever, ever done.  I don’t know if you saw Joyce Wadler’s story in Time about Shi Pei Pu.  We produced that and she got the place wrong.  It was at Maxim’s, not Versailles, that we did the show.  But it was very good television and it was great, great, great fun to do.\n\tAfter that, I worked with them on what I think was the best idea.  1991, ’92, those years, foreign countries still were just beginning to understand cable and what it was like, and with Time Magazine Division, we planned the International Business Channel, which \nwas a plan that I had where we would cover twenty-four hours worth of financial news going with all the markets.  Did all the research.  There are only three hours a night, or four hours, when there were no markets open, so we would be live with markets and we would find partners in each area of the world.\n\tPart of the time I was working with TASS [Soviet news agency].  We had a period where we were trying to take TASS private and make it into a true news agency, keeping the same employees.  We wouldn’t have run it.  We knew that.  But the idea being that TASS, which had always considered itself a propaganda agency, so I was close to them and TASS would have been our partner in Russia.  In Germany, Capital, a Gruner and Jahr, Bertelsmann’s magazine would have been our partner.  These were all things I had done and arranged in the interim.  I was talking with people in Japan, Richard Li of Star TV in Hong Kong, as to who would be our partner in Asia, cover those hours.\n\tThe idea was simple, that they could come in, they could take our service, and they could then, when they felt comfortable, begin to do their own service over ours.  But we would always share in their advertising revenue, as they would share in ours, and we would all become partners.  To do this, HBO wanted to be partners with this.  The Magazine Division would not allow them to be partners, so they became our rivals, and this was a sixty- or sixty-five-million-dollar project.\n\tThis was just at the time when Steve Ross got sick.  Nick Nicholas had approved it \nand it was going forward when Steve got sick, and this is a story I’ve only heard from one source.  I know what happened.  So when Steve got sick, Nicholas was passed over \nand it went to Levin.  That’s fact.  But according to my source who was in the Magazine Division, there was a guy who was at Time Warner, who was running HBO International \nand who was the guy who had been cut out of our deal, who was very close to Steve Ross.  The story goes that he had been Steve Ross’ inside man at Paramount when Steve \nwas competing with Paramount to take over Warner Bros., and anyway, he moved from Paramount and went with Steve.  And Levin, according to this story, wanted this guy to back him with Ross and, “Tell Steve that I’m better than Nick,” and all that.  And the guy said to him, “Can I have Reese’s sixty-five million dollars?”\n\tAnd Harry said, “Yes.”  [laughs]\n\tI was in TASS when this happened, which is a wonderful part of the story, where up there in TASS where they’re watching CNN, they saw Nick Nicholas’ face and Gerry Levin’s face and they’re telling the story, and I start to explain it and the guy from TASS says, “Don’t.  We know a coup when we see one.”  [laughs]\n\nWeinraub:  So by the time the Providence Journal Company reached out to you, you had, obviously, extensive experience throughout cable—\n\nSchonfeld:  Yes.\n\nWeinraub:  —having done a whole variety of projects, and I’ve read that they were looking for somebody who was the kind of guru, in fact, that you were at that point.\n\nSchonfeld:  I’m not sure that that was the only reason.  They knew I was going to be straight with them, and the story that I got was that Johnson and Wales, which is the famous cooking school, was also one of the largest employers in Providence, and maybe the largest landowner, a great advertiser in the Providence Journal, probably mostly classifieds, but was interested in doing a food network.  So they just wanted somebody to give them an honest answer of whether it would work or not, and they came to me.\n\tI had previously been approached by a couple, Madie Land and—a couple I had introduced to each other years before.  Madie had worked for me at the ITNA project, and her husband, Allen Reed is his name, they were married, and they had been doing a lot of work for the Nashville Network and they believed that a food network would work.  And they had come to me, and I said, “Sounds like a great idea, but we don’t have a platform to stand on and we can’t do it.”  I said, “There’s no way you can go out now and just be Reese, maybe, and Allen and get support for this.”  When the Journal called—the Journal, at the time, owned a million cable homes and was part of a consortium of small cable owners that owned them—\n\nWeinraub:  This was the Journal Company’s Cable Division, is that right?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, no, it was Tryg Myhren who effectively ran the whole company.  He \nwas COO, but he was running the whole company and he came out of cable.  Tryg had been head of Time Warner Cable and he was a very good executive, maybe the best executive I’ve ever worked with.  This was under him, and he knew me from Time Warner, Turner days because I’d had to pitch him on why we, Turner, should be the ones to do this.  By the way, Ted had called Gerry Levin and had called the head of Teleprompter, then the largest cable, and invited them each to take a one-third interest.  This was in ’79 and they both turned him down, but it’s another story.\n\nWeinraub:  To get to Tryg Myhren for a second, their interest or his interest seemed to be in a cable company that was entirely supported by ads.\n\nSchonfeld:  I didn’t learn that until after—he asked me, “Do you think it could work without fees?”  I said yes.\n\nWeinraub:  You mean as a food network or just—\n\nSchonfeld:  As a food network.  Food Network is one of the few things that could have succeeded and did succeed without ads, and it makes a great deal of money now and gets still minimal fees.\n\nWeinraub:  And why was that a natural for succeeding without ads?\n\nSchonfeld:  Because food programming was so inexpensive to produce, at least the way we did it in those days, and because advertisers, it would so directly appeal to certain advertisers, a natural advertising constituency and at cheap operating costs.  That alone should have been enough to convince anybody, but it was hard.  Another thing was could we get homes to carry us, and even if all the people in the group that we put together had said it would only have been five or six million homes, which wasn’t nearly enough, but at that point, Rupert Murdoch had made a deal. The laws were changing and this gets somewhat complicated, where, thanks to Jay Kriegel at CBS, cable companies now had to get the approval of the networks, the broadcast stations, to carry them, and everybody thought it was going to be a lot of money.  But Rupert had this great idea and he went to John Malone who was head of TCI, the nation’s largest cable company, and said, “John, wouldn’t it be better if you just gave us room to build our own cable channel, didn’t charge us any money for two years, and then after two years we’d pay you twenty cents a month for the channel?”  And that seemed to me a good model.  NBC loved the model and said that was how they built MSNBC was on that model.  ABC wanted to do another sports channel, so ESPN2 came out, and they all had the special need for it.\n\nWeinraub:  So it was a very creative time in cable at that moment.\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, it was an opportunity that even the dopes who controlled—no, I shouldn’t say, because what’s his name—[Laurence] Tisch refused to let CBS do this.  I went to Tisch with another cable channel at the time about starting the Hallmark channel.  I was on the board of Halmi at the time, and they turned us down.  Halmi would have been backed by Hallmark Cards, and it was a natural thing for them.  They had all the CBS stations, and he said no, he wasn’t going to do anything with cable.  He hated it.  He hated Kriegel.  He hated everybody at that point.\n\tBut I knew the Tribune people very well because they had been my partners in the Independent Television News Association, so I knew the stations they owned and I called Jim Dowdle, who ran the network, and said, “Would you be interested?  It’s a Providence Journal concept,” which makes them happy because they’re all part of the newspaper brotherhood.  “I know those Providence Journal guys.  They’re good guys.”  So it made it very easy.\n\tThey came in, and each of their broadcast stations, like WPIX, New York, WGN, Chicago, had the right to say you can either carry us or not carry us, but if you carry us, you’re going to have to carry the Food Channel too.  And they gave us ten and a half million homes, which got us to about fifteen million altogether promised over two years, which was enough to convince people to invest.  And then Tryg, on his own, lined up Continental Cable at the end for one last partner.\n\nWeinraub:  Now, somebody—at that point, I don’t know whether it would have been Johnson and Wales or all of you—must have assessed how the previous food television programming was going.  I mean, there wasn’t much of it, but there had been some, yes?\n\nSchonfeld:  Johnson and Wales dropped out fairly soon.  They wanted to do purely instructional stuff, and we finally offered them because they brought the idea—we said, “We’ll give you six to seven in the morning and you can do purely Johnson and Wales.”  They didn’t want that.  They didn’t want to put in the eleven million dollars that each partner had to put in, so they just said, “No thanks.”\n\nWeinraub:  I guess what I’m saying is, though, there must have been some thought to would the public be remotely interested in a food-related channel.\n\nSchonfeld:  I never had a doubt about that.\n\nWeinraub:  Tell me why.\n\n\n\n\nSchonfeld:  Magazines.  You have food magazines that were great successes, and you had Julia [Child], who was a great success, and Jacques [Pépin], who was a—it worked for PBS.  If it could work for PBS, it could certainly work for cable, and there were enough of those shows around that it proved it.  But no one had really thought about doing it on a twenty-four-hour-a-day basis, where you’d have to go out and find chefs and do programming.\n\nWeinraub:  So first you had to establish some kind of a business model and a model for having the programs be carried, yes?\n\nSchonfeld:  Yes, the carriage was the most important thing, the cable, always.\n\nWeinraub:  Actually, when I got to Washington, D.C. Cable didn’t carry the Food Channel for a long, long time.  It was very irritating.  But I’m not quite sure why.\n\nSchonfeld:  I really can’t say why.  We weren’t paying to be carried over.  That was the big problem.  While I was there, I didn’t have any money in there to pay for carriage.  We were used to having people pay us and we weren’t going to pay if we weren’t going to get money back from it.  So in the end, after I left, they did start paying for carriage and that’s how they finally got on to a lot of channels.\n\n\nWeinraub:  Who started paying for carriage?\n\nSchonfeld:  The Food Channel did, and the Food Network paid for coverage and it got on to a lot of cable, but it was pure stupidity on the part of all the cable owners.  They got a \nchunk up front and they had to pay for the next fifty years.  They’re still paying for it, for the Food Network.  But this is American business.  It’s very shortsighted.  “If it’s going to make me look good this year on my budget that I brought in this much money and I get my bonus on how we did this year, let’s take the money up front.”\n\tI have a story here which is in the book [Me and Ted Against the World:  The Unauthorized Story of the Founding of CNN, by Reese Schonfeld].  A guy named Leo—he’s very famous and very rich now.  He’s still on cable.  Hendrey, Leo Hendrey,  Anyway, he had owned about a million cable homes and I was trying to get him to carry it instead of carrying Fox News, which was going to charge him twenty cents a month for the next ten years.  I said, “You get us for nothing.”  I said, “You could borrow the—.”  I think they were offering him—I can’t even remember—whatever it was.  They were offering a dollar a sub or thirteen dollars a sub for a million subs, so it was thirteen million dollars.  “You could borrow all the interest on it and save it.”\n\tHe said, “Reese, you don’t understand.  I get the thirteen million dollars now.  The phone company I sell my cable system pays it off for the next ten years,” and he sold it.  \nAll these guys at this time in history were the sellers of their systems.  Malone sold TCI.  They all were bought by AT&T, which later just about went broke with what they paid \nfor the cable systems. So it was tough getting on without paying fees, and I suppose if I had been smarter, been able to raise more money from the original investors, we would have paid more money and gotten on.  But I think the Post was just like the rest.  They wanted to be paid to carry the network.\n\nWeinraub:  But just to be clear, all of you had to work out the business model before the intricacies of the content were established.\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, yeah, but not that part of the budget because we didn’t know that Murdoch was going to do this.  We had a totally different budget.\n\nWeinraub:  No, I understand.  But what I mean is the initial motivation was not dominated by “This content is so fabulous that everybody will want it.”\n\nSchonfeld:  Oh, you mean the television station would want it?\n\nWeinraub:  Yes.\n\nSchonfeld:  No, we were not so foolish.  Cable systems were run by men.  They were not \ngoing to appreciate it.  There were a lot of men who couldn’t imagine an audience watching it.  I’m not at all a gender kind of thing.  I’m not talking about discrimination and ordinarily I wouldn’t say this, but this was absolutely our experience in the field.  Sometimes there would be women who were program managers who would recommend it to her bosses and her bosses would just say no.  They didn’t think it would appeal.\n\nWeinraub:  They couldn’t imagine people watching or—\n\nSchonfeld:  They couldn’t imagine men watching it.  They couldn’t imagine themselves watching it, and since we all generalize from our own experience, they just couldn’t imagine it ever succeeding.  And now, as you know, it’s one of the top ten networks in the country in demographics.\n\nWeinraub:  Was it always imagined as a twenty-four-hour deal?\n\nSchonfeld:  Oh, yeah, always.  It isn’t twenty-four now because they do three or four hours for infomercials.  I fought that, but I lost that battle because we needed the money.  But I originally thought we could do twenty-four hours without infomercials.\n\nWeinraub:  But initially you needed a certain amount of money to launch.\n\nSchonfeld:  Right.\n\nWeinraub:  And you needed an agreement with cable companies to pick up, yes?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, yeah.  We needed a number of homes that we could guarantee, and so we got eleven million dollars, I think, from six companies for sixty-six million bucks raised to do the programming, and the guarantee that over a period of time we’d get the fifteen million homes.  Over two years we’d have them.\n\nWeinraub:  And would the network itself be responsible for getting all the ads or—\n\nSchonfeld:  Yes.  We had an advertising department headed by a guy named George Babick, who was at the Tribune Company and quit the Tribune Company to come to us.  He was another guy I knew from CNN and he put together a pretty good team.  His successor, a woman that he had found from CNN, is still the head of advertising sales.  I forget her name, but she’s terrific.  We’ll probably want to talk to her at some point if we can.\n\nWeinraub:  Now, meanwhile, though, you had to get viewers, so that meant that what you \nestablished for content would have to be appealing for viewers.  So I realize you’ve written about this, but why don’t you talk about how you imagined the content would work and why.\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, I saw it more as a woman’s service magazine would have been than just pure food.  So from the beginning we had a great deal of food, but we did do an exercise show, had one of the Joyner sisters, who was an Olympic medalist, leading women in exercise early in the mornings.  We had a diet show, where I got one of the best diet doctors still in the world, a guy named Lou Aroni, who’s over at Cornell.  I’m not sure. \n[The next few comments deleted at the request of Schonfeld.] \n\tAnd we did an hour diet with a woman named Gayle Gardner, who had been a great star of cable, the first woman on ESPN, beautiful redhead who had grown quite \nheavy.  So her battle was part of the story, and they would interview people and talk to \nthem about diet and that was an hour show.  One of the people who worked for me, Joe Langhan, who was a very good programming guy, said that all the women he knew, the second thing they talked about after sex was diet.  [laughter]  And the problem is they didn’t want to talk about diet in public, I don’t think.\n\nWeinraub:  At what point were you put in charge of the whole thing?\n\nSchonfeld:  Immediately, from the beginning.\n\nWeinraub:  I mean, I’m asking for a date.\n\nSchonfeld:  July of ’93, I guess.  Yes.\n\nWeinraub:  So at that point—\n\nSchonfeld:  We had the money raised.  We signed the contract in July.\n\nWeinraub:  Not ’92?  A little earlier, yes?  Well, we can sort that out.\n\nSchonfeld:  I don’t think we really had the money fully raised till July of ’93, and we went on the air in September in one form and then in November in another.  And finally, on February first of ’94, we had the full network in our own studios.  Pat built the studios [unclear].\n\nWeinraub:  Yes, and we can get to that.  I see.  So that you didn’t have the full twenty-four-hour programming at the very beginning?\n\nSchonfeld:  No.  We gradually built up to it.  We always had twenty-four hours, but more of it was repeats.  We bought the Diane Lucas Show in black and white from CBS.  I’m sure you’ve seen all this.\n\nWeinraub:  Yes.\n\nSchonfeld:  And that was a show we ran twice a day, even though it was really hopeless for ratings, black and white by that time.  But we were using it as filler while we found great talent of our own.\n\nWeinraub:  And what was the other filler that you had used at that point, that you were using?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, it just wasn’t filler.  We had Emeril from the very beginning.  We had Field’s, the cookie lady, Mrs. Field’s Cookies, and we had her.  I loved her, although she did not succeed ultimately.  We had a show which we called Chef du Jour, which was essentially Chef du Week because we would try out various chefs to see who was good, they’d come in, they’d do five shows, which we would run for a week, and if we liked them, we would then go back to them and suggest that maybe we could build full shows around them.  And we went out and we bought Julia Child’s show, which also was great programming.\n\nWeinraub:  You bought from public television the original—\n\nSchonfeld:  The originals, yeah.  That story’s, again, an interesting story, where before we started, we offered them a million dollars for the show.  The Journal said they would throw in extra money for it.  On the board of the Journal was the head of the PBS station \nin Boston who owned the shows, and he had to take himself out of it because of conflict of interest.  So he let his program director, a woman, make the decision and she was living with a chef at the time.  And the chef said, “Oh, Julia’s worth a hell of a lot more than a million dollars.”  [laughs]  So they turned it down, and six months later we bought \nit for half a million dollars from the Boston Public Television station.\n\nWeinraub:  Let’s just imagine the programming day, re-imagine the programming day as you saw it.  You had hired Donna Hanover and David Rosengarten.\n\nSchonfeld:  Yeah.\n\nWeinraub:  And how did they fit into the programming?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, we wanted to do a news show called Food News and Views, which would have been an hour a day of food around stories, whether it was—we covered the FDA in Washington and we covered the latest openings of restaurants.  It was every kind of food.\n\nWeinraub:  And is that what she did?\n\nSchonfeld:  Donna and David were co-anchors of that show, and I hired Henry, Tony Hendra, who was a foodie.  He was in—what’s the famous rock send-off band?  Carl Reiner.  Not Carl.  Rob Reiner.  Oh, why am I blocking it?  It’s a movie that everybody knows [Spinal Tap].  Tony was in that, but Tony was also a foodie.  And I got Barbara \nKafka, and that turned into a kind of Crossfire, the conservative Tony against the liberal Barbara on food issues.  And they became part of that show.\n\tThen we did another half-hour called Taste with David Rosengarten as well.  David came through with the idea for Taste, the title, but David wanted to have different chefs on the show and we said no.  I was particularly fond of that show because I designed the set for it, over everybody’s objections, and I still think it was the best.  I don’t know if you remember.  It was steel appliances over a white background and with a red-and-white ticker tablecloth, where David would sit down with somebody at the end of the show and discuss what they had done on the Taste.  I liked that show, and the show worked well and Emeril worked well.\n\nWeinraub:  I’ll get to him in a second.  So you were trying to appeal to a lot of different bases or what?  You were trying to fill out what you saw as possible content?\n\nSchonfeld:  Yeah, we had hired a woman named Sue Huffman, who had been the food editor at the Ladies’ Home Journal and we talked with her about things because she had experience in that.  She was a friend of Julia’s, which helped us with Julia from the beginning.  She was knowledgeable.  I got the Jacques Pépin shows.  I called the station in San Francisco and there was a wonderful woman there.  I wish I could remember her \nname.  I can try to find it for you.  Regina, Regina somebody, who cared about the shows.  She was very helpful and we bought the shows from them, and Jacques was wonderful.  So we had his shows.  We had Julia’s shows.  We had Emeril.  We had Field’s.  We had Chef du Jour.  I’m trying to think of other chef shows.  If you don’t mind, if you turn off this, I’ll talk to Pat and see if she remembers.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nWeinraub:  Okay, so let’s talk then about what the pieces of the programming day that you thought to be essential were.\n\nSchonfeld:  I thought that in prime time, at ten o’clock we should have a general talk restaurant program, and that I looked for a name.  I wanted one name to start the network, and that was Robin Leach because he was available.  He had worked for me at the very beginning of the Food Network, and he was more than willing to do it and he was good.  So we got him.\n\nWeinraub:  And he was well known as a rich and famous—\n\nSchonfeld:  As a rich and famous person.  He was a name that every cable operator would \nknow.  “Oh, who’s your star?”\n\t“We got Robin Leach.”  That meant something to them.  And ten o’clock at night was his time.  It was a perfect time slot for him.  I thought it was soft and—excuse me.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nWeinraub:  Okay, so you were talking about Robin Leach filling that hour.\n\nSchonfeld:  That hour, and then I’m trying to remember who went on before them.  As I recall it, that was the original schedule, six to seven for the news program.  News and Views are six to seven, and seven to eight was the diet show with Aroni.  Eight to nine, as I recall it, we used Emeril and Sally Field, and nine to ten we used Julia and Jacques.  Then we would repeat most of those shows during the course of the day.  I’m trying to remember the other shows.  I know I had the exercise program.  We had Taste, which would have been on in prime time.\n\nWeinraub:  And Taste was—\n\nSchonfeld:  That was the David Rosengarten half-hour.  That was a good show.  Oh, and \nwe had the restaurant show, which originally started with David and Nina Griscom, and then David was too negative, so we switched from David to Alan Richman, who you know, of course.  It wasn’t the problem that it was criticizing restaurants.  I got complaints from viewers, “Why are you talking to me and telling me in a half-hour about a restaurant that you don’t want me to go to?”  [laughter]  So it didn’t work as a warning thing.  Then Pat did do sixty-five shows with Marion Cunningham and they got integrated in a program.\n\nWeinraub:  And that is what you had to build the teaching studio for.\n\nSchonfeld:  The studio.  We had half dozen different sets in the studio, three on each side, and three of them were kitchen shows.  I’ve totally forgotten one of the good shows that we used, another from the very beginning, Michelle Urvater doing how to feed your family on $100 a week.  That was, again, the idea of a women’s service show.  You wanted to help people.  She did a terrific job, as good as she could, but looking back, it was kind of a mistake, because in the daytime, with women working, it wasn’t my mother’s day.  It was working women that aren’t going to be around to watch that show and it wasn’t a prime time show either where you’re looking for a male, female audience.\n\nWeinraub:  How much of the programming was designed to bring in ads?\n\nSchonfeld:  It was all designed to bring in ads, but nothing particular.  It wasn’t as if a sponsor said, “We want this show.  Please do it.”  We didn’t have any sponsor programming in the beginning of the network.  I don’t know what they do now.\n\nWeinraub:  So how did that work?\n\nSchonfeld:  Food companies wanted to be on the network.  We got P & G and we got General Foods from day one, not with big buys, but with large enough buys, and Alcoa came in very early.  We would throw in, to get them, that if they didn’t do commercials—it wasn’t Alcoa.  It was Reynolds Wrap.  If they didn’t have commercials, we’d do a commercial for them free, and Reynolds Wrap brought in two ladies and we shot it in our studio when the studio was down, and then they did the advertising run for whatever shows they wanted to do.\n\nWeinraub:  So as the programming was designed, was it designed specifically to bring in ads or they were two separate paths?\n\nSchonfeld:  It was designed to bring in audience because the audience brings in ads.  The basic world of television, which somebody may not have told you, is we don’t sell ads.  \nWe sell our audience.  The ad buyers buy how much of our audience they deliver.  I learned that very early from a guy who was totally disgusted by it, a guy named Teddy Fedders, who was a theater man and had been in television, and Worthington Minor, who was one of the great pioneers of drama on television.  Teddy worked for Minor, and he turned to Teddy once and said, “Teddy, these people aren’t like us.  They \nsell their audience,” and that is the business of television.  So everything we did was designed to bring in an audience because the advertisers follow the audience.\n\nWeinraub:  And how well did that work?  How did your audience grow?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, the first book we ever had, which was really the last one published since the last quarter I was in charge, we got a .3, which was what we had predicted.  The story comes later, but after that, it went down to between twos and threes and it stayed down there with my successors until Jerome came in years later.  That was when the rise in audience began, well, when they had more money, when they had a greater base of viewers, a larger universe on which to draw to create an audience.  That’s the way you plan a network.  “We’re going to get an audience of 15 million people.  That’s going to grow to 75 or 80 million people in five years, so programming isn’t going to cost us any more money,” but it always does cost you more because if you’re programming to a budget in the beginning, your budget expands as you get a wider and wider audience.\n\n\nWeinraub:  Did the audience grow beyond your expectations or according to your expectations?\n\nSchonfeld:  It was according to my expectations.  I thought it would be about a .3 audience was what I believed and it was that in the first book we had from Nielsen.\n\nWeinraub:  And translated to civilians, what does a .3 audience mean?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, right now CNN has about a .5 audience, so this was a fair number.  The Food Network has an audience higher than a .5, in general.  Among the news networks, only Fox has more of a total audience than Food does, and in all the demographics, Food beats Fox.  The demographics are 25-54.  Advertisers don’t want to pay for people over 54, although I understand there is now a 35-65 count too, maybe as the population ages.  So we were probably about 60 percent of a CNN audience in the beginning.\n\nWeinraub:  That sounds like a lot to me.\n\nSchonfeld:  Yes, it was fine.  Well, that’s because CNN dropped so much.  It was 30 percent of the audience I left CNN with, but that was all we really counted on, knowing \nwe’d have to improve our programming and get more publicity. In addition to doing the things that we’ve mentioned here, we did specials.  We did documentaries.  Jacques and his son or his nephew—I think his nephew—built a restaurant in Connecticut, so we did a documentary on how you build a restaurant.  We covered the James Beard Awards.  We went to Aspen Food Festival with Food & Wine and we covered those things.  I was big on specials.  We took a whole day a year to call Let’s Make Sure Everybody Eats, where we got tremendous philanthropic support, we got all sorts of entertainers.  I can remember Judy Collins and Harry Shearer and [George] Foreman, the fighter, who later became a spokesman for the grill.\n\nWeinraub:  The George Foreman grill, yes.\n\nSchonfeld:  He was a natural for it.  George Foreman, right.  So there were plenty of people around who wanted to help.  The Tisch brothers were very supportive of that.  Danny Myer was.  We did Ruth Reichl.  Ruth did one week with Marion Cunningham, who was her mentor, and I got to know Ruth pretty well and we’re still friendly.\n\nWeinraub:  Let’s talk a little bit about some of the people who became real stars.  What appealed to you about Emeril in the first place?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, Emeril did two shows for us that failed in the beginning.  They were not produced by us.  The people who had first come up with the idea for the Food Network were very helpful in giving me ideas about it from their experience with chefs and people, and they were the ones who suggested Emeril and Field.  They did the two shows.  They failed in getting ratings, but we saw the talent in Emeril, and we went down to New Orleans and asked him if he would be willing to do a show called Essence of Emeril and it would be all him.  He had been doing shows creating other chefs’ recipes.  He immediately became a story, so the rating boomed when he was there.\n\nWeinraub:  He likes the idea of that?\n\nSchonfeld:  Oh yes.  Why not?  It’s his hits.  We were partners with him in the food sales for the product if we permitted him to mention it on the air, which we did.  My successors didn’t understand and gave back the 10 percent.  [laughs]  We’d be worth millions now, but anyway.  So with him, and we were bringing Sally Field up to New York to have her do a different show.  She had very long fingernails.  I don’t know if you remember that.\n\nWeinraub:  No.\n\nSchonfeld:  And the questions that we got about her was, “How does she bake with those fingernails?”  So we turned that into our line, “Sally Field, how does she bake with those fingernails?”  [laughs]\n\nWeinraub:  And what about Mario Batali?  How did that come about?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, Mario was discovered by a guy who worked for me, who saw him at the restaurant, and we brought him in, and Pat put him on the air on Chef du Jour and immediately recognized his talent.  Pat produced his first shows. It was after I left that he started the half-hour shows and Pat produced those shows for him.\n\nWeinraub:  Molto Mario was when you were there or after?\n\nSchonfeld:  I named Molto Mario.  I created the show, but by the time we started doing it or started—I guess we started doing it while I was still there, but then it was after I left that it got on the air because I left in—I forget what month, but whatever it was. The story there—and I don’t know if you want to get to it now—is that my contract gave me the right to do fifty to sixty days a year working for another company and the BBC approached me with bringing them to America.  And when I did it, the Journal had not revealed to the—\n\n[Interruption]\n\nWeinraub:  You started to talk about the BBC, but let’s just go back to that in a second, because I want to ask you about your getting the rights to the Iron Chef program.\n\nSchonfeld:  I didn’t.  That was done after me by Eric Freund and I would not have done that.  I’m not going to kid you.  I would never in the world—I was still sitting on the board of the company at the time, and I thought that was the silliest show.  The idea of putting a Japanese language show, it was the silliest thing in the world.  The Food Network probably would not have been nearly as successful and we didn’t have the money for it either.  See, Erica and her group, the second people, were not restricted.  We made—\n\nWeinraub:  Restricted to?\n\nSchonfeld:  By budget.  They just violated all their budget restrictions.  It was one of the reasons I was very unhappy with the network spending money, $450,000 for a new logo, \nthat kind of thing.  Having been brought up at United Press, you knew United Press’ reputation for being cheap.  Everything we did had to be very carefully handled, and so all this money being thrown around….  I didn’t have the BBC show that was so good, The Two Fat Ladies.  Is that what they called it?\n\nWeinraub:  Yes.\n\nSchonfeld:  They bought that show after I left and that show was of some help, but there weren’t a lot of those shows.  The BBC does small runs.  Iron Chef just kept going and going and going, and I think that if there was any single program—after Emeril, we established a network.  If there was any program that really made a difference, it was Iron Chef.  I recognize that.  Another thing that I did, which was here and you probably don’t know it, although it’s in the investigation of Rudy Giuliani.  [laughter]\n\nWeinraub:  I probably don’t.\n\nSchonfeld:  Donna was married to Rudy.  We couldn’t get on in New York.  At the very beginning, we’d been on in Manhattan.\n\n\nWeinraub:  You couldn’t get on in New York because of her—\n\nSchonfeld:  No, we couldn’t get on because they didn’t have room, Time Warner said.  Manhattan is all important to the advertising world.  If you’re not on in Manhattan, you’re dead.\n\tSo I got creative again and realized that Channel 50, which is a Newark channel, was carried on—and why did they need to be carried in Manhattan?  Their job is to serve New Jersey.  So I thought maybe I can arrange to get us the rights to Channel 50 from New Jersey.  This is the Food Network.  That kept me on the job for six more months, because after the thing blew up with the BBC thing, the partners were furious, and they should have been furious at the Journal, but not at me.  But anyway, I was going to have to pay—I had a five-year contract.  It didn’t matter.  They had to pay me because I was living within the contract and I got my percentage of the company and everything else, so I had nothing to lose.\n\nWeinraub:  Go back then to—\n\nSchonfeld:  But anyway, going back to this thing.  We had to get on in Manhattan and I reached out from New Jersey.  I’ve always known people there.  Christie Whitman was then the governor.  I knew their public station was a disaster, losing money all the time.  \nSo I called around and found the right guy to talk to, who was the chairman of the committee, not appointed by Whitman, the overseers of the channel, because you knew if you went to the channel, they’d say, “No, we have to have Manhattan.”  But a guy named Joe Montegro or Joe—I’ll have to look.  It doesn’t matter.  But in any event, he was a Republican backer.  He was a very nice man, decent, honest man.  I said, “Here’s what we have, Joe.  We’d like to get this.  You guys don’t really need it and you do need the money.”\n\nWeinraub:  You wanted to get that channel because it could broadcast into—\n\nSchonfeld:  In New York.  We were only buying the Manhattan rights.  So I spent three of four months arranging it.  First we had to go to the lawyers and prove that they had the right to sell them.  Dick Wiley, who had been head of the FCC, handled this for us and it \nwas clear we had the right to do it.  So I arranged the deal, which finally got us on in Manhattan.  They had to give a month’s notice.  They had to send a postcard to everybody saying, “A month’s notice, Channel 50.”  This is what Time Warner had to do for cable, “We’re changing Channel 50 from this to that,” and it was a legal requirement.  Now, we could have done it by inserting a notice into their mailing envelopes.  That would have cost us, like, oh, whatever, $30,000, or we could have done it by sending out \na postcard, which was then three cents or whatever, more than that.  Three cents, twenty, whatever it was, to 1,100,000 people, which would have cost $250,000.\n\nWeinraub:  You mean announcing that it was available via Channel 50.\n\n\nSchonfeld:  Yes, that Channel 50 was no longer going to carry this; it was going to carry that.  But they were so eager to end this thing with the partners, that they paid the extra $200,000 to send it out as a postcard.\n\tAnyway, but we got it on, I think, November first of ’95, or December first, maybe, of ’95, and that was enormously important in promoting the channel because then the foodies in New York and other people—enormously important for the Leach show.  If that had been on there when Robin Leach started and you could have had New Yorkers seeing themselves on the air, he could have gotten much better guests, much faster, much \nquicker.  So that was the last thing.  In many ways, it was about the third or fourth most important thing I did with the Food Network, which was just clearing Manhattan.\n\nWeinraub:  I guess another thing that you did, always with an eye to the cost, was the factory system for recording the shows that you—\n\nSchonfeld:  I wouldn’t call it a factory system.\n\nWeinraub:  But you used the same person, the same set over and over.  What I’m saying is sequentially—\n\nSchonfeld:  If we were going to do sixty-five shows, the chefs wanted to do them as fast as they could.  They weren’t going to do a show a day or two shows a day.  They weren’t going to be away from the store that long.  I think we did the most was with Emeril and that was seven shows a day, and he wanted to do eight because that would have gotten him back to New Orleans faster.\n\nWeinraub:  So it would all be set up so that he could record one after another.\n\nSchonfeld:  Yes.  Say if you did seven, that would be three and a half hours of programs over a ten-hour day because we had two ten-hour shifts every day for our crews, and that meant that the recipes had to be prepared.  We got great cooking people.  That was Sue Hoffman.  Found great people to handle our kitchen.  None of the chefs ever complained about the quality of the food we gave them.  We checked all their recipes.  They all had to be preapproved.\n\nWeinraub:  Preapproved, pretested?\n\nSchonfeld:  Pretested.  Pretested, I guess is the right word.  They want to be pretested and then made in our kitchens, but I was happy with that.  That was a really good thing to say.\n\nWeinraub:  Any of them with live audiences?\n\nSchonfeld:  Occasionally we did live audience, so that was another show that I did that I forgot that I bought from the BBC, which was ten bucks.  We had a battle of the chefs.  Pat produced that show and she’ll know when she comes back, where we had two chefs and each was given ten dollars to buy ingredients to make a meal and the audience had to decide which was better.  So with that we had a live audience for.  And we didn’t have enough room to do that in our studio and we’d have to rent studios outside to do that program.  Even when they started doing Emeril Live, they had to move out of the original headquarters and do it.  It was a setup for just what it was, kitchen shows and talk shows, but not audience shows.\n\nWeinraub:  As time went on, things were more or less moving on target in terms of the growth that you had anticipated or what?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, I would not have said yes to that.  I only really ran the place for a year \nand a half, of which only one year was real production because it took us half a year to just get into our new quarters.  So I would have liked to have moved forward faster with better shows.  We had good stuff in the pipeline.  We had Mario in the pipeline when I left.  We had Bobby Flay in the pipeline when I left.  I don’t want to downplay that either, but we were just reshuffling.  We kept the restaurant show on for quite a few years and finally they gave up on that show, and they learned something that I should have learned, was that repeats are wonderful on cable.  Even then, our best ratings we get on Saturday and Sunday mornings when women are at home to watch it, and Emeril was the star.  If we ran an Emeril marathon—\n\nWeinraub:  And those were repeats?\n\nSchonfeld:  They were all repeats, yes.  So that we didn’t need to do nearly as many shows as I did, 260 a year.  So you have one a day every weekday and then weekend on repeats.  People didn’t remember.  I don’t know whether you’re an old Law and Order fan or and NCIS fan, but those shows that repeat work and work and they’re making fortunes for their companies.  So it’s become a different medium and that’s only happened gradually, so I can’t kick myself too much for not realizing that we could have \nproduced less and repeated more and probably done better because we would have a \nwider variety of shows if we hadn’t had all these people working.  At the same time, Emeril would not have developed as quickly and become as strong as he was.  Mario wouldn’t have.  Bobby Flay wouldn’t have.\n\nWeinraub:  What was Bobby Flay’s program?  Because we haven’t talked about that.\n\nSchonfeld:  Again, that didn’t happen.  It was another show that was in the pipeline.  It was called Chillin’ and Grillin’ and Pat, again, produced that show.  That had Bobby Flay and a Philadelphia chef.\tPat, what was the name of the Philadelphia chef that was on with Bobby Flay?  Do you remember?  The show you did, Chillin’ and Grillin’.\n\nWeinraub:  That was a man or a woman?\n\nSchonfeld:  A man, and a very testosterone-full man, so there was—\n\nPat [O’Gorman]:  I can’t remember [unclear].\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, okay.  Well, if you can, let us know.\n\nWeinraub:  Well, we can look it up, yes.\n\nSchonfeld:  The testosterone was so high on that show as they competed with each other.  They were both macho guys.  He was much older than Bobby Flay.  He was the older tough guy and Bobby was the younger but also very male guy.  That, I think, was one of the things that I did learn, was that it helped us if the male chefs were male.  We did John Ash.  That was another show we did sixty-five of that I haven’t mentioned to you.  John is a wonderful chef.  I don’t know if you know.\n\nWeinraub:  Yes, I do.\n\nSchonfeld:  He’s a wonderful chef and I knew loads of women who really liked to cook, who thought that was one of our best shows.\n\nWeinraub:  Oh, the recipes are really terrific.\n\nSchonfeld:  But the audience—he didn’t have the—\n\nWeinraub: He was low key or—\n\nSchonfeld:  Yes, he was very low key and there wasn’t the testosterone.  I think I’ve said this to you, because I think this is one of the most important things that the Food Network contributed, was I believe that Julia Child and her programs made it possible for women, middle-class, upper-middle-class women to cook and be proud of it.  I believe that Emeril made it possible for macho guys to be able to admit they cook.  You didn’t have to be gay to be a good cook.  And it was those kind of guys, Mario also, who projected that and their shows were more successful than guys who were better cooks, who had better recipes.  In the end, in television you realize that, that the quality of the host is probably more important than the quality of the content.\n\nWeinraub:  So let’s go back to the BBC now and why you eventually left.\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, I’d been wanting to get back into the news business ever since CNN.  It’s something I feel entirely comfortable with, while I don’t pretend to be a Food Network person.  At the time we did that show, Food Network, we were living in this building, but in an apartment on the third floor, and we had taken the kitchen out of that apartment.  It was a small apartment.\n\nWeinraub:  You’d taken it out?\n\nSchonfeld:  Yes.\n\nWeinraub:  And why was that?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, Pat didn’t cook and we needed the room.  We thought it would be better as a large single room than half a kitchen and half a living room.\n\nWeinraub:  So you ate out or—\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, as Pat used to say grandly when we were down at the Des Artistes, “This is my kitchen.”  [laughter]  But no, we ate out or we—I think we had a hotplate and a coffee machine.\n\nWeinraub:  You were not an ideal audience for the Food Channel.\n\nSchonfeld:  No.  The channel itself, we could watch, but we weren’t foodies.  It was a very fun thing for us to do as television.\n\tSo anyway, going back to where we were, I really wanted to be back in news.  There were two guys, two brothers from the Midwest who wanted to do it.  I’d introduced \nthem to the BBC and we had made a deal with the BBC, and it was announced that I would do it and I would be the—\n\nWeinraub:  To do what?\n\nSchonfeld:  We’d do a twenty-four-hour-a-day BBC news channel and I would be the executive chairman.  Now, the executive chairman, you know, in England, they’re not executive chairmen.  That’s how I could fit it in on a fifty-day-a-week thing.  I could advise.  I could talk with—\n\nWeinraub:  And we should again say clearly your contract allowed you fifty days to do—\n\nSchonfeld:  Gave me the fifty days.\n\nWeinraub:  —fifty days to do—\n\nSchonfeld:  Private projects.\n\nWeinraub:  And this was a contract with the Providence Journal.\n\nSchonfeld:  Yes, the Journal and I had agreed originally that I would be a partner in any other channels they did.  They wanted to get out of that, and I didn’t want them to get out of it.  My lawyers finally worked out a deal where I could develop my own channels, but for no more than fifty days a year, so I had that right.  And then I was there.  I was developing the BBC and all of a sudden—\n\nWeinraub:  Were you in London or were you here?\n\nSchonfeld:  No, I was in here.  I had been to London the weeks before while the Food \n\n\n\n\nChannel was being done, but I don’t think I ever went to London after the Food Channel, except—oh yes, I was doing something else for the Food Channel.  I was trying to get us carried in England on SKYE, so I went over to England two or three times to negotiate with SKYE, but that didn’t work out.  I don’t think there was any follow-up after I left, \nand if there was ever a chance, I don’t know to this day whether SKYE has a food network on or not.  SKYE was—it’s a Murdock product and it’s very heavy into sports, but I’m sure they have enough room to do it.  But whether they’ve done it or not, I don’t know.\n\nWeinraub:  So what precipitated your actual leaving?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, when it was announced that I was doing the BBC thing, they came and said, “You’ve got to give that up or you’ve got to give this up.”\n\nWeinraub:  The Providence Journal Company people?\n\nSchonfeld:  Yes, they did.\n\nWeinraub:  Did you think you could do both at the same time?\n\nSchonfeld:  Oh, sure.  I mean, the fifty days a year could have even been on weekends if I really need this, and I was more than willing because, for me, the news thing was going to be very, very easy.  BBC was producing the programming except for four hours a night, which we would have done out of London.\n\nWeinraub:  And what did you do?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, I made up a whole schedule for them.  Those three or four hours would have been U.S. prime time, eight to eleven, eight to twelve.  Eight in New York is what time in London?  London is six hours later, so it’s in the middle of the night for them, \nwhich is why they were willing to do it for us.  It was our middle of the night.  It was their middle of the night, our prime time.  I was going to do a review of the day for three hours.  It was a review of the day’s news by our people in London, followed by an hour interview with an American and Brit and others about it, and then an hour on what’s going to be starting, what’s coming up tomorrow, and what we’re looking forward to.  It was talk-show kind of programming, but they had plenty of video of their own.  We didn’t have to staff anything.  We didn’t have to have any bureaus.  I think I had to have a bureau in Washington because they didn’t think theirs was enough, but that was all easy stuff because the BBC wouldn’t have wanted me to produce the individual program.  They had to control the content.  They were very firm on that, and I didn’t want to control it, but it would have been a joy to do and I think it would have been of considerable help to America to have had that kind of news coming in.  Even now, all of the BBC news has gotten worse.  I don’t know if you ever watch 5 at eight a.m.\n\nWeinraub:  No, not from five to eight.  [laughs]  I watch it later sometimes, BBC America.\n\nSchonfeld:  At seven o’clock at night and they have a show, but for the best morning news in America, you still get on the BBC, even if you watch from seven to eight.  It’s \nfar superior in coverage, though.  Anyway, but that was what it was and I chose to stay with the BBC, and then my partners couldn’t raise the money and they dropped out of the deal, so it was double heartbreak.  After promising and having all their own money and being all this rich, when they couldn’t get people to support them, they said they weren’t going to go ahead with the BBC.\n\nWeinraub:  So when, in fact, did you leave the Food Network?\n\nSchonfeld:  Oh, I guess about six months after—I told you that that New Jersey thing just kept me there longer and longer and then they couldn’t find anyone to replace me.  They brought in an interim guy and then they found Erica Gruen.  Erica was a great disappointment to me.  I had known her at Cablevision.  I thought she was very good.  But she didn’t understand money and she gave interviews to the Times that I wasn’t \npleased with, which were factually wrong and which the Times had to correct.  She even said that the Food Network was going to make money in her last year and I forced Scripps Howard, which then owned it at that point, to go to Merrill Lynch to bring out the offering and we tracked that statement because they were raising money.\n\tI’m sure you don’t know this law.  I learned this because of Ted Turner, that while you’re under prospectus, while you’re raising money, anything you say has got matter of \nfact and if you don’t accomplish it, all your investors can get their money back.  One of the deals I said Ted had two chances to raise money.  One of those deals was with Drexel Lambert, and after it was gone through and signed it, he wanted to get out.  And Bevan, the CFO, didn’t want him to get out of it, so I wouldn’t put him on our air.  But he went on Oprah, and he went on Oprah and said, “CNN is going to make money next year.”\n\tAnd Drexel Lambert just said, “We can’t bring out the issue now because you can’t guarantee that to us and we’re not going to—.”\n\nWeinraub:  So looking back on your years at the Food Network and what it accomplished, how do you see all that today?\n\nSchonfeld:  I’m very proud of what it has accomplished.  I wish some of the programs didn’t exist.  I’m not particularly fond of the Rachel Ray Show, which is their number one \nhit.  As a matter of fact, Joe Langhan—and I later backed Joe Langhan with a couple of other people in something that we called All Food.  It was on real networks, was one of the first internet video services, and we invented the twenty-minute meal, Joe did, for that, saying that housewives had to cook in twenty minutes.  He was very conscientious.  He made sure every meal could be cooked in twenty minutes and how you would stop at \na shopping market and you’d get the bag of this and a bag of that so you could cook in twenty minutes.  After we started that thing, then the Food Network picked up the Thirty Minute Meal with Rachel Ray.  That started her career.  It’s accomplished great things.  It’s pretty much—you’d know better than I—pretty much pure entertainment now.\n\tI didn’t mention that I did a wine show with—Jancis Robertson is the British expert and Frank Prial from the Times, and I brought in Imus’ wife to play the dumb blonde on the show.  Show didn’t work at all.  Jancis, you know, she does the Oxford Wine Dictionary or whatever, she was just too high [unclear].  And Prial, every man from Brooklyn, I wanted him to play that role.  He was just as high [unclear] about wanting to [unclear] us, so that didn’t work.\n\tWe were searching for what would really work for the audience, and it would have been great for me if I would have had more time to learn and I think I would have gotten better.  Whether I’d ever been as good as these people, I can’t say, because they’ve really \nfound an audience now.  It’s just become a terrific audience.  I think some of it is due to the programming, but some also is due to the change in the culture about food, and there, I think, the Food Network has made a major contribution of changing food culture and awareness.\n\nWeinraub:  Tell me how you see that.\n\nSchonfeld:  The idea that everybody cooks was not around when we started it.  We had to sell it with Everybody Eats, the Food Network, because everybody eats.  You couldn’t sell it because everybody cooks.  But gradually as people saw other people cook, just as Julia did, saw other people cook and the kinds of people that cook, everybody began to cook.  Some people who didn’t cook began to cook and others came out of the closet and said, “Yes, we cook and we take great pride in what we make,” and all that stuff.\n\tSo that I think basically we changed food from a somewhat prissy, dandified subject into a subject that everybody felt free to talk about, and we gave them a common frame of reference, the Food Network, so people could talk back and forth about what they saw on that network.  I think that was a fundamental change.  And here I’m only guessing, but at times like this of great stress, it’s a hell of a lot better to watch food programs than it is to watch the news shows.\n\tI write for [Ariana] Huffington now, and when I write for her, when I talk about this, it’s the idea that—I’ve written, I think, two pieces about the Food Network topping the news networks.  I stress the comfort factor and that people need it, and the yelling and the shouting at each other that all the three networks have fallen prey to, it’s the very opposite.  Food is as close to an opposite of the yelling and shouting as you can find.\n\nWeinraub:  And you think television viewers seek out the opposite to the frightening things they see on the news?\n\nSchonfeld:  Well, there was an old saying in broadcast television that viewers sought out the LOP, the least objectionable program.  They didn’t choose the best.  And I think food, in many ways, is the least objectionable program on television.  You never have to worry about what your children are going to see.  You don’t have to think there’s suddenly \ngoing to be bloody murder and violence on the screen, and you can at least kid yourself that you’re learning something.\n\tWhen I bought that show from the BBC, the—what was the name of that show, Pat, that you produced with the two chefs, gave them ten dollars each?  They gave five pounds to each of their chefs.  It was on BBC2.\n\nPat:  [unclear].\n\nSchonfeld:  No.  We had different chefs.  Remember we had the [unclear] chef from the West Point versus the chef from Annapolis.\n\nPat: That was with Suzy what’s her face.  That was at the [unclear].\n\nSchonfeld:  No.  Sometimes you did it out of there.  Sometimes at other places, right, because we went outside to do it.  But I’m just trying to remember the name of the show.\n\nSchonfeld:  We can check that out, but that was a popular show.  The success of that show, and it was very successful in England, was because they said women—they ran it from five to six on BBC 2, but women just finished doing their work for the day at five to six, and they felt entitled to sit down or watch something.  It was half an hour, but they felt they could learn something.  They could see, whether they ever bought, that they were doing their families a service because they could see what they could buy for five pounds for a meal, and so that they felt entitled.\n\tI think a lot of the food shows allow people to feel that they are learning something, that it does help them in their daily lives, and I think it’s enormously important in getting \na good and devoted audience, which the Food Network now has.  Even when we were doing the Food Network, in the year and a half, two years, we got over a million letters requesting recipes, and now their website is enormously successful, and I guess everybody recognizes very few of those recipes ever get made.  [laughter]\n\nWeinraub:  Would you have predicted the success of the Food Network?\n\nSchonfeld:  Yes, I mean it’s a .5 or .6, and I think if you’d see my five-year plan, you’d \nsee that it went from a .3 to a .5 or .6, or maybe even a .7, over that period of time.  It’s harder now because there are so many channels.\n\tOne of the things we did, which was revolutionary at the time, was we were the first digital channel.  We bought a transponder and we pioneered digital reception.  The great downside of digital reception was it ended almost all barriers.  Before then, there had only really been room for maybe fifty-four channels at about the peak, or sixty-four thirty, but all of a sudden with digital, there were room for hundreds of channels.  There were eighteen-channel system when we started, then thirty-six, then fifty-four, and you had to fight very hard.  With digital, hundreds ultimately.\n\tSo when we started it, we were forced to give away—this also put us over budget—we had to give away digital receivers to some stations because they didn’t have digital \nreceivers in some cable systems, but they only cost a few thousand dollars.  They weren’t that expensive and it was just the systems raping us for a few more bucks to do it.  But once they had those receivers, then they could receive any other digital things and you got the vast outbreak of digital networks all over.\n\nWeinraub:  Well, that really did open up a whole new world.  So maybe with, we’d better stop here.\n\nSchonfeld:  But that factor, I mean somebody else would have done it because I have a—is it upstairs or here, or maybe it’s in my office.  I have an award given me by Yews [phonetic] for being the first one to buy a digital transponder, which I think Belo [Broadcasting] still owns.  You know Belo bought the Food Network.  You’ve got the oral history.  Belo bought it from Providence Journal and then Scripps bought it from Belo.\n\tIf you’d like to hear that story, Belo—you know, the Texas newspaper and television company—didn’t know what to do with the station and they ultimately sold it to Scripps, which had already launched Home and Garden and had an idea of cable, in return for which Belo got the San Antonio—a network affiliate, whether ABC, CBS, NBC, I don’t know, which Scripps had owned.  Belo paid Scripps 75 million dollars.  So \nScripps got 75 million dollars and the Food Network and Belo got a local television station in San Antonio, and I won’t tell you the name of the guy who gave the fairness opinion to Belo on that deal, but that sure will tell you something about Wall Street, that anybody could give a [unclear] opinion.  Belo wanted to get rid of it.  They didn’t care, and I should have bought—well, that’s another story.  I could have bought it.  I could have and I was too dumb to—I’d agreed to the deal and then Dick Parsons called me and said, “Time Warner would like to buy it,” and I said I’d give him my word.\n\tI kick myself for this all the time.  I got into the meeting.  They wanted to change in \n\n\n\n\ntheir favor one of the terms of the deal they made, and I just thought it was a small change and what the hell.  But if I had thought about it twice, I would have said, “Forget it, guys.  We got a new buyer,” and we’d all have done better.  I’m not sure anybody would have done better but Time Warner.\n\tOh, I haven’t told you.  Time Warner turned us down with Tryg, even though he had been there.\n\nWeinraub:  It turned down the Food—\n\nSchonfeld:  The Food Network, yeah.  They could have owned 30 percent of it for 11 million dollars and their 15 million cable homes.\n\nWeinraub:  At the beginning?\n\nSchonfeld:  Yeah, before it started.  The people we went to first was Tryg.  I should have told you this because this is important, the negativity with which we were received.  They decided instead they would do an upscale shopping channel, which they did with—Spiegel catalogue is their partners and I’m told it cost them 100 million dollars—I don’t think they’d admit that—instead of getting 30 percent of the Food Network, which would be worth 600 or 700 million now, and they turned it down flat because people just didn’t believe that there could be a successful food network.\n\tWe had to fight Chuck Dolan because Chuck was working with Martha Stewart to start a food network, and with the muscle we got for the Tribune deal, we were able to keep them out because, again, it was the number of homes you had, that muscle.  But Dolan was smart.  He would have done it, but we went to other companies.  Comcast couldn’t—not Comcast.  Tryg had a friend.  They ultimately came in for a small piece, but they could have done the whole thing and they refused to do it.\n\tFood was just particularly—this is entirely a male-run industry at this time at the head of it, and people didn’t recognize that food could have this kind of an audience.  I would think at this point—I’ll check this for you if you want to call me at my office—\nthat of all the networks founded at that time, Food may be doing the best.  It certainly is one of the best.  It will depend, but I’ll look that up now.  The perennial winner is TBS, TNT, USA, but they were founded long before.  So if you call me, I’ll check over my books and take a look.\n\nWeinraub:  I’ll ask Erica to look at that.  Thank you very much for all of this.  This is really terrific.\n\nSchonfeld:  You’re more than welcome.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSchonfeld - 1 -  PAGE 54\n\n\n\n","description":"The Food Network has arguably had the greatest impact on the way Americans think about food. The network was launched in November 1993 as TVFN with 6.8 million cable subscribers.

In May 2010, Scripps initiated a second 24-hour network of food programming called The Cooking Channel.\r\n\r\nIt was Reese Schonfeld who got the Food Network going, developing the concept with a group put together by the Providence Journal Company's president Trygve Myhren.

It can be particularly difficult to get answers to questions about agricultural economics or the American food system. Yet Gus Schumacher, the only farmer in the Harvard class of 1961, has always considered educating the public (and the U.S. Congress) an essential and enjoyable part of his role.\r\n\r\nAs Commissioner of Agriculture of Massachusetts, Administrator of the Foreign Agriculture Service, and then Undersecretary of the Farm and Foreign Agriculture Service at the USDA in the Clinton administration, Schumacher consistently found ways to spread the word. He educated reporters; regularly spoke on the farm radio network; facilitated conversations between journalists, political officials, farmers, and agricultural economists; and was always available to explain a new law or regulation or Farm Bill.\r\n\r\nSince he left government in 2007, Schumacher has continued that pattern as a consultant. Assisting and enabling new farmers - immigrants, women, young people - is one of his passions. Currently Schumacher is also the president of Wholesome Wave, a Connecticut-based charitable foundation that has been particularly active in finding ways to help the needy purchase nutritionally-rich produce at farmers markets at discount rates.TTT\n\nInterviewee:  Gus Schumacher\t\t\t\t\t\t   Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t      New York City\n\nDate:  June 4, 2009\n\nQ:  It’s June 4.  This is Judith Weinraub, up here with Gus Schumacher and we’re about to begin our first interview.\nGood afternoon.  Why don’t we start by your telling me something about, first of all, when and where you were born and what your family life was like and where you grew up, anywhere you want to.\n\nSchumacher:  My father met my mother skiing in New Hampshire in 1936 or ’35 when he was farming in Flushing, New York.  My mother was the manager of the Harvard Law Review and the secretary for Felix Frankfurter at the Harvard Law School.  When they met, there was an agreement that if they were to get married, my father would move from Flushing in Queens to New England and farm in New England, particularly outside of Boston, and then live in the city and reverse commute.  So he lived in Brookline, parked his pickup in the city, and then drove out to Lincoln and farmed in Lincoln, Massachusetts.\n\tThey got married in 1938 and I was born in 1939.  My mother started having a number of children.  She married very late.  She was thirty-nine when she got married, so she had four kids, the last born in 1946.\nThen they decided that reverse commuting with four kids and an apartment near Boston didn’t quite make sense, so they rented a home in Lincoln in 1938, ’39 and ’40 and then bought a farm in Lexington, Mass., in 1940, the old Ballard farm, which was a terrific farm.  It was an interesting purchase because my Dad came from a basically three-generation horticultural family, which we can get into in a little while, here in Manhattan and then Queens.  He had seven brothers and two sisters, all farmed in Queens.  When the people bought farms back in the thirties, the farm was bought with all the crops and all of the livestock in situ.  So in April 1940 when he bought the Lexington farm where I grew up, basically, Mr. Ballard and his wife moved to retirement in New Hampshire, but all the crops were planted, all the animals were there, all the pigs, the poultry, the horses.  There were no cows, and there were seventeen Polish men living in the back of the house.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.  You mean farm workers?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.  They had come from Poland in the thirties during the Depression and they lived in the back of the home.  My mother had two stoves, wooden stoves, coal stoves, and a special woman to help cook.\n\nQ:  I should hope so.  [laughs]\n\nSchumacher:  So my mother cooked for about twenty people three times a day with the help of a cook that came with the farm.\n\tThen the war started and, of course, most of the men were drafted and went on to the war, so there were only two men left that I really remember, maybe a little older, too old to go to the war, and they lived with us in the farm.  There was a dormitory in the back of the house, in one of these New England farmhouses.  We lived in the front and the men lived in the back.  That was fascinating.\n\nQ:  What was the community like?\n\nSchumacher:  It was a suburban community.  It was basically eight miles from Boston, ten miles, Lexington, Mass., where the shot was heard round the world, where the Minutemen came.  In fact, where the British soldiers went from Charlestown to Lexington and from Lexington to Concord, they went right through my father’s farm, where the stone wall—so as kids, we’d get our BB guns out and behind the stone walls and play “Let’s shoot Redcoats.”\n\nQ:  A little reenactment there.\n\nSchumacher:  A little reenactment from the kids.  We’d pretend we’d shoot Redcoats.\n\nQ:  Had your mother ever lived on a farm before?\n\nSchumacher:  No.  No, she graduated from Boston University.  My other grandfather, her father and mother, were Irish immigrants, first generation, and she wanted to become a lawyer, but women were not allowed into the law schools back in the twenties.  It was not a permitted entry to law.  So she loved law and she got a job as the personal assistant to Felix Frankfurter, and she worked there for fifteen years.  My baby cup, actually, is from Felix Frankfurter, and I visited him when he was still alive in Washington in the early sixties.  My mother would take us down there to visit.\n\tSo this was kind of a new thing for her from being a prominent administrative assistant manager of his affairs and manager of the Harvard Law Review, where she got to know all of the major people who worked on the New Deal.  She never admitted it, but I think she dated Alger Hiss.  She knew Phil Graham when he went to law school.  She knew Tommy Corcoran.  So there were great discussions at the dinner table in the fifties between my father, who’s Republican, my mother, who’s Democrat, was Hiss a communist or not, and Whittaker Chambers versus Alger Hiss.  I remember when I was nine, ten, twelve years old, there was vibrant discussion, and my father saying, “He’s a commie,” and my mother saying, “No, I knew him.  He’s not a commie.  He couldn’t be a commie.  He’s a very nice man.”  “You may have known him, but he was a commie.”  So there was a lot of discussion on the New Deal over the kitchen table.\n\nQ:  So where did they meet, actually?\n\nSchumacher:  They met skiing in a ski resort up in New Hampshire, because back in the twenties and thirties, farming in New York City, you were profitable.  My grandfather, my great-grandfather and my uncles were, frankly, prosperous, and they did very, very well.  When you grew vegetables year-round in Manhattan and Flushing in the late nineteenth century and up until about 1955, you were prosperous.  You made more than a good living growing leeks and parsnips.  We can come back to that in a minute.\n\nQ:  Do you have any visual knowledge of or photographs of the Manhattan farm?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.  The original Manhattan farm, my mother’s side was Irish immigrant, and my father’s side, my great-grandfather came from Germany.  His name was John Schumacher.  He was on the wrong side of the 1848 social revolution in Germany, so he thought he’d get out of there before he got nixed.  So he came to New York in 1848, ’49, and heard about something called the Gold Rush.  So somehow he got to California, did some mining and found a little bit of gold, not much but a little, managed to get it back to Manhattan, where he rented a farm at 72nd and Broadway in Manhattan in 1855, and then farmed there, I guess from what we can figure, from 1860 to 1886, when 72nd Street was cut through.\n\tRemember, back in the nineteenth century, New York was really Wall Street, the Seaport area.  That’s why Central Park, they didn’t take any houses down; that was all farms.  So when the Dakota was built in the 1880s, 1890s, of course, they called it the Dakota because it was like in North Dakota; not many lived there.  I mean, no one was living uptown.  It was very unusual for an apartment building to be built at 72nd or 73rd Street in the West Side, because nobody lived there except farmers.  So then they cut 72nd Street through in 1888.\n\nQ:  Cut it through to the river?\n\nSchumacher:  To the river from Broadway or whatever, and right through my grandfather’s house.\n\nQ:  So do you have pictures of that house?\n\nSchumacher:  Oh yes.\n\nQ:  What did it look like?\n\nSchumacher:  Not a fancy house, basically wooden boards and a roof, very, very simple.  It wasn’t a shack.  It wasn’t a cottage.  It was sort of kind of like when you build something in Montana in 1890.  I have pictures of my grandfather, my great-grandfather and grandmother, sitting in front of the farm, plus some of the pictures of the farm.  In fact, it was written up in the New York Times when they talked about my grandfather in 1934.  They talked about farming on 72nd and Broadway, and the interviewed my grandfather on what it was like. He said it was great fun because he could sit on the side of Broadway and watch all the great events, including the funeral for Grant.  He sat and watched Grant’s funeral as a boy when he then was entombed at Grant’s tomb.\n\nQ:  As it went up Broadway.\n\nSchumacher:  As it went up Broadway, he sat out front on this curb and watched the cortège go by for Grant going to Grant’s tomb.  He put in his diaries, “Watched Brooklyn Bridge being built.”  We’ll come back to why the Brooklyn Bridge was very important for farming in a minute.\n\nQ:  Primarily they were farming root vegetables?\n\nSchumacher:  Basically Northern European crops, so, root vegetables, parsnips, carrots, turnips, cabbage, leeks, and what we’ll come back to is soup greens.  They did not farm what we call Italian crops.  Those are neighbors who grew peppers and tomatoes and the warm season crops.  But they were traditional cool season crops, year-round, but more of a northern German, Polish-type crops than Italian or southern French crops.\n\nQ:  And the leeks you mentioned?\n\nSchumacher:  Lots of leeks, lots of parsnips, onions, cabbage, potatoes, tiny bit of sweet corn.  As we said earlier, he kept a diary from about 1890 to the day he died in 1955, daily, on farming in New York, where he recorded the weather, the crops he planted, the crops he harvested, who he sold them to, which farmers’ market he went to, and then who visited or who he visited and who dropped by, and then any illnesses and deaths in the family were recorded.  We have all the diaries, so a complete record of Manhattan and Queens farming for nearly sixty years.\n\nQ:  When did he move to Queens?\n\nSchumacher:  1888, 1890.  When the 72nd Street was cut through, they originally moved from 72nd and Broadway to Flushing, near LaGuardia Airport on Hempstead Pike, and bought a sixty-acre farm in Queens and farmed there from about 1890 to about 1935.\nThen the subways went through, and Flushing became quite urban or peri-urban, and they were pressured by all the housing developments, so he sold the farm for house lots and moved to New Hyde Park, which was about eight miles further east, and bought the old Vanderbilt place.  Vanderbilt had an estate which had a farm that went with it, and so he bought that farm, and his sons bought farms nearby in New Hyde Park.  So there were three or four farms of about eight or ten acres in that region where New Yorkers, many of my Jewish friends, were born in Long Island Jewish Hospital, and he donated the land for that hospital to be built on his farm in about 1955.  So you drive through the road, Schumacher Road, to get to Long Island Jewish Hospital.  So some of my younger friends, when I was working in Washington, were actually born there, and their mothers drove over my grandfather’s farm to get to the hospital to be born.  Kind of fun.\n\nQ:  So your parents married in—\n\nSchumacher:  ’38.\n\nQ:  —’38, and you were born in ’39, but you were born up there.\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So had they been living in Massachusetts for—well, they must—no, they moved.\n\nSchumacher:  They moved.\n\nQ:  They moved immediately to—\n\nSchumacher:  When they got married, my mother said, “You want to marry me, you come to Boston.  You farm anywhere you want outside of Boston, but I’m not moving to New York.  Your choice.  We get married, move to Boston, we live in the Brookline, you reverse commute,” and then eventually when all the kids came, they had to move out to Lincoln and Lexington, where basically I was raised.\n\nQ:  You have siblings.\n\nSchumacher:  Yes, a brother and two sisters.\n\nQ:  Where did you fit in?\n\nSchumacher:  I was the oldest.\n\nQ:  How relevant was farm life to your life?\n\nSchumacher:  Oh, it was pretty crucial.  We grew up, as I said earlier, with Polish men living in the back of the house, and then when they went to the war, we had two Polish men left, and then he would pick up Italian women workers in Waltham, who were also immigrants.  So then we had eventually Puerto Ricans coming up from Puerto Rico, so it was kind of a very integrated community, sort of a micro community of our family, all the neighbors and friends.  There were farms up and down our street, maybe six farms.  So we were farming a micro area of Lexington, plus the workers.  My dad was the biggest operator in the area, so he must have had twenty, twenty-five workers every day, and during the war, we had German prisoners who were from Rommel’s North African army, were captured in ’43, brought to Fort Devens, so at that point we had forty or fifty.\n\nQ:  Where is Fort Devens?\n\nSchumacher:  About twenty miles west of Lexington in Ayer, Mass., and they were imprisoned there.  But the regular army workers had to work.  The officers didn’t have to work.  During the war, we had to ramp up production so we had a lot of workers on the farm.\n\nQ:  You had some of the prisoners working on the farm?\n\nSchumacher:  Thirty prisoners every day, plus about eight Italians and about four Polish and then eventually Puerto Ricans, so it was sort of a U.N. of—\n\nQ:  Not a bad way to spend the war, actually.\n\nSchumacher:  I remember when I was about five or six years old, my mother was not the greatest cook.  The Irish cared more about what they said, not what they ate, and so cooking was not her specialty.  But then the Italians would bring in these new and interesting foods for lunch, so my brother and I would always skip out lunch and go out and have lunch with the Italian women and have things like hoagies, and special really salami and provolone and just delicious sandwiches, whereas back home I got egg and beans.  So the heck with that.  We’d go to go to the barn and have a decent lunch with the Italian women workers.\n\nQ:  That’s funny.  How did your schooling fit into all of this?\n\nSchumacher:  Just public school right to Lexington High School, but they were excellent schools.   But I remember in 1950 there were Italian men started coming in to work, a few.  I don’t remember them that well, but about two months ago [Sept. 2009] someone looked me up on the internet from California and said, “I think my father worked for your father,” and I said, “How do you know?”  “Because he signed your father’s name, signed his Social Security application,” which we have a copy of, and he scanned the Social Security application and sent the application to us, and I identified it was my father’s original signature.  Then he sent the picture of his father, and I found a picture of his father working on the farm.  So he had a picture of his father and his grandfather, his father and mother, and the man, who was now my age, sixty, and his son and grandson.  So I was able to identify his father from pictures we had taken on our farm, and I sent them, too.  Kind of a déjà vu from the fifties.  Again, this richness of the ethnic immigrants, but they weren’t housed in camps like they are in California.  They lived right with the families, and we cooked and ate together over that period of time.  Fascinating.\n\nQ:  So would you go to school at like normal school hours?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes, take the bus in.\n\nQ:  And did you do farm work before and after school?\n\nSchumacher:  No, I had to go take care of the animals before school, and we had sheep and poultry and a horse.  So my job, my brother and I had to look after the chickens and feed the sheep and brush the horse.  Then we had an egg route, so we had to take our eggs to the neighbors and sell eggs, make money after school.  Then I had a trap line.  I was a trapper, and I would go out and get muskrat and mink after school in the wintertime and then skin them and sell them to Sears, Roebuck.\n\nQ:  My lord.  Wow.  How did you have time for homework?\n\nSchumacher:  Just do it after six o’clock.  It gets dark in New England in the wintertime, five, five-thirty.  The bus would drop you off at two-thirty, three o’clock, so you had time to do your egg route and then check the trap lines.\n\nQ:  So you didn’t have to shoot the mink?\n\nSchumacher:  Oh yes.\n\nQ:  Oh, you did?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.\n\nQ:  The trap lines weren’t enough to kill them?\n\nSchumacher:  Well, no.  You’d bring your .22.  You know, people don’t have guns these days, but we had guns.  At eight, nine, ten years old, we had .22s.  During the wintertime we’d go trapping, and then in the summertime, the woodchucks would eat the lettuce, so my father would give me a buck for every woodchuck I shot.  So I got a telescopic sight and I’d sit up on the hill, and I’d watch the woodchucks pop up and knock them off and then bury them in the hole, and then bring the tails back and get my dad to give me a buck.\n\nQ:  You mean the tails were all they were interested in?\n\nSchumacher:  No.  You know, you wouldn’t haul a dead woodchuck back to the house, because the dogs would then tear it up.  You’d just cut the tail off, so you have evidence you actually shot it, and then throw the woodchuck back in the hole and bury it up.\n\nQ:  But, meanwhile, you were ridding the land of critters.\n\nSchumacher:  Varmints that were eating our lettuces and crops.  They could do a real job on the cabbage and lettuce.  You want to knock them off.\n\nQ:  What kinds of things were you studying in school at that point?\n\nSchumacher:  Just regular high school, you know, just get through high school, the normal high school English, geometry and algebra, Latin, the usual stuff.\n\nQ:  How did you envision your future?\n\nSchumacher:  Well, my brother and I, being on the farm, back then in the fifties everybody was a jock, and so my brother was a great football player and I was a runner, so we all applied to college and got in.  I guess I was the only farmer’s son to be let into Harvard back in 1957.  I guess I was called diversity then.\n\nQ:  But you’ve told me it had something to do with your having saved money from the gourds you sold.  Could you tell me a story about that?\n\nSchumacher:  Well, actually, it’s interesting being a public school kid, you have your whiffle, your white bucks, your sport coat, you’re going for interviewing, and I remember the man very well, Peter Briggs, who become a friend subsequently, who was the interviewer.  Mostly the kids going to Harvard then were prep school kids, well-off families from prep schools.  So not many farmers’ sons were.  In fact, I was the only one that was considered and got in.\n\nQ:  In your year?\n\nSchumacher:  As far as I can tell, I was the only farmer’s son that was in my class of seven hundred, and he told me later on—I remember the interview very well.  He had a tradition of asking the interviewers what you did last weekend, so he asked what did I do last weekend.  And I said, “Well, I picked gourds.”  He said what the heck were gourds?  I explained that gourds were ornamental gourds that you picked, shellacked, and sold to flower shops for putting on fall Thanksgiving tables, and that my father gave me a half an acre of land and he said, “Grow gourds.”  I wanted to grow gourds.  My brother and I grew these gourds, and we picked them, harvested them, shellacked them, and sold them, and then we exhibited them at the local horticultural hall.\n\tSo Briggs asked me this.  He said, “All right, Schumacher, gourds, okay.  You’ve explained what these things are.  All right.  Do you make any money?”\n\tI said, “Yeah.  What’s the tuition here?”\n\tHe said, “Well—,” he told me.”\n\tI said, “I can pay my own way.”\n\tHe said, “Really?”\n\tI said, “Yeah, made some money, put it in a savings account.”  Almost pay my own way if I lived at home.\n\tThen he leaned back, and I remember so well, he said, “No, Schumacher, this is Harvard.  You grow gourds well?”\n\tI said, “Well, two weeks ago I won the first prize of the Horticultural Hall for the adult gourd category.”\n\tHe said, “You’re kidding me.”\n\tI said, “No.”\n\tHe said, “Do you have evidence?”\n\tI brought in the little sticker, which I still have, from the Hort Society of 1956, ’57, whatever, first prize, American Gourd Society, Horticultural Hall of Boston, which is kind of funny.\n\tDave Souter was a classmate of mine.  He had lunch at the Supreme Court a few years ago, and Pete Briggs regaled us with—he remembered those stories and said the same thing about Souter.  Apparently, he asked the same question of Souter, “What did you do last weekend?”\n\t“Well, I preached at the local congregational church.”\n\tHe said, “You did what?  You’re sixteen years old.”\n\t“Well, the minister died six months ago.  We’re having trouble getting a new one, I’m a fill-in.”  Kind of interesting way of interviewing students, “What did you do last weekend?” kind of thing.  Anyway, that was kind of funny.\n\nQ:  What were your expectations when you went to Harvard?  Did you see your life in any particular direction?\n\nSchumacher:  No.  I was an economics major.  I mainly was interested in sports.  I did cross country, indoor and outdoor track, four years in a row, and that was my main objective, being a runner.  We actually qualified for the Olympic trials in 1960, so some of us went out to that, and I went and didn’t do that well, but we ran a pretty good time.  But it was fun to try out.  We qualified for the pre-trials.  That was fun.\n\tThen I had no idea what I wanted to do.  I thought I’d go to the Cornell Hotel School and be a hotelier in the Hilton Hotel in Caracas, Venezuela, for a while.  I don’t know why.  So I decided I’d better get some more education, so I looked at the options of going one year to Stanford, and for the same price I could go two years to the London School of Economics.  So I wrote to London and said, “Could I come for two years?” and they said, “Sure.  Fifty pounds a term.”  So I figured I’d have money left over I finished graduate school, so I had no debt when I finished two years of graduate school.\n\nQ:  And the money was from?\n\nSchumacher:  I just had money left over.  Of course, back then you could actually earn your way through college.  I had a little bit of money in savings, so I had money left over from my savings and working during summers.  Could never do that now, but tuition then $750 a year.  Now it’s $30,000 a year.  I could earn half my tuition, or more than half my tuition, during the summer.  You worked jobs during the winter, and you basically, with a little bit of savings and a little scholarship, you had no debt.  So I had no debt when I finished graduate school.\n\nQ:  Were your parents unhappy about the prospect of your not returning to the farm?\n\nSchumacher:  No.  My brother became a landscape contractor and lived on the farm, so he used all my dad’s equipment.  Then my brother eventually bought his own farm and did very well at that.  So my two sisters, one’s a schoolteacher.  Both involve teaching.  So they were, “Whatever you want to do.”\n\nQ:  Tell me what the years at LSE were like and what kinds of things you were doing there.\n\nSchumacher:  Basically studying economics and running.  You could be semi-professional athlete in Europe, whereas if you were in America, you did your four years, and then they were finished.  But in Europe there was a club system, so I could play basketball and run track for the University of London and LSE, and so I spent two years running around Europe.  It’s great fun.\n\nQ:  Two years meaning during or after?\n\nSchumacher:  During the time I was at University of London, LSE, just basically ran every track meet I could find, every basketball game I could run up, and then the big one was the University of London against the Hungarian ex-Olympic team in 1962 for the national championship of England, and they’d beat us by 20 points.  They were very good.  It was fun.\n\nQ:  Did you have any experience with British farms while you were there?\n\nSchumacher:  No.  I lived in downtown central London.  The only time I visited farms was running through them because we had winter cross country in the middle of winter.  So you’d run through these mud fields on these farms.  I never actually visited.  I don’t recall visiting any farms, except once when I visited my mother’s relatives in Ireland who were still farming, for Christmas, and we visited their farms in Christmas of 1961.\n\nQ:  So how did you see your future?\n\nSchumacher:  Just sort of accidental, I mean, in the sense that when I went to the London School of Economics, my tutor was Lord Robbins, who was one of the founders of the World Bank.  So he asked me, “What do you want to do with your life?” and I said, well, I hadn’t really thought about it.\n\tWhen Jack Kennedy was elected, I thought I’d like to go back and work for the Kennedy administration, so I studied trade and agricultural economics at LSE and also at Harvard and said, well, why don’t I look at trade negotiations on agriculture, and got myself a job as a trade analyst at the Tariff Commission.  But then Lord Robbins said, “Why don’t you go work at the World Bank?”\n\tAnd I said, “I didn’t know anybody there.”  So we figured out to get an internship.  So I got myself a summer internship for fifteen bucks a day, and at the end of the summer, the two people that my boss—there were three of us working for this both, named Albert Waterston, and two of the people left, and Albert said, “Would you want to stay on and help me?”  Because his two staffers, Cyril Martin and Fritz Steuber, were leaving.\n\tI said, “Well, I’m twenty-three.  That’s a bit young, and they don’t normally take people at twenty-three.”\n\tHe said, “Well, why not?”  So I guess I was at some point—he said, “Why don’t you become a junior professional and quit the US Tariff Commission and work for me?”\n\tI said, “How am I going to do that?”\n\tHe said, “Well, call up the personnel department.”  And the personnel department said no.  I don’t have any fancy degrees.  I’m twenty-three.  And Albert Waterston said, “But I want this kid.”\n\tSo I was apparently the youngest person ever to be hired by the World Bank in 1963, fifteen bucks a day.  That’s all right.  You could live on that then in 1963.\n\nQ:  What did you do?\n\nSchumacher:  Initially working on development economics, and then in 1966 that became the big change.  I told Albert I’d like to work on agriculture, and he counseled me against it.  He said, “No, agriculture’s a dead end, and no one’s working on agriculture.  It’s boring.  You’ve got to work on fancy stuff like econometrics.”\n\tI said, “No, I’m going to work in agriculture.”\nSo I got myself a job working as a project officer on agriculture in the evolving Agriculture Department at the Bank.\n\tThen in 1968, McNamara joined the bank, and that changed everything.  McNamara said, “We cannot continue the way the Bank has been run.  We need to work with small farmers worldwide, and I want 40 percent of the lending to be for agriculture in 1968.”  He gave a famous speech in Nairobi, and that became huge.\n\tI happened to be very well positioned, having been there four or five years, and so I started leading missions on agriculture in 1968, ’69 and ’70 because they were just trying to build up their staff.  So I guess I was the youngest mission chief ever for the bank, at the age of twenty-seven, leading missions to Uruguay on livestock.  It was fun.  That was really fun, because I went all over the world doing agricultural projects for the Bank in ’68 to ’78.  It was fun.\n\nQ:  Do you know why McNamara was interested in that in particular?\n\nSchumacher:  Call him up.  I have his number.  You can just call him up and ask him.  He’s still alive.  He just looked at the numbers.  He was a very smart man, and he looked at the numbers and said that 90 percent at that time of people in the developing countries worked in farming, and building steel mills wasn’t going to exactly help Africa, Brazil, and India to recover, to grow.  So he said, “I want 40 percent and I want that to be working on the poorest farmer.”  So that was a great chance, and we really built up the agriculture group at the Bank very rapidly, and we achieved those targets.\n\nQ:  What countries were you going to?\n\nSchumacher:  Greece, which was a very poor country in the mid-sixties, and then eastern Africa.  Greece, Guyana, Mauritius, Kenya, Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania and then heavily involved in Latin America, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, and then later on in China and then the nineties in Eastern Europe.  It was fun.\n\nQ:  How did your own farming background inform this work?\n\nSchumacher:  Well, one thing, I could drive a tractor.  That you grew up, if you have three generations of farmers, you kind of have a flavor of the seasonality, the cropping, the irrigation, the mechanical side, the marketing, the packaging.  From the age of infant until I was twenty-one, you’re on the farm.  You were working the farm.  You were driving the tractors.  You were feeding the animals, all that kind of stuff.  So, imbedded in your sort of being is what the rhythms of the seasons, rhythms of the agriculture, rhythms of the difficulties, too.  You know, my father, there were some tough times and things weren’t going that well.  You understand the cycles of agriculture, the cycles of weather, the cycles of bad policy.\n\nQ:  Bad farm policy?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.  For example, most of the commercial agriculture in the East was wiped out when the big subsidies for irrigation in California went in.\n\nQ:  Explain that.\n\nSchumacher:  Well, they put in basically free water for California in 1950s, so you then had subsidized water, huge numbers of [unclear] immigrants [unclear], and then Eisenhower built the interstate highway system, so you could land a trailer load of carrots into Boston for half the price that farmers in New England could grow carrots and lettuce, so that basically most of those farmers went out of business. Dad stopped farming in the mid-sixties.  You couldn’t make a living if you sold wholesale.  If you sold retail, the number of farmers then in New England switched to roadside stands in the fifties and sixties, and they’ve prospered, but selling to commercially wholesale, very difficult.  Most of those farmers went out of business.  All your major vegetables, some exceptions, went out of business.  Your apples stayed a little bit in.  So, in Massachusetts in 1950, maybe you had 12,000 farms.  By 1974, they dropped to 4500 in Massachusetts.  So you lost more than half your farms in a period of ten, twelve years.\n\tThen it turned around.  In 1975, Dukakis was elected and brought a Commissioner in, Freddie Winthrop, and he started a whole range of programs, Farmland Protection, direct marketing, “Mass Grown and Fresher.” \n\nQ:  Direct marketing meaning roadside?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes, farmers’ markets, roadside stands.  It was called Massachusetts Fresh and Grown and Fred Winthrop went on TV, said, “Let’s buy local.”  Dukakis and Freddie Winthrop started that nationally.  They started the Farmland Protection Program.  They started the local roadside stands.  They started embryonic farmers’ markets.\n\tMy brother was landscaping and he said, “This is pretty interesting,” so he went and bought another farm, bought a 200-acre farm, and then did all direct marketing.  He wouldn’t sell any wholesale from 1976 till-mid eighties, all retail, and that’s when I got really interested, when I was at the Bank.  I used to fly up and help him on the weekends.\n\nQ:  I was wondering about that.  I was trying to fit in the times that I knew you worked on the farm.\n\nSchumacher:  Because then they had something called New York Air, and you could get $49 each way from National Airport to Logan, and you got a cheap $30 rented car.  So for 150 bucks, I could fly up on weekends.  John would load the truck with the stuff in the back on Friday night, and I’d then take the truck in at five o’clock in the morning to the farmers’ markets in downtown Boston on the weekends.\n\tSo he would have pick-your-own and the roadside stand, and then I’d do the direct marketing on weekends during the summer and fall.  I was making as much money selling in the farmers’ market in Dorchester as he was selling in the roadside stand that day.  So we’d sit around his living room with all the cash, and that was kind of fun.  But at that point, 1980, is when things really became really interesting, because I was selling in Dorchester, and it’s a poor neighborhood.\n\nQ:  In the farmers’ market there?\n\nSchumacher:  Fields Corner Farmers Market in Dorchester was first of the new ones.  My brother had a terrific orchard of Bosc pears.  He had the largest Bosc pear orchard in New England, ten acres.  These are very high value.  I mean, Bosc pears are not like Barletts.  These are the Cadillac of pears.  I brought in ten bushels and we sold most of them, but one of the boxes was bad, and as I took the box back to the truck, it didn’t sell, it fell apart, wooden box, you know, and all the pears went into the gutter.  I remember it so well.  I thought, oh, darn, that’s $40 worth of pears.  I have to pick a shovel and throw them in the garbage.\n\tSo I went to get a box around the front of the truck, and when I came back, there was an Irish-American woman who looked to be late thirties with two young boys—it looked to me they were six, eight, nine, ten years of age—picking the pears out of the gutter.  I said, “Wait a minute.  What’s this about?”  She thought I was going to arrest her.  “No, no, no.  These are damaged pears.  Why are you taking them out of the gutter?”\n\tShe said, “You’re not going to arrest me?”\n\tI said, “No, no.”  We used to have them in pecks.  You know what a peck is.  So I gave her a peck of apples, maybe pears, maybe six pounds or so, and I said, “Here, take these.  They’re better pears and some apples.  But why are you in the gutter on your knees picking pears out of the gutter?  That’s awful.”\n\tShe said, “Well, my husband left me six months ago.  I’m on food stamps, and they don’t provide enough for fruit and vegetables.  You just buy calories.”  She was a little overweight and didn’t look good.  She didn’t have good color.  She wasn’t unhealthy, but she wasn’t eating right, certainly.  The boys looked okay.  So I gave her the pears.  But I remembered that.\n\nQ:  How old were you when that happened?\n\nSchumacher:  Forty.  Then in 1984, my father called me up and said, “Guess what?  Freddie resigned the Commissionership.”  Fred Winthrop was the man who had really started this local food movement and local agriculture, under Dukakis.  Dukakis was very pro-agriculture and gave Freddie a fair bit of money to buy farmland, protect farmland, do direct marketing, start some new farmers’ markets, foster the basically “Buy Local, Buy Fresh,” called “Mass Grown in Fresh Air”, and he was on TV a lot.  There were these ads.  You could then do public service ads, and back then they put these public service ads on the news.  So Freddie was on the news a lot promoting Massachusetts agriculture.\n\nQ:  He was the Commissioner of Agriculture at that point?\n\nSchumacher:  He was Commissioner of Agriculture, a great leader.  So he resigned, and my dad said, “You know, he’s resigned.  Your mother has passed away and you’re single, so come on up.”\n\tI said, “Well, how do I get the job?”\n\tHe said, “Well, call them up.”\n\nQ:  Where were you?\n\nSchumacher:  World Bank.\n\nQ:  Still?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.  World Bank.  So I applied for the job, and to my amazement, was interviewed and got the job in 1985.  So I took a leave of absence from the Bank.  I thought I’d leave for two years and left for seven and had a great time as Commissioner of Agriculture.\n\tFreddie really laid a good base.  Dukakis was the Governor and then ran for president and the times were prosperous, so we had a fair bit of money in the state, so we had a good budget.  So I was able to take Freddie’s program of Farmland Protection and double it.  We started the whole direct marketing, expansion of farmers’ markets, really expanded money on fresh foods.  Visited USDA [the United States Department of Agriculture] in Washington.  We figured out how to get some money out of the federal government and then leveraged that money to hand out for improved marketing.\n\nQ:  How did you do that?\n\nSchumacher:  Just asked for it.\n\nQ:  I see.  [laughs]\n\nSchumacher:  I mean, being my mother’s Irish and me being half Irish.\n\nQ:  You asked the USDA?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.  Just go down and worked congressmen.  There’s Congressman Chet Atkins.  Just if you’re born in Boston, you’re a natural, you know how to ask for it, you know, Teddy Kennedy, Billy Bulser.  In a very polite way, you just go down and figure out how to get it and bring it back.  Good fun.\n\tBut at that point I remembered the woman who was in the gutter, picking pears, and I said to Hugh Joseph at Tufts Nutrition School, “There’s got to be a better way.  Why can’t vulnerable women and children get access to fresh fruits and vegetables?  How do we figure this out?  We have a bit of money.”\n\tHugh said, “Well, there’s something called the Women, Infants, and Children’s Program.”  So we sat around Tufts drinking a few beers and put together this program called the WIC, Women, Infants, and Children’s Fruit and Vegetable Voucher Program.  And I asked Dukakis—I still have the original memo.  I sent Dukakis a memo, and he sent back notes, “If you can find ten grand from a foundation, I’ll give you seven grand from the budget,” or however that worked out.\n\tSo I rang up one of my mother’s friends from Boston University.  Her son was a major philanthropist in Oregon.  I asked Earl Childs, “Earl, I need $10,000 for this new program.  Dukakis will put up seven, and we’ll get started in four farmers’ markets where each WIC mother and child would get $20 in a voucher to buy fruits and vegetables at a farmers’ market.”\nSo we started that in ’86 and it expanded in two years later to throughout the state with state money, and then in 1992, Congressman Atkins from Lowell saw the program in his town and said, “I’m going to put this in the budget,” and he put up 15 million dollars for an annual national program for the WIC Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program.\n\tWe then added in 1989 a senior program to do the same thing for low-income seniors, and Congressman John Baldacci then put 15 million dollars in the Farm Bill, and I’ll come back to that, how that occurred.\n\tSo the WIC Farmers’ Market expanded very rapidly throughout the country in the nineties, and then in 1990 the World Bank said I’d better come back or I’d lose my job.  Since they paid better than the Commissionership and since the Republicans elected Weld governor instead of John Silber, I left the Department of Agriculture of Massachusetts.  I went back to work on Eastern Europe agriculture.\n\tAt that point, the [Berlin] Wall had fallen, and it was a very exciting time working in Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia on their agricultural reforms in the early nineties at that time, so I was in charge of most of many of the agricultural projects in those countries at that time, especially in Poland.  That was a terrific time because there was just a lot of energy in those countries.  Lech Walesa and Jaroslav Balzerowicz were all interested in reform.  The World Bank played a pretty major role in Poland in helping on the economic restructuring, and myself and a few others worked on a reform side.   That was a lively, lively time, really one of the most interesting times.\n\nQ:  The agricultural side of all of that got involved in what?\n\nSchumacher:  If you look at Poland, Poland had more farmers than America did.  People don’t realize that.  They have over 2.5 million small farmers in Poland, and the communist government in Poland was too strong politically, so unlike in Ukraine in the Stalin era in 1920s and thirties when they collectivized all those small farms in Ukraine, starved millions of Ukrainians doing that, that did not happen in Poland.\n\tSo after the war, when the Nazis then controlled Poland and then the Communists controlled Poland, the Communists left these small farms alone and then collectivized the German farms.  The big Prussian estates became Polish state farms.  So there was a bifurcation of big state farms, which were the former Russian, former German, Prussian, nobility and some nobility in Poland that had farms with over two million small Polish farms.  So you had a very interesting big farm-small farm structure, with all of the processing done by the state.\n\nQ:  Processing meaning?\n\nSchumacher:  Milk processing, vegetable processing, pierogi-making.  All the great Polish foods were all processed by the state.  So in 1990 the new government then, working with the World Bank, wanted to kind of rationalize that system, privatize again the big farms and have them done carefully and sell them off, rent them and then sell them to medium-sized farmers.  You’d then good new investment in privatized processing in the distribution.\n\tThere again, there was an explosion of the farmers’ markets when that happened, so you had all these small farmers then selling their products like we did in Massachusetts in the 1980’s and 1990’s, the explosion of farmers’ markets in Poland was fascinating, absolutely fascinating to see that change.\n\nQ:  The first explosion that you spoke of was where?\n\nSchumacher:  In Poland.\n\nQ:  Then at the same time, what was happening in the United States with small farms?\n\nSchumacher:  Again, if you come back to New York City, a gentlemen named Barry Benepe and his colleague Bob Lewis in 1976 started the Union Square and the 59th Street farmers’ markets.  Barry Benepe, city planner from MIT, Bob Lewis working in the New York Department of Agriculture, said, “Let’s try this out,” and it became very popular.  I read that famous New Yorker article that John McPhee wrote—\n\nQ:  Why don’t you describe what that was.\n\nSchumacher:  Again, coming back into the mid-seventies, I was still at the World Bank, I was on a plane coming back from London on some trip from Africa working on  agriculture.  I picked up a New Yorker at Heathrow Airport, and in the New Yorker this fellow John McPhee had this article where he went out and lived on a farm in the Hudson Valley, helped the farmer pick the vegetables, get on the truck at three o’clock in the morning and came into 59th Street and helped sell these vegetables from this truck with this farmer.  I think Dan Holland was his name.  Did this for a summer, and then wrote an article called “Giving Good Weight” in the New Yorker.  McPhee was a very, very fine writer.  He described growing the stuff in the Hudson Valley, picking and schlepping it down into New York and then selling it and they ran out of produce.  I mean, he was mobbed because people hadn’t seen this kind of quality that really hadn’t been in New York City since the thirties, since my great-grandfather and grandfather were selling at the Wallabout Farmers Market, at the Washington Square Market.  There were no more farmers’ markets in the 1950s and 1960s.  They were wiped out by the supermarkets, so that you couldn’t buy locally grown fresh fruits and vegetables from 1935 to 1976.\n\nQ:  The supermarkets came in about ’35?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.  Bohack, A & P, First National, and Gristedes, and they basically bought from California, Florida, and Texas.  Maybe some New York apples.  Of course, there weren’t any farms left in Queens.  Levitt came in, you know, took all the potato farms in Suffolk County and put in housing.  Same thing in New Jersey.  So your urban agriculture, the same thing happened in Boston.  You could not compete with root crops and salad crops with California, Florida, Texas.  You simply couldn’t compete.  So you were getting shipped-in product from far away, and there weren’t any local fresh, healthy—well, they were healthy, but there weren’t any local seasonal vegetables.  And that’s what Bob Lewis and Barry Benepe, they introduced or reintroduced local agriculture to the city of New York, and it just exploded.  I read that article, I said, “That’s really cool.”  So I called up Barry Benepe and I introduced myself to him.  We’ve been friends ever since.\n\tSo when I was Commissioner of Agriculture in Massachusetts, I said to Barry, “How do we do this stuff?”\n\tSo he helped me expand Freddie Winthrop’s work, and so we really promoted fruits and vegetables in farmers’ markets and started a bunch of these markets in Massachusetts.  I think in 1985 there were probably 20, 25 farmers’ markets in Massachusetts, and now there are 202.  So one out of every two towns in Massachusetts now has a farmers’ market.  I think New York City must have 50 or 60 farmers’ markets. While these markets are not a huge part of the American food system, but they’ve become a cultural part of the American food system where local chefs locally—they go to the market more as much for the healthy, interesting foods as for community.  They bring their dog and the kids in the strollers, and it becomes a community event where people can get up on a Saturday or Sunday and go down to the local farmers’ market and buy their strawberries or the asparagus, and that becomes all year-round.  They continue to come back to that and they continue to grow.  In 1980 there might have been 800 farmers’ markets in America.  This year there will be over 5,000.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nSchumacher:  In 1980 there might have been 3,000 farmers selling in the farmers’ markets.  This year there will be 40,000.  So it’s become a parallel food system as people have gone back to the roots that they had in 1910 and 1920, when my great-grandfather and grandfather were selling at the Washington Square Market, the Wallabout Market, and the Harlem Market directly to consumers or to small corner stores.\nSo what come around goes around, and the same crops, carrots and parsnips and leeks.  Looking back on it, my father grew six crops.  My brother, direct marketing, grew forty crops, so the new system requires much more management and technical capability of farmers selling at roadside stands and at farmers’ markets than it did for those farmers just selling wholesale in 1930, 1935, 1940, 1945 from this region.  So the technical demands on farm families now are far higher than they were thirty, forty, fifty years ago.\n\nQ:  How so?\n\nSchumacher:  Because, an example, you would harvest lettuce once or twice.  You’d plant twenty acres, you’d harvest it all at once, you’d sell it to the First National or Bohack and hope to make some money.  Now you’re going to a farmers’ market, customers want this lettuce year-round.  So how do you sell lettuce year-round?  That’s exactly what my grandfather did in 1905.  He was growing lettuce year-round in Queens for the Wallabout Farmers Markets, using all kinds of technologies, and those technologies are now being rethought to grow lettuce year-round for the markets in Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.\n\nQ:  Were you married during this period of time?\n\nSchumacher:  Early on, and then I was divorced and remarried later on.\n\nQ:  But I guess what I’m wondering is were you married when you were traveling around the world?\n\nSchumacher:  Oh, yes.  That travel did not do great things for my marriage, but that’s another subject.\n\nQ:  But without kids.\n\nSchumacher:  No children, no.\n\nQ:  So how long did that period last before your next kind of significant job?\n\nSchumacher:  1994, I was sitting in a bar in a hotel in Prague when some person came from the bar, carrying a blackboard with bells atop, and said, “Phone at the bar.”  I was working in Prague on an agricultural project, part of this changeover from communism to other systems.  So I took the phone, it was Washington and the caller asked, “Would you like to be considered for a position in the Clinton administration?”\n\tI said, “Sounds good to me.”  So I said, “Sure.”  Then I called my wife and said, “I just quit the World Bank.”\n\tShe said, “Fine.”\n\tSo I became head of the Foreign Agricultural Service for President Clinton at USDA and focused on promoting American agriculture exports around the world.\n\nQ:  How did they know about you?\n\nSchumacher:  I think I had met USDA Secretary Mike Espy during the Dukakis campaign when I was working for Dukakis, and Dukakis had an agricultural briefing at his home in Brookline, and I was sitting in on the briefing.  I picked up Mike Espy at the airport and drove him over, and he knew me at that point when I was commissioner.  Then the USDA Deputy Secretary knew me, Mr.Rich Rominger, said they were looking for somebody to run the Foreign Ag Service.  They said, “Well, let’s go to see if this Gus Schumacher is interested and see if he’d quit the Bank and take a salary cut.”  So sure, why not.\n\nQ:  Why Gus Schumacher?\n\nSchumacher:  Well, because I was doing interesting stuff.\n\nQ:  Like what?\n\nSchumacher:  Well, I got in a little trouble occasionally.  When Monsanto was sticking cows with bovine growth hormone in Massachusetts, I was a bit grouchy because I regulated the milk supply.  We didn’t know whether BST was safe or not.  They didn’t tell me.\n\nQ:  You mean bovine growth hormone?\n\nSchumacher:  Bovine growth hormone, BST.  I got very grouchy, and some reporter asked me, “What do you think about this?”  And I said I didn’t think much of it.  “I think it’s just “crack for cows.”  We ought to have a look at it.”\n\tHe said, “What did you say?”\n\tI said, “Oh, no, no.”\n\tHe said, “I heard you say it.”  And so he put that in the headline in a story in the Boston Globe, and that did not go down very well with the governor, and Monsanto was very grouchy about that.\n\tThen I did ban the chemical Alachlor from being sprayed on corn near public wells in western Mass., and that, again, was not very popular with—\n\nQ:  What was that?\n\nSchumacher:  It was a chemical, weed-control chemical that was used on corn that unclear whether it was carcinogenic or not, but I said, “Maybe you can do it where it doesn’t affect public wells, but when you’re going to be drinking the water, I don’t want something that was untested.”  It was unclear whether it was a carcinogenic or not.  I thought we’d take a little precaution, put a thousand-foot buffer around a public well and asked them not to spray Alachlor.  The Monsanto company was very, very grouchy about that.  Actually, when this ban was announced it in the Wall Street Journal, their stock fell three points.  I didn’t realize it was 52 percent of the profits of Monsanto.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nSchumacher:  And they were worried that this would be the camel under the tent, and this would then create more problems for the product around the country.  So I did get a number of calls on that one as well.\n\tThen I was very interested in local agriculture, and I was dating at the time, so I’d ask my dates to go to restaurants, but I’d take my own tomatoes.\n\nQ:  This was in Washington?\n\nSchumacher:  No, when I was Commissioner.\n\nQ:  In Massachusetts in about what period of time?\n\nSchumacher:  Eighty-six, ’87.\n\nQ:  Why did you take your tomatoes?\n\nSchumacher:  Well, because the tomatoes in the restaurants—there were some very great chefs, Jasper White, Lydia Shire, Gordon Hamersley, and I wanted to eat well and didn’t have a lot of money, but I enjoyed eating out.  So I’d take my dates to these restaurants and the food was good, but it wasn’t from Massachusetts, so I’d say, “What the heck, I’m going to bring my own tomatoes and lettuce.”\nSo I knew I was going into Lydia Shire’s restaurant over at the Bostonian, and I had some French farm specialist with me.  So I went to my brother’s farm and we picked some tomatoes, and they were good tomatoes.  These were really tasty, vine ripe August tomatoes, just at  peak of flavor.  So I went to Lydia’s with a little brown paper bag with five pounds of six varieties, Jet Stars and Celebrities, really nice tomatoes, and asked Lydia for a serrated knife and some vinaigrette.\n\t“What’s that about?”\n\t“I’ve got my own tomatoes.”\n\tShe was not a happy camper.  So we sliced them up, and we had some great tomatoes for lunch.\nSo I said, “What the heck.”  So I went over to Gordon Hamersley’s the next couple of days, and then had some left over, and I took them.  The woman I was dating, now I got married to, and it was a good test, because if she thought I was really off the wall, that would be the last date.  So I brought my tomatoes and we asked Gordon for a serrated knife, and said, “Gordon, do you mind?”\n\tHe got interested in it, and he said, “Not a problem.”\n\nQ:  This was the same brown paper bag approach?\n\nSchumacher:  Well, same brown paper, sitting down by the chair, just kind of by the table, you know, slice them up and put them on the table, bring a knife and vinaigrette.  So Gordon came over and he said—he knew me\n\nQ:  Fortunately.\n\nSchumacher:  And he said, “This is off the wall.”  He said to my wife, my girlfriend then, “What do you think about this?”\n\t“Good-tasting tomatoes.”\n\t“Do you mind hanging out with this crazy guy, bringing his own tomatoes to a nice restaurant?”\n\tShe said, “No, I’m interested in your reaction.”\n\tHe said, “Well, that’s interesting.”\nSo then we started featuring—my staff and I started going to all the restaurants and said, “Would you buy local?”\n\nQ:  Where did these tomatoes come from, by the way?\n\nSchumacher:  I was actually growing them on my brother’s farm, and I had my own tomato patch, and so varieties of tomatoes.  It was kind of fun.\n\tSo we got all the restaurants to start featuring local fruits and vegetables and local product, and Julia Child was very interested, because she would go out to Wilson’s farm and do the same thing.  She and Paul Child would go to Wilson’s, who I worked with, and they would buy their vegetables out there and then bring them back and she would feature them on National Public Television.\n\nQ:  What was Wilson’s full name?\n\nSchumacher:  Alan Wilson.  Wilson’s farm in Lexington, near our farm in Lexington.\n\tSo Julia and I would kind of go to these different places and feature local stuff.  I’d do it in restaurants and she’d do it on television.  It was fun.\nEventually, the Boston Globe started picking it up and wrote some stories featuring fresh local fruits and vegetables, fresh and grown, not just at farmers’ markets but also at local restaurants.  So we really promoted that pretty hard to get chefs to learn about the pairing and buying seasonally in Massachusetts, and that was easy to do because you had some of these farmers’ markets coming in.  They’d go to a farmers’ market like in Copley Square or in Harvard Square or in City Hall, and they could buy the stuff right there.  They didn’t have to schlep out to the local farms.\n\tBut then the chefs got interested in it, and they got more prosperous.  They moved their families to the suburbs.  On the way in to their restaurants, they would buy from local farms.  Gordon Hamersley then would stop every morning at Verrill’s Farm in Concord or Wilson’s farm in Lexington and fill up his trunk with local stuff and bring in it.  Then farmers started delivering to local restaurants, and that was kind of an interesting time to see how that local food movement—and the same thing started happening in New York because Danny Meyer located his restaurant down on Union Square, which was a drug haven in the seventies, but the Union Square farmers’ market helped turn it around.  He put his restaurant—I think it was called Green.  What was Danny Meyer’s restaurant called in Union Square?  Union Square Café.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nSchumacher:  And he would buy at the Union Square farmers’ market.  Then other farmers started coming into the farmers’ market in Union Square, and I have pictures of carts of stuff going out of Union Square where farmers started selling at those local markets.\n\tThen you had new young chefs coming in.  You had Danny Barber at Blue Hill, you had Michel Nischan at Heartbeat, and they started reaching out not only to local farmers’ markets, they started reaching out to new farmers, refugee farmers, Hispanic farmers, new varieties to bring into their restaurants.  So it’s kind of an interesting development of how the local food movement back in the seventies that Barry Benepe started with John McPhee evolved to households and consumers, but mostly middle class, and then evolved to higher-end restaurants and now has evolved to places like Whole Foods and others.  It’s kind of interesting to see that movement that really Barry Benepe and Bob Lewis started with McPhee’s great article in the New Yorker, which he later developed into a book called Giving Good Weight.\n\nQ:  Let’s go back a little bit.  In that Julia Child period, you were living up there?\n\nSchumacher:  When I was commissioner, yes, I lived in Boston.  I lived with my father for a while and then in an apartment, and then when he passed away, moved back to the farm.\n\nQ:  Then at what point did you go to Washington?\n\nSchumacher:  In 1990, moved back to Washington.  When Bill Weld took over and Dukakis—when the Democrats lost the governorship, I moved back to Washington and rejoined the World Bank.\n\nQ:  I’d like to actually talk about the press a little bit later, but I know one of the things that has helped you, I don’t know, be so influential is that you maintain your friendships with people from all these different aspects of your life and help them meet each other, whether it’s farmers or politicians or whatever, that you’ve been a bridge builder.  How do you react to that?\n\nSchumacher:  Well, one of the things that we tried to do with Dukakis, he was very good because he would go into the countryside in the summertime and meet people around there, and we would get chefs and farmers to put the lunches on.  So every time we’d have a big sort of a meeting, whether it was New Bedford or Hadley or Berkshires or the North Shore or the South Shore, I’d ask him if we could put the lunch on.  So I’d ask the local chefs to work with the local farmers to have a Mass. grown and fresh luncheon, and it was fun.  So we had this great food.  Then we’d ask the press to come.\n\nQ:  Did you know these local chefs and local farmers?\n\nSchumacher:  No, I knew the farmers, but I didn’t know the chefs.  But Janet Christensen, who is my communications director, really enjoyed good food, and she knew the food editors.  So she’d call up the food editors and say, “Do you know Terry Maloney or Tim Morse out there in Hadley?  He’s got a good farm.  Could he—?”\nAnd then we’d call him up.  I’d call him up and I’d say, “Can you bring your ciders to the event?  Could you bring these special cheeses from these different new cheese makers?”  That was very embryonic, these new varieties of cheeses back in the eighties.  People weren’t making these unique artisan cheeses then.  Specialty ciders.  Specialty cider pairings.  All these new products that people didn’t know about.  We’d invite them to come to these lunches, have the chefs prepare them, and then have the food editors come and they would write about them.  The Governor liked it a lot, because it was good food, and he liked good food.  He and Kitty liked eating well.\n\tI remember one day, got a little carried away, and I said, “Let’s have an all cider nine course elegant meal.”\n\nQ:  Who did you say that to?  [laughs]\n\nSchumacher:  To a great chef in Cambridge.  I forgot his name.  I called up the cider makers.  There were eight of them who were making great ciders, and I said, “I want to challenge the chef to have a nine-course meal, and each course be made with either hard or soft cider.”  There would be a cider sorbet or a cider vinaigrette, cider vinegar, a cider pork chop.  So we had a great evening.  The chef rose to the challenge.  We brought in ten cider makers, we brought in fifteen food editors, and we had a ball.  Of course, it was kind of crazy, but the writers wrote it up.\nThen I made a little mistake.  I love tomatoes.  So I started the Annual Massachusetts Tomato Tasting Contest back in 1986.\n\nQ:  Strictly Massachusetts tomatoes?\n\nSchumacher:  Strictly Massachusetts.  So you basically have all the tomato farmers coming together, and then you’d have the food editors come and judge, and the chefs.  So a woman in Washington named Phyllis Richman heard about this, and she said, “Can I come up to this contest?”  So she flew up to become a judge at the first Annual Massachusetts Tomato Tasting.  We had like thirty different varieties of tomatoes, and, of course, all these farmers were standing around.  This is in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in some park.  So we had the food editors and we had chefs and politicians judging these, and it was fun, and Phyllis got interested in it.  She went back to Washington.  I was in Massachusetts.  She wrote it up in the food page of the Washington Post, kind of this, again, crazy commissioner running tomato tasting.  So the next year I did it at City Hall.\n\nQ:  In Boston.\n\nSchumacher:  In Boston.  Neil Pierce, who was a Washington Post columnist, said, “Gus, I want in.  I’ve heard about this tomato contest.  You can’t just let food writers.  I’m a political writer.  I want in on this thing.”\n\nQ:  In the days when we had budgets for traveling around.\n\nSchumacher:  So he came up and he wrote a funny article, because I invited a California tomato grower, an old friend of mine, and he brought his tomatoes in a shoebox, picked them beautifully out of the field, flew in, and he got beaten by an eleven-year-old girl out of New Bedford for the top prize.\n\nQ:  That’s interesting, because you certainly wouldn’t think of Massachusetts as the natural home for good tomatoes.\n\nSchumacher:  But everybody grows good tomatoes.  People have to find out who they are.  So that contest, you know, we’re coming up to its twenty-fifth anniversary.  We started in ’86.  This year will be the twenty-third, and it’s a big deal.  You have about forty or fifty tomato growers vying for different categories.  Everybody wants to be a judge.  So you kind of have to sign up.  As Neil Peirce said, you’ve really got to know the politicians to get an invitation to the Boston Tomato Contest!\n\nQ:  I see.  [laughs]\n\nSchumacher:  He said, “You’ve got to really know.  I really worked this hard, and I got myself an invitation to be one of the senior judges at the Massachusetts Second Annual Tomato Tasting Contest,” and he put this out in the Washington Post.  Of course, he was syndicated and this went everywhere.  So I got a lot of grief for that.  Kind of fun.\n\nQ:  Where is it held now?\n\nSchumacher:  Same place.  That’s how I met John Ogonowski.\n\nQ:  And he was?\n\nSchumacher:  John Ogonowski was a pilot for American Airlines, and I have the original pictures in 1986 when he came to the tomato contest.  He flew for American Airlines during the day, and weekends he’d farm in Dracut, Mass.  He brought his tomatoes to the City Hall farmers’ market and won a prize.  His daughters are all eight, nine, ten years old.  Later, in the 1990s when I was undersecretary, I remembered John.  He lives in Dracutt, Mass  and I called him up.  I said, “John, we’ve got all these new refugees from Cambodia.  You’ve got a big farm.  Would you lease them a couple acres so they could grow some stuff?”  Because they were all coming in from Vietnam and Laos.\n\nQ:  Actually, let’s explain what that was.  Could you tell me who these refugees were and how they got here?\n\nSchumacher:  I wasn’t a veteran, but many of my friends were in Vietnam in the war in the sixties, including my college roommate.  In the Vietnam War, the CIA recruited hill tribesmen called Hmong and Lao to fight, who didn’t like the communists.  The communists were basically flatlanders.  They were rice growers.  And these were Hmong, basically tribesmen in the mountains, and they were anti-communists, and so the CIA recruited them to fight the communists in the sixties and early seventies.\n\nQ:  Recruited them, meaning they would be paid or given—\n\nSchumacher:  Weapons.  They would rescue our pilots who were shot down.  They would do ambushes.  It was spooky, spooky stuff, but they were very effective against the communists and created a lot of havoc for the communists along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.  When the war was then terminated, they decided they’d better get out, because they were then shot by the communists.\n\nQ:  About how many people are we talking about?\n\nSchumacher:  A million, maybe two million, a lot.\n\nQ:  Significant.\n\nSchumacher:  A lot.  A lot.  And many of them escaped to Thailand, to camps, and because they had fought for the Americans, they became refugees and were allowed to come to America back in the mid-seventies and eighties from these camps.  So hundreds of thousands came.\n\nQ:  But this was sort of gradual, wasn’t it?\n\nSchumacher:  Gradual.  Not all at once.\n\nQ:  And we brought them here?\n\nSchumacher:  We brought them.  The State Department flew them in to settle all over America, including Lowell.  Many states, in the Central Valley of California.\n\nQ:  Under what aegis were they—\n\nSchumacher:  State Department, official refugees.  We bring in 80,000 refugees a year from around the world.  They were brought in in a special refugee category.  They liked to farm, and they started farming.  I did not know this.  I did not know these people existed until I met one of the accidentally at a meeting and said, “Oh, let me come out and visit with them.”\n\nQ:  You were at that point?\n\nSchumacher:  Undersecretary of Agriculture in 1998, ’97.  I remember the guy’s name was Charlie Chang, and he said, “Well, come on out.”\n\tI said, “I’ll be out in Fresno in a couple weeks.  I’ll maybe get a few people together and have breakfast.”\n\tHe said to me, “You know, Mr. Undersecretary, we don’t actually do eggs and bacon at seven o’clock in the morning.  We normally have more of a family meal in the fields with basically rice and veggies and a little bit of meat.”\n\t“Okay, fine.  I’ll be there.”  So we found out where they were, and I got a pickup and went out to the field and had a wonderful meal at ten o’clock in the morning, sort of a Asian vegetable rice meal with a bit of pork or chicken, with you fingers.\n\nQ:  This was where?\n\nSchumacher:  In Fresno, California.  I discovered there were two thousand of these Hmong farmers farming on a few rented acres all over the Central Valley of California.  I said, “Whoa, that’s interesting,” and I started getting interested.  There were these farms all over America, but no one knew about them.  They were on one or two acres, three acres, six acres.  Did not have access to any federal programs because they couldn’t speak the language, and they sold wherever they could sell, whether the flea markets or the little roadside stand or whatever.\n\nQ:  So just to be clear, we brought them in.  That is to say, the United States brought them in, but then did not give them any financial support afterwards?\n\nSchumacher:  Maybe six months.  Refugees are still coming in, but they get six months of food stamps and welfare payments.  Then they’re on their own.  Give them a rental stipend and give then citizenship or access to citizenship, but they’re legal refugee immigrants, and they’re coming in from Russia, from Bosnia, from Vietnam.\n\nQ:  You mean now?\n\nSchumacher:  Now.  Somalia, Kenya, anywhere there’s a big conflict and they were on the wrong side.  We’re very generous in having them come in.  They’re all over America.  Somalian, Liberian, you name it, they’re everywhere and they’re farming.  So I felt that we need to at least give them equal access to federal programs, for credit marketing, technical assistance, so they get the same access as any other Midwestern Iowa corn grower would have.\n\nQ:  How did you do that?\n\nSchumacher:  By basically hiring some of their sons and daughters who spoke English to go into those offices and help them fill out loan applications.\n\nQ:  Loan applications at what offices?\n\nSchumacher:  At the county USDA office.  Every county in America, in rural America, has an office, USDA, where they provide services, whether it’s credit, marketing, world development, conservation.  I said those thousands of farmers should have the same access to those offices as your traditional corn grower in Indiana has.\n\nQ:  Even though they’re not citizens, or were they?\n\nSchumacher:  They were citizens.\n\nQ:  They were instantly made citizens?\n\nSchumacher:  Well, they had the legal right to the way to become citizenship, to access all federal programs.  So I said, “Let’s hustle and get them access,” and so we hired their sons and daughters who spoke English and trained them up to be loan officers.  So when they came to the counter to fill out an application, someone spoke their language, someone understood where they’re coming from, could understand their financial system and help them get a loan.\n\nQ:  You could do this all on your own?  Did you have to get permission from—\n\nSchumacher:  No.  No, I was undersecretary.\n\nQ:  I understand, but did you need Secretary clearance, no?\n\nSchumacher:  No, just go out and do it.  Just tell my staff to do it.\n\nQ:  And you had enough of a budget with flexibility so that—\n\nSchumacher:  Yes, oh, sure.  If you’re undersecretary and you don’t do things, then you shouldn’t be doing it.  So I just instructed the staff, “This is what I want to do,” and we went and did it.  No big deal.\n\nQ:  How quickly was that?\n\nSchumacher:  Took six months.  When you’re confirmed—people don’t quite understand.  When you’re confirmed by the Senate to be undersecretary, all these confirmations, that’s a big deal, because the Senate basically says, “We approve that you are qualified to do your job,” have gone through all the bits and pieces, and you have authorities.  Like I had authority over the Commodity Credit Corporation, which was 30 billion dollars, to carry out certain policies to basically promote and benefit American agriculture, which is written in the 1935 law by Roosevelt in the New Deal.  It was that authority that I could tap to provide 15 million dollars to create a senior farmers’ market nutrition program for one million low-income elders.  You just look at the fine print and say there’s nothing that says you can’t do it.  So we just told the staff to go do it, and informed Congress about it, and Congress seemed to like it and put it in legislation.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we take up from there—\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSchumacher - 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Gus Schumacher\t\t\t\t\t\t   Session #2\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t    Washington, D.C.\n\nDate:  October 6, 2009\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It’s October 6, 2009, and I am with Gus Schumacher at his home in Georgetown in Washington, D.C.\n\tGood afternoon.  We were talking before about the kinds of opportunities and responsibilities to make policy that somebody confirmed to an appointment by the Senate has.  So could you articulate what the expected responsibilities of your job were and the kinds of goals or ideas that you had for it, ways in which you could make an impact?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.  Well, first, it’s interesting.  There’s not that many Senate-confirmed people in USDA.  There’s the secretary, the deputy, and maybe five other undersecretaries.  So you’re expected to do three things.  One, you’re expected to testify at the will of the Congress.  You have to come up, actually swear that you’ll be up briefing the Congress at any time they wish to call you up and testify both to the House and the Senate on how things are going in your group and the programs under it.  Then you’re encouraged to basically make policy within the framework of the legislative authorities.  Those authorities are very large.  They go back into the thirties.  They’re written fairly broadly, but you are authorized within the legislative framework to set policy.  So there’s a number of things you can do, and that was the intent of Congress, to make it a bit more flexible.  We’ll come back to that under the Commodity Credit Corporation.\n\nQ:  The legislative authority in this case gave you the responsibilities and opportunities to do what?\n\nSchumacher:  We do a whole series of things.  For example, you have the whole international food aid programs, so there’s a lot of flexibility in how you run those programs.  Secretary Glickman and I used those authorities quite aggressively, and at one point we were doing almost 2 billion dollars of food aid.  We’d keep Congress informed, but we didn’t need congressional permission to do that.\n\tSimilarly, we talked earlier about the nutritional program, which is stretching our authorities a little bit, but I discovered there were authorities in the Commodity Credit Act of 1935 that did not specify fruits and vegetables, so it said agricultural products.  Well, fruits and vegetables are an agricultural product, so I asked the lawyers could I not do it.  They said, “Well, you can do it, but no one’s done it before.”  So we said can we do a senior farmers’ market nutrition program, and I would transfer money to the Food and Nutrition Service, 15 million dollars, to start having a million seniors of low income go to a farmers’ market, to promote and stabilize the fruit and vegetable industry by small farmers.  They said, “Well, you know, it’s not been done.  It’s a little stretching the authorities, but you’re not going to get indicted if you do it, as long as you inform Congress five days after you get permission from the President to do it.”  So we created the program, Secretary Glickman signed off on it, the White House blessed it, and we did it.\n\nQ:  When you took the job, did you have some specific goals that you hoped to bring to fruition?\n\nSchumacher:  There were two parts to my work at USDA.  The first three or four years was in the Foreign Ag Service to promote American exports and to do food aid and to keep American exports competitive and to monitor imports and exports, and that was a fun job.  There was a lot of trade negotiations going on, on the Uruguay Round, on NAFTA, on China.  There was a lot of travel to Asia as markets shifted from Europe to Asia.  In the developing countries, I tried to shift our attention in the Foreign Ag Service from Paris and London to Beijing and Jakarta, and there was a lot of resistance to that by the staff.\n\nQ:  Why was that?\n\nSchumacher:  They all wanted to go to Paris and London.  That was the culmination of their career, to be the Minister Counselor for Paris, London, Denmark, Spain, and Rome.  It wasn’t Beijing, Shanghai, Jakarta, Malaysia, and Islamabad.\n\nQ:  Why were you doing what you were doing?\n\nSchumacher:  Well, that was as head of the Foreign Ag Service, to shift the promotion of our exports to the fastest growing markets.\n \nQ:  That’s why it was headed toward Asia?  Because they were the fastest growing markets.\n\nSchumacher:  Yes, absolutely.  China takes 50 percent of our soybeans, Japan takes a third of our corn.  At the peak of the market in ’97, ’98, there were enormous numbers of grapes and apples going to Jakarta, and they were being sold on street corners.  It was a very large and rapidly growing market.  Similarly for Taiwan.  The markets were exploding in Asia, and that was the right thing to do.  They are now our largest markets, which is East and Southeast Asia.\n\nQ:  You brought to this the knowledge of an agricultural economist, having spent so much time overseas, so actually it’s hard to imagine somebody who would have understood those markets as precisely as you did, and, of course, you were a farmer.\n\nSchumacher:  There was a lot of staff interest in it, but the senior staff were a little bit more comfortable, as I would be.  Your fantasy is to be the Minister Counselor, sitting overlooking London’s Grosvenor Square, in a gorgeous office next to the Ambassador, with a beautiful home in Mayfair, which was right after the war.  I would have loved that.  But that’s not where the market was.  The market was in the middle-income areas of Jakarta, in Kuala Lumpur, in the Philippines, and especially in Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Taiwan.\n\nQ:  The job you were doing related to the part of the USDA that has to do with the promotion of American agriculture.\n\nSchumacher:  Right.  And you have to remember that people talk about our trade balance, but in agriculture we’ve always had a positive trade balance.  This year we’ll export 101 billion dollars worth of food.  That’s up when I was at FAS in 1996 over $40 billion to $60 billion.  We only import about $75 billion, even though it’s a lot.  So we were contributing anywhere from 10 to 30 billion dollars in net foreign exchange earnings.  You can’t say that for much of the rest of the economy.\n\nQ:  The other side of responsibilities of the USDA, which have more to do with health and nutrition, had they always interested you as well, or was that something that you gradually—\n\nSchumacher:  It interested me, but it was not under my purview.  It was under the Food and Nutrition Service.  When I became Undersecretary, the job was to basically write big checks to growers for the Commodity Credit Corporation for basically subsidies, to oversee the Foreign Ag Service, to oversee the crop insurance, and oversee the commodity programs.  I then became chairman of the Crop Insurance Board.  So it was a lot of what I call the core part of USDA, which was working with basically the mainstream family farmers on their subsidy programs, on their export programs, and on their insurance programs.  Nutrition was part of the Food and Nutrition Service, but when you look at the authorities, it did appear that there was authority under the Commodity Credit Corporation to transfer money to promote better nutrition by seniors, so we figured out how to do it.\n\nQ:  Specifically seniors?\n\nSchumacher:  In this case seniors, because we already had Congressional authority under the Women, Infants and Children program.  But there was no authority for Seniors.  So we said, “We can do the program for one year.”  So we found authority to do 15 million dollars, transferred CCC [Commodity Credit Corporation] money to the Food and Nutrition Service, worked it out with my good friend Shirley Watkins, who was then the undersecretary, and then they put it in the subsequent year, and it’s been there ever since.\n\nQ:  Did you become more interested in the health and nutrition side of things, or were you always interested in that?\n\nSchumacher:  It went back to the time that I was selling for my brother.  I think we mentioned that in the earlier discussion when that pear box fell apart.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nSchumacher:  I just remember that.  Here’s a woman whose husband had left her with two young boys, and here’s fruit that was wonderful, that I was going to take back, I wasn’t going to throw it out, but would bring it back somewhere, and she was in the gutter picking it up.  That kind of stuck with me.\n\nQ:  You must have been impressed that it was fruits and vegetables that she was really seeking out and didn’t have the money to pay for them.\n\nSchumacher:  Clearly, when you run the CD forward three tracks to the early part of this 21st century where 30 percent of our children now are pre-diabetic and obese, up from 15 percent ten years ago, there’s something going on.\n\nQ:  That’s extraordinary.\n\nSchumacher:  So people who are on food stamps are shopping the middle of the aisle rather than the edges of the supermarket, so they’re buying calories because they’re cheap.  A two-liter Coke and a pizza you can probably get for six bucks.  But you go and try and buy pears and apples and broccoli, you’d maybe get three pounds and then there’s a bit of wastage with that.  So they’re going for calories to feed their hunger.  They’re not going for nutrition to be healthy.  That’s a problem.\n\tOn the other hand, the farmers are producing, like my brother was, very wonderful, healthy food here, all kinds of fruits, peaches, pears, apples, raspberries, strawberries on the farm.  We had all kinds of vegetables we were taking to the markets.  You’d bring back a quarter load because you couldn’t sell it and then you’d compost it.  Wonderful stuff, you know.  If there was gleaning, we could have given it away.  But I see the same thing here in Washington where the farmers are bringing in beautiful stuff and taking some home, or more and more, giving it to soup kitchens.\nSo I thought there must be a better way of handling this to connect the big money in nutrition with the availability of excellent fruits and vegetables grown within thirty miles of major metropolitan areas.\n\nQ:  In terms of shifting your responsibilities, how did you bring some of that under your purview?\n\nSchumacher:  Well, mainly with the senior farmers’ market nutrition program, and then encouraging other programs to link with small farmers through the crop insurance programs, and just having dialogues within the USDA department on this material and these ideas.\n\tThe new Administration seems to be, after eight years of President Bush, Mr. [Tom] Vilsack and Miss [Kathleen] Merrigan and the White House seemed to be encouraging this a lot more than I would have expected, and I’m very pleased about that.\n\nQ:  Had there been many people at high-level positions in the USDA who had been farmers and small farmers?\n\nSchumacher:  A few, but most senior officials had experience from academia or from the farm organizations.\n\nQ:  So you brought real farm on-the-ground understanding.\n\nSchumacher:  Well, my brother and I farmed a little bit together, my father and I farmed, and my great-grandfather, and so we knew how to drive a tractor, let’s put it that way, and also we were in the vegetable business.  The vegetable business is different than corn and soybeans, which is mechanized.  Vegetables, you have to go out and actually pick it.  It’s a lot of handwork with vegetables, hand labor, and then you grow a much wider variety of crops.  So it requires a different skill set.  A corn farmer has a lot of great skills, but it’s very short.  You have to time the planting right and you have to time the harvest right, and then in between the planting and the harvest, you pray, and maybe a little cultivation now.  But with vegetables, you have to grow the starts, you have to time the planting so that it’s just after the frost, you hope.  There’s a lot of cultivation, there’s a lot of weeding, and then you have to care for those plants, and then there’s multiple harvests through the whole thing.  There’s a lot of skill required for both, but you have to be on top of it.\n\nQ:  You traveled around the country a lot, didn’t you?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.\n\nQ:  When you were traveling around, that was for what purpose?\n\nSchumacher:  When I was head of the Foreign Ag Service, we traveled, did a lot of hearings and a lot of visits to small exporters.  I did not realize that 90 percent of our almonds are exported.  I did not realize that.  Indians love almonds, and so we export a ton of almonds to India.  Between Spain and America, we dominate the world almond market, and that’s still the case.  I did not know that we export so many almonds.\n\tThen the whole horticulture of apples to the Caribbean at Christmastime is a big market for New York apples, and the Dominican Republic and the islands.  I did not know that the market even existed.  There’s a big market for Massachusetts Macintosh in Liverpool, of all things.  I did not know that.  So you learn a lot.  All the different spices that we import, but we also export, and the whole food-safety issue.  So that was fascinating to see.  When you export 100 billion dollars worth of food, that comes from somewhere and an awful lot of people are involved in that.\n\nQ:  You also met a lot of people as you were traveling around, and you’re a very accessible guy and you seemed to be able to keep track of everybody you met and help people make connections with each other in the future.  That obviously wasn’t part of the job, but that’s part of your personality.\n\nSchumacher:  You make a lot of friends.  I really enjoy getting out and particularly meeting farmers and especially some of the smaller fellows and women farmers that can be a bit overlooked from time to time, but they’re doing some pretty innovative things out there in the countryside.\n\tLike the Native American tribes, people are fascinated by their specialty foods that they grow on their reservations, so we organized, when we had an overseas exhibit, that the Montana tribes would have booths in Japan and Beijing.  Well, that was a great hit, all these Native American foods never eaten before, like us eating imported sushi.  They’re looking at some of these specialty dried meats and buffalo meats and others, bison, that are handled on the reservation.  So it was a two-way deal.\n\nQ:  So would you say that your goals, as it were, what you were trying to do, changed as you learned more about what was going on in this country?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.  I just came back from California this past week, and there’s an increasing disconnection, disjoint--I don’t know quite the word--a disjoint between our urban and pari-urban and peri-urban families, and food is beginning to come back a little bit with the explosion of the farmers’ markets.  But certainly in the eighties and nineties, there’s a widening of not distrust, but just didn’t know where the food came from.  Farmers were considered to be kind of greedy.  They were called “spray and pray.”  They were polluting the water.\n\nQ:  What was that?\n\nSchumacher:  Spray and pray, you basically spray your crops with pesticides and then pray that everything is going to work out well.\n\tA sort of discomfort settled in.  I think part of my job, certainly when I was commissioner and when I was at USDA, was trying to bridge that gap a little bit more.  I worked really hard at that in Massachusetts to make the connection between the consumers, the restaurants, the urban and peri-urban areas and the farmers.  So when there were some difficulties, there was a level of comfort.\n\tYet when I came back from California, even now in the twenty-first century, this rural-urban gap seems to be widening.  The consumers don’t trust the agriculture.  There was even a hearing to ban or wipe out the Department of Agriculture in California, which is the largest state in the country on agriculture, and yet some state senators thought that they weren’t doing very much and wanted to eliminate them in the budget.  Extraordinary.\n\tThere’s some gaps that I tried to bridge when I was both as a commissioner and when I worked for the government, and I’m still trying to do it now with the connection with these new programs we’re working on and the vulnerable, not just to buy fresh fruits and vegetables at the Safeway or the Giant, but to buy their fruits and vegetables from the local farmers.  So you’re using nutrition money to work twice, to nourish the consumers but also financially nourish the farmers that developed that on a direct basis.\n\nQ:  When did you particularly become interested in the vulnerable?\n\nSchumacher:  I think that pear box.  I think that that kind of stuck with me, how someone would be groveling in the gutter in Dorchester for three or four pounds of Bosc pears.  I said, “What’s that all about?”  I hadn’t really thought about it much before that, and that just kind of stuck with me.  I said, “That’s not right.”  I think particularly since we had them, we had tons of surplus fruits and vegetables, why should she be in the gutter, taking food out of the gutter?  That’s not right.\n\nQ:  Were you able to act on that in your job at the USDA?\n\nSchumacher:  To some extent with the seniors, but much more importantly since I left the USDA, where we’re trying to link and provide a whole series of programs with vouchers and other technologies to enable WIC and seniors and now food stamps to go to a farmers’ market or go to a market stand or go to a CSA and buy affordable fresh fruits and vegetables produced by family farmers twenty, thirty miles away.\n\nQ:  When did you learn how to work with the press?  Because one of the reasons you’ve been so effective is being able to really talk about what you were doing and communicate with the press.\n\nSchumacher:  I had some friends when I was at the Harvard Business School in 1980, I think it was, or 1970.  I can’t remember what it was.  1980, I think.  There were some Nieman Fellows who were in our classes.  Sonja Hilgren was one of them, and some others.  We all became kind of friends.  They were interested in agriculture, and we just sort of hung out.  I realized these are nice people who are interested in the subject and kind of got friendly.  Then their circle widened and then Sonja introduced me to Ward Sinclair.\n\nQ:  The Washington Post reporter?\n\nSchumacher:  At the Washington Post, and then Peter Milius, one of the editors.  Then when I was commissioner in the eighties, I kept in touch with Ward.  I wasn’t frightened of the media.  As long as you’re open and straightforward and create a little bit of interest, you don’t have to get your name in the paper all the time.  You can call Peter Anderson at the Boston Globe, who wrote a column, and say, “Peter, there’s an interesting story.  Do you know what geotropic flowers are?”\n\tAnd he said, “What are geotropic flowers?”\n\t“Well, they’re grown on Andy Cupp’s farm in Lexington, Massachusetts.”\n\tAnd he said, “Well, what are they?”\n\t“Well, they’re snapdragons.”  You can’t ship snapdragons from Colombia because their geotropic.\n\nQ:  What does that mean?\n\nSchumacher:  You know what a snapdragon is?  It’s a flower.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nSchumacher:  If you lie it flat, the top will curl up towards gravity, so you have to grow them straight up and harvest them straight up.  You can’t lie them down, and so you can’t really ship them very well.\n\tSo Andy Cupp was growing all these snapdragons.  So Peter called me back.  He said, “Hey, great story.  Went out and did the geotropic snapdragon,” but then found that he had a great dog and did a dog story.  He got two columns out of it.\n\tSo, again, if you let people know.  As you travel around and you find lots of interesting things that may not be directly related to agriculture, but the press is interested and they have to write a story.\n\tThe second I learned from one of my fellow Commissioners, that you return phone calls and don’t give the phone calls to a media person in the office.  If you don’t know the answer, tell them you’ll call them back.  If you do know the answer and it’s bad, tell them it’s bad and then give them some phone numbers who are your opponents.  That they really appreciate, because most of them earn very little money.  They want to get home.  They earn thirty, forty thousand at the max.  They want to go home for dinner by four.  They don’t want to be hanging around waiting for a phone call to finish their story.  So give them all the phone numbers of the people who don’t agree with you.\n\nQ:  Was that instinctive on your part or did you think it through?\n\nSchumacher:  I don’t know.  Just happened, I guess.  Putting yourself in their position, you know.  A lot of the reporters like here in Washington, the young reporters in the local press or the radio, whatever, live in Takoma Park.  Well, that’s a ways away.  That’s a good hour, forty-five minutes by Metro, and they want to get home by five or six.  They have young families.  Let them finish their story and get on with it.\n\nQ:  You know that very few government officials think like that.  [laughs]\n\nSchumacher:  Well, it was much more difficult when I was undersecretary, but not so difficult.\n\nQ:  Because you were busier?\n\nSchumacher:  What I would do was we called it the ‘solstice interviews.’  You know the solstice?\n\nQ:  Yes.  But tell me what the solstice interviews are.\n\nSchumacher:  Every three months, I’d invite the wire service and the reporters, maybe ten or twelve, say eight or ten reporters to cover agriculture, and I’d invite them to my office when I was head of the Foreign Ag Service and just say, “Here’s what happened the last quarter.”  Clint Eastwood.  Good, bad, and ugly.  “Here’s what I anticipate happening you may want to think about or cover in the next quarter.  Here’s where I’ll be traveling.  Here are the issues of the day.”  Sometimes on the record, sometime just a chat, cup of tea.\n\nQ:  And people came?\n\nSchumacher:  Oh yes, until then someone in the secretary’s office said enough is enough.  It was helpful to the reporters.\n\nQ:  Enormously.  Why did anybody in the secretary’s office say enough is enough?\n\nSchumacher:  Oh, just they were uncomfortable with it.  I wasn’t getting into the press very much, but I think they felt that should be done at a higher level than an Administrator in the Foreign Ag Service.  But it was very, very helpful to President Clinton as we tried to get the agricultural people to sign on to a lot of these trade agreements, and so I would do a great deal of media work.\nWhen I was overseas, it would be twelve hours’ difference between Tokyo and here, and I’d call back on the radio and do live interviews in regional local stations, timing them.  “I’m here at the Tsukij fish market looking at monkfish livers in this place here,” and I’d call back to the radio station, newspapers in New Bedford and they would put me on live.  I said, “I’m here promoting monkfish livers from New Bedford.  It’s a really good market.  We’re going to do some events in New Bedford when I get back.  We’re going to have a monkfish liver dinner.  You all got to come.”  It’s not eaten there, but it’s making our fishermen a bit more prosperous than they otherwise would be.  Well, Barney Frank heard that.\n\nQ:  He heard it on the local radio station?\n\nSchumacher:  On Drive Time, when he was in New Bedford.  He liked that, so he came to the dried fish dinner, the monkfish liver dinner.  It was fun.\n\nQ:  It’s certainly in my experience as a reporter, most government officials are afraid to talk to you and send you through the press office.  But you were more comfortable dealing directly with journalists.\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.  I got burned several times, but you go with the flow.  I mean, there were some reporters that—it was never personal, but they would twist a few things.  But I didn’t try and record everything I said, but I remembered it, and if things were not done right, I would call the reporter back.\n\tThen also some of the stories were really, really good and really helpful, I’d call the editor and I’d say, “Ward Sinclair’s story on corn was really outstanding.  Would you pass that on?”  Or send a little personal letter to the editor, pass it on that Cass Peterson or whoever was there, but also make it fun for the reporters.  I remember during a tomato tasting in Lawrence, Mass., the first time we did it, I said, “Who can I get to be the judge?  I’ll call up Phyllis Richman.”\n\nQ:  Yes, we talked about that.  That was very smart of you.\n\nSchumacher:  She had a good time.  She came up and she put an article in the food page on tasting tomatoes in Massachusetts.\n\nQ:  That was something that you realized early on, wasn’t it, that articles on the food page could be just as effective as articles on the front pages?\n\nSchumacher:  Frankly, I think it was more effective.  I think that the food editors have more time to write.  They understand food.  They would like to write about policy.  Often their editors just won’t let them.  But if you can make it a food-related story about policy, whether it’s food safety or doing a whole range of things with food, they’ll write them up.  I found it was really helpful to me politically and policy-wise, not so much politically, but policy, because all the politicians, all my superiors, would read the food pages.  It was the second most read paper after Sunday, and often they were at first in color.  I think I mentioned the story with the governor in color in the food page.\n\nQ:  Tell me about that.\n\nSchumacher:  Well, I made a little mistake and I challenged New York and New Jersey to a tomato taste-off, and so I took my tomatoes down to the Union Square Farmers’ Market.  It was kind of a fun thing.  But I didn’t think it was appropriate to tell the press in Boston.  So Marian Burros from the New York Times heard about this and called Sheryl Julian.\n\nQ:  Who was that?\n\nSchumacher:  Sheryl Julian was the food editor of the Boston Globe.  Said, “Your crazy commissioner’s challenged New Jersey and New York to a tomato taste-off next Monday at the Union Square Farmers’ Market.  Did he tell you this?”\n\t“No, he didn’t tell me that.  That’s a great story.”  New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, the little Gulliver taking on the giants of tomatoes.  She said, “I think I’ll come down and bring a photographer.”  Well, she didn’t tell me this.\nAlso we had wagons with horses.  We had the New Jersey, the New York, and the Massachusetts carts loaded up with fresh vegetables coming down Broadway—it was lots of fun—to the Union Square Farmers’ Market.  I saw this fellow running around taking pictures.  I didn’t pay any attention to it.  Then I saw Sheryl turn up, doing interviews.  Oh, gee, this is interesting.  Well, she really got into it and did a two-page story in color, lots of color pictures, and that was the first time the Globe used color, but they did it on the food pages.\nThe next Wednesday that story came out, the governor rang me up and said, “Commissioner, how are ya?”  \n\tI said, “I’m fine.”\n\tHe said, “I saw you were in New York, out of state.  You lost, too, didn’t you?”\n\tI said, “Well, I’m sorry about that.  I should have probably told you.”\n\nQ:  You mean the tomato tasting you lost.\n\nSchumacher:  But it was fun, because it put tomatoes—Massachusetts was equal to New Jersey and New York on food.  We had a lot of fun.  Massachusetts vegetables go to New York.  I enjoyed that.  You have to have a little fun at this.\n\tWell, then he said, “Good, that was pretty good color pictures.  Next time invite me,” because it’s color.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  But you must have consciously realized that by reaching out to the press, you were reaching out to the public.\n\nSchumacher:  Well, it paid off in spades.  It paid off unbelievably well, because what happens was, we were a tiny agriculture in Massachusetts, and 6 million people and maybe 6,000 farmers.  So we were tiny.  I mean micro.\nBut then some well-meaning young people in Somerville and Cambridge decided they would take on a referendum to ban animal agriculture, PETA people, in Massachusetts, and they managed to get enough signatures in those two cities to go on the ballot, set Question three, that basically banned animal agriculture as cruel.\n\nQ:  Meaning agriculture that would kill the animals?\n\nSchumacher:  No, just anybody raising animals.  They wanted a vegetarian society.  So they thought if they could get a ban passed in Massachusetts, they then could take it to other states on a referendum.\n\tSo that was awkward.  So what we did was, we had every farmer in the farmers’ market publicize “vote no” on question three.  People come to farmers’ markets.  They understood this.  Even though they were veggie growers, they understood the importance of animals.  Then we went to all the editorial boards, and I’d bring a farmer with me.  I’d go to the farm.  I’d ask the reporter to come out with a photographer.  I’d have the farmer wrap himself around a calf or bunny or something and say, “These people take care of their animals.”\n\tThen I’d go to the editorial board with the farmer and I’d ask them a question.  “You’re Fred Hiatt,” or whatever your name is, “of the Washington Post.  Fred, I’m here with my friend Bob, a dairy farmer, and his son, Harry, and they raise two hundred cows.  They’ve been doing a good job in Rutland, Mass.  Can I ask you a question, Mr. Editor, before we sit down?  How many cases of child abuse do we have in Massachusetts last year, and how many cases of animal abuse by farmers like were sitting here?”\n\tAnd he said, “Oh, I don’t really know.  A few cases of child abuse, and thousands of cases of animal abuse.”\n\tI said, “No, there’s 27,000 cases of child abuse that were reported in Massachusetts and proven, and as far as we could tell, there were no cases of proven animal abuse.  Mr. Editor, wouldn’t it be better if these wonderful young people in Somerville and Cambridge would take care of our children as well as these farmers are taking care of their animals?  Do you understand me?”  It was a killer.  We had to get police protection.  The editors would all write that story, and then we’d have a policeman in front of the house, because the PETA people were furious.  My father and I were the same name, so they were threatening to come out and do damage to our home.\nBut that was, again, the importance of having the urban and rural people having a little bit of understanding by promoting farmers’ markets, by promoting a linkage between rural and urban, so that when something really bad happened, like a referendum that would ban a part of agriculture, we beat that by 71 percent to 29 percent in the election of 1988.  We beat them so bad in the polls, and that was the year Dukakis lost the presidential election.  The law was that you had to win by more than 30 percent.\n\nQ:  In order to—\n\nSchumacher:  To come back to another referendum.  So they could never come back on an animal rights referendum again in Massachusetts in history, because they lost so badly.  They never broke the 30 percent barrier.  It was very interesting to see.\n\tWe ran that campaign ourselves, not with fancy lobbyists in Washington.  They were furious down here, all the meat people and dairy people.  They wanted to flock in and take the campaign over and put out fancy stuff.  I said, “No, we’ll do it ourselves.”\n\nQ:  What was the campaign?\n\nSchumacher:  It was “Question Three’ on the banning of animal agriculture referendum.  I felt good about that campaign.  That was a political campaign.  We cleaned their clock.\n\nQ:  That was while you were commissioner?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.\n\nQ:  How long were you at the USDA?\n\nSchumacher:  1994 to 2001.\n\nQ:  What are you particularly proud of or happy with in terms of what you achieved during those years?\n\nSchumacher:  Working on our foreign trade and opening up new markets, shifting from what I call the old Europe to the new markets in Asia and Latin America, rejiggering the way we managed it so there was a more of a balance between fancy places in Paris, London, Spain, and Rome, and less but more aggressive places in the Far East.  Secondly, we worked really, really worked hard, on food crises I mean, the most proud of [unclear] Secretary Glickman and I, I think we’ve talked about this, we’re really proud of the way the USDA acted when there were food crises around the world.\nWe were able to step up very quickly and help to mitigate food crises, whether it was food aid to Africa, but particularly in two instances, one in ’97, ’98, when there was a financial crisis in Asia when they couldn’t buy food because the banks wouldn’t lend them money.  I went to Secretary Glickman and I said, “We need to use all of our authorities to provide credits so they can buy food, and where they can’t, we’ll give food aid.”\n\tHe said, “Go to it.”  He was very supportive.\nThere was a wonderful story.  In ’97 I was negotiating with the Koreans, and I gave them my business card.  The Korean Minister of Agriculture, actually we exchanged cards, and I said, “Okay, I know you don’t want to use these credit facilities now, but if you ever do in the future, keep my card and send me an e-mail.”  This is when e-mails were just becoming a little bit useful.\n\tSo December 15, 1998, I walked in the office on a Monday morning, there was an e-mail from the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Korea.  He said, “Mr. Schumacher, you recall that you said if we ever needed GSM 102, these credit facilities, send an e-mail.  Well, here is the formal request and the formal letter is coming in for 1.6 billion dollars of credit guarantees for us to buy food,” because Citibank cut them off and they couldn’t get open letters of credit.\n\tSo I walked into the Secretary’s office with my colleague, and said, “I’d like to do 1.6 billion dollars worth of credit to Korea.”  Back then, $1.6 billion was chunky.\nHe said, “Whoa, that’s a lot.”\n\tI said, “But I’m the President of the Commodity Credit Corporation, and, Dan, Mr. Secretary, you are the Chairman.  We have the authority to do this.”  Again, coming back to those key authorities.\n\tHe said, “Don’t you think we should talk to the President about this?”\n\tI said, “Let’s give John Podesta a ring and just run it by him.”\n\tSo he lifted up the red phone and said, “John, Gus and Dan.  Gus wants to do $1.6. billion. I think a billion dollars is more in the ballgame.”\n\t“It sounds good to me.  Do one billion dollars and then ratchet up to 1.6 dollars, send Gus and Chris out there, and then let’s get on with it.”  You know, boom, bang.\n\tAnd we did that in a period of days.\n\nQ:  That is amazing.\n\nSchumacher:  Better days.  We went out to Asia, we went to Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Jakarta, and Korea, and then buttoned down all the deals right after Christmas.  So it didn’t take us very long at all.  We did about 3 billion dollars worth of guarantees and food aid to help mitigate the impact of the financial crisis in Asia, and I was very proud of that.\n\nQ:  When you did something like that, were you careful to stay in touch with the press as well about what was going on?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.  We kept the press fully informed, but there was Christmas and they were interested in the financial side more than the food aid side.  They were interested.  They reported it.  The press that really reported it were the Australian press, because they were asleep at the switch, and so we went into Indonesia.\n\nQ:  With regard to agriculture?\n\nSchumacher:  Oh yes.  They discovered what we did afterwards and went absolutely bananas.  We basically took half the wheat market in Indonesia away from the Australians by getting out there and providing GSM 102, and so there was a bit of a to-do.  The prime minister called my colleague, Chris Goldthwait, “An avaricious looter in the floor of the Parliament,” and so I responded publicly, “While the Australians were sleeping on the beach, we were sleepless in Seoul.”  And that got into the press a little bit.  It was fun.\n\nQ:  When you left that job, how did you see your future?\n\nSchumacher:  First I took six months off just to kind of think what I wanted to do, and then I decided I didn’t want to become a lobbyist or go into a corporation, so I started working with the Kellogg Foundation part-time as a consultant.\n\nQ:  How did you pinpoint them as the logical—\n\nSchumacher:  I don’t know.  They sort of found me through—I don’t quite know it all worked out back in 2002, and we worked out that I would help them find opportunities for them to do grant making in small farmers, mainly focusing on refugee farmers.\n\nQ:  But that must have been your emphasis, not theirs.\n\nSchumacher:  It was mine, but then I got them interested, because it was a very fast-growing place where they could really make an impact.  If they would put up a few grants, we could go back to USDA and have them put more credit guarantees and HSS, just using, again, the authorities that existed to help minority small farmers get their feet on the ground.  That worked out very well.  We did a lot in that over a period of 2000 to 2008, and then we did a bit of work with some other foundations and then evolved into this Wholesome Wave Foundation with Michel Nischan.  So Michel and I got together over something called NAFI, the New American Farmer Initiative.\n\nQ:  What is that?\n\nSchumacher:  It was a group, an informal group, that would find interesting products from small refugee farmers and introduce chefs to them, and Michel would show them how to prepare these strange vegetables, and I’d find where they were, and then we’d develop a little co-op in Western Pennsylvania that would sell them to New York and Washington.  I’d brought some of the stuff down on the plane to Ten Penh restaurant in DC and sold it.  I think you wrote about it, actually.\n\nQ:  I did.  Let’s talk, though, about how things were changing in terms of the general public’s knowledge about food and agriculture at that time.\n\nSchumacher:  I think back in the nineties—well, back in the eighties, there was interest in food, but not in innovative food.  There wasn’t the food movement at the restaurants.  There was no Food Network.  I think during that time, in the late nineties and the early part of the twenty-first century, you had this Food Network exploding.  It didn’t exist very much.  People didn’t watch chefs pounding away at dead fish and cooking it.\n\tSo you had this intersection of interest in food, interest in agriculture.  Young people began to spend as much time thinking about their food system as about their environmental system.  So there was a lot of interest among the youth, whether they were in colleges or in high school, about eating healthier, about where their food comes from.  Their parents would be taking them to farmers’ markets.  So they grew up much more knowledgeable about food than certainly my generation or the generation that came after me.  The generation who were teenagers in the nineties became young adults in the twenty-first century, and they cared about food.  They’re the ones who really got interested in going to the farmers’ markets.\n\tI was a little surprised to see the numbers.  When I was Commissioner, we had maybe twenty, thirty markets in Massachusetts.  Now they have over two hundred.  Nationally, there was a thousand.  Now they have five thousand.  So there must be ten, twelve, fifteen million people that will go to buy local food on a weekly basis in the month of September.  That’s up from maybe five million or four million when I was commissioner, or even less.  But a lot of interest.\n\nQ:  That’s a change because of greater awareness about, I don’t know, the implications of what we eat?\n\nSchumacher:  Look at all the books and movies.  You’d never think of a popular food book in the airport.  I was coming back the other day from California, and Michael Pollan’s book is still up there among the bestsellers on the racks at the airport.\n\nQ:  In Defense of Food or the—\n\nSchumacher:  Both.  You have all these movies coming out, they’re not top sellers, but people go to watch them.  Then you have the Food Network with 75 million people watching them in a period of time.  You add the TV, you add reading, you add actually people walking with their own feet to a market and buying, you know, something is going on.  Then you add the restaurants, not all of them, but then you add the college dining rooms, who are more and more buying local, buying fresh, buying healthy.  Interesting.\n\nQ:  Do you have any thoughts about why young people got so involved in these issues?\n\nSchumacher:  I don’t.  It would be something for somebody to really think through and do surveys of why someone in their now forties, who were young adults in the eighties, would have a different view of food than someone now who’s in their late teens, early twenties, young adults who are flocking to these markets.  Like the Arlington farmers’ market here in Arlington on a Saturday morning, you can’t move with all the strollers.  Those are people in their late twenties and early thirties, piling their babies into the strollers and schlepping off to the farmers’ market.  I didn’t see that back in the eighties.\n\nQ:  I was going to say roll that back ten or twenty years, and that would have been unheard of it, wouldn’t it?\n\nSchumacher:  They would have been sleeping in or taking the kids to the supermarket and putting them in a supermarket cart with their feet sticking out the front or the back.  Now they put them into a stroller to go to the farmers’ market and put all the plastic bags on the edge of the stroller and push it through the market.\n\nQ:  How else did you envision spending your time, besides acting as a consultant to the Kellogg Foundation?\n\nSchumacher:  I think the Foundation could make a difference.  An innovative foundation like Kellogg or Kresge, now Wholesome Wave, you can be pretty nimble, and then you can explain to government how some of this stuff works and say that’s pretty interesting, again, using the authorities.  So I tried to really do what I call coalitions between foundations and government entities.  One of them was the Farmers’ Market Consortium, where we’d bring in anybody in the federal government of any department interested in farmers’ markets with foundations and just sit together once every three months and kick ideas around.\n\nQ:  You did that after you left government?\n\nSchumacher:  After I left government, yes.\n\nQ:  So under the aegis of the Kellogg Foundation?\n\nSchumacher:  The Kellogg Foundation, right.  So we had the Ford Foundation and the Kellogg Foundation would come, plus other foundations, and we’d sit around a table at USDA for two or three hours every three or four months and just kick some ideas around.  We’d then jointly host meetings in the countryside.  It’s been very productive.  It’s been an interesting exchange of ideas in a non-threatening way, because we can do things they can’t.\n\nQ:  “We” meaning?\n\nSchumacher:  The foundations.  But we don’t have the money to do a major initiative.  We might be able to do a million dollars a year in helping farmers’ markets so they can do 5 to 10 million dollars a year in helping farmers’ markets, if Congress passed the laws, and they did.\n\nQ:  Were you and have you been fairly active in lobbying Congress to help this happen?\n\nSchumacher:  Well, first of all, you can’t lobby as a foundation consultant.  You can advocate and educate.  If you lobby, then that’s a whole different rule.  Foundations are not allowed to lobby.\n\nQ:  Ultimately, what’s the difference between advocating and educating and lobbying?\n\nSchumacher:  Lobbying is asking for change in policy or regulation and then submitting legislation to change legislation or policy.  Informing and educating is basically saying what you’re doing and “Don’t you find of that of interest?”  Keeping Congress informed of what you’re doing is different than asking them to change a law to carry out the policy.\n\nQ:  What else have you been doing?  I know you’ve been doing a great deal.  But in addition to the Kellogg work.\n\nSchumacher:  Mainly focusing on the Wholesome Wave Foundation.\n\nQ:  I mean before Wholesome Wave, because we’ll get to that.\n\nSchumacher:  I do a bit of work with the Kresge Foundation, the Kellogg Foundation, and Roots of Change.  It’s a small foundation that does charitable work in California, and they were very innovative in California.  I like California because it’s so big, and they have such difficulties with the urban-rural connections.  We helped a little bit to bridge  those gaps.\n\nQ:  At Wholesome Wave, you work with Michel Nischan.  How did the two of you meet?\n\nSchumacher:  We were actually introduced by Michael Batterberry.  He knew Michel from Food Arts days and what he was doing with Heartbeat Restaurant and his innovations, and Michael was very supportive of young chefs who were doing innovative things, you know, the Danny Barbers, the Michel Nischans, the young chefs in their late twenties, early thirties, who were innovative.  He would write about them and reach out to them around the country.\n\nQ:  Innovative in the sense of?\n\nSchumacher:  New ideas of cooking.  Danny Barber was very interested in buying local and preparing great meals, and then he went up to Stone Barns and then grew his own food.  Michel, basically, Heartbeat, very healthy food, local, prepared very fresh.  Heartbeat, keep your heart going, so the heart-friendly food.  So Michael found that of interest.  Then I guess he read some of the stuff, or maybe you introduced me to it.  I don’t quite know how that all came about.  So we had lunch down here at 10 Penn, I think it was.\n\nQ:  You and Michael Batterberry?\n\nSchumacher:  I think you were there.\n\nQ:  I don’t know.\n\nSchumacher:  I think you were kind of responsible.\n\nQ:  I’m a little bit confused about time in terms of—\n\nSchumacher:  That was 2001.  Actually, I had met Michael Batterberry years ago when I was Commissioner, and we had lost touch with each other.\n\nQ:  It was before the effort to get immigrant farmers’ products to restaurants.\n\nSchumacher:  Right.  I don’t know how we met.  Then I think he assigned, 2002, 2003, Marian Burros to write a story in Food Arts about my work as commissioner some years ago, and then we get to be friendly.\n\nQ:  Michel was at Heartbeat, and was it that the hotel did not want to support it any longer?  What happened with that?\n\nSchumacher:  As far as I can understand, and Michel is very careful about saying this, but what I’ve heard is that he was buying—in chefdom, you need to keep your food cost 28 to 30 percent of your budget, that’s sort of the standard, and he was doing that.  He was keeping food costs reasonably and he was making money for the hotel.  But then they brought in some nice person, or not-so-nice person, who decided to take over and had a contract with Sysco for the other hotels.\n\nQ:  The other hotels.  W was part of—\n\nSchumacher:  W Starwood group.  So Sysco Food Service was supplying the other hotels, and this was the only one they weren’t supplying a full range of product, because Michel was making money for them, keeping costs at 30 percent or lower, and yet Sysco wanted that business.  So they apparently went to this woman or this person and said, “We want that business, and we can shave you a point if you let us in.”\n\tSo Michel said, “I’m outta here.”  Quit.\n\nQ:  That was a very unusual position for a chef to take, wasn’t it?\n\nSchumacher:  To quit?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.  He said, “It’s my values.  I’m outta here.  I’m gone.”\n\nQ:  I know we’re talking about him, not you at this point, but then how long was it before he reestablished himself in Connecticut?\n\nSchumacher:  He did some consulting work and then, as most chefs do, they’ll do some consulting work at that level, and then find the next nice restaurant to run.  So he and Paul Newman then connected in some fashion, and then he opened up this restaurant in Paul Newman’s Playhouse, which I think he still runs.\n\nQ:  And all along, you and he were in connection?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.  He’d speak at some of the Kellogg functions.  I would invite a lot of the young chefs to come to the Kellogg functions and introduce them to a lot of these farmers.  Danny Barber would turn up.  Michel would turn up.  It was kind of a lively period.  I was on the advisory board of Stone Barns to get that going, so there was a lively kind of exchange of, again, what I was doing as Commissioner, but only on a little more national basis with some of the younger chefs who were experimental.\n\nQ:  Was Kellogg, however, providing you with a sort of financial base for part of it?\n\nSchumacher:  Some, yes.  I wasn’t able to earn a full-time living, so I did some other things, but Kellogg at that period from 2002 to basically 2008 was my sort of main work.  Now I’m kind of doing some other things.\n\nQ:  Before we go on with the foundation, though, when you left the USDA, you could, however, have looked for another job.\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.\n\nQ:  But you didn’t go in that direction.\n\nSchumacher:  Boring.\n\nQ:  I see.  [laughs]  I see.  But one could also say this was more educational and sort of good works approach then.\n\nSchumacher:  Just enjoyable.  I wouldn’t use the word “good works.”  I just happened to enjoy doing what I did at the World Bank.\n\nQ:  How would you describe doing what you did?\n\nSchumacher:  Here’s an example.  I had to go to my nephew’s wedding in California this weekend, so I said, “I think I’ll go to San Diego first, fly out a few days earlier, then go to Sacramento and spend three or four days finding out what’s going on,” and looking at these San Diego farmers’ market, looking at the refugee program, talking to a lot of the innovative people that were doing work, meeting some bunch of farmers who were refugees, talking to people supporting them, talking to public officials, having some meetings, then flying up to Sacramento and reporting on what I found in San Diego to the Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, and then working with the WIC director and see if we couldn’t get more food into the WIC program and getting her flavor what was happening.\n\nQ:  But none of this was official? \n\nSchumacher:  Not in a government sense, but there was part of my work with Wholesome Wave and other groups, Kresge and some of the work I’m doing with the foundations.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you explain what Wholesome Wave is.\n\nSchumacher:  Well, before we start that, the fun part is basically focusing on what’s going in the United States.  I have a lot of interest in Europe and working in emerging markets and Africa and Afghanistan and Iraq and all the problems in that area, but I did that for thirty years.  Getting on a plane and going to Nairobi was okay, but that was a long time ago.\n\tI think we haven’t paid enough attention to what’s going on in this country.  We’re putting enormous resources overseas, whether it’s military or aid or other programs, and we haven’t reinvested in our own infrastructure, in our own agriculture, in our own technologies to help the small and medium-sized farmers here.  So I thought, well, if the government’s not going to do it, then I’ll work in foundations and then bring a little pressure on the government to do a little bit more of this work.  That’s, I guess, the theme of what I did 2001 to current.  Can you do some innovative work in my own country, traveling around to all different parts of the country, meeting farmers, meeting advocates, meeting people who are interested, meeting financiers and other foundations, and put some programs together to assist not only refugee farmers, but small farmers and looking at those kinds of options.  That’s been very rewarding.\n\nQ:  You did this consciously, I don’t mean rejecting big job offers, but consciously choosing a life that was not going to make you a lot of money.\n\nSchumacher:  Well, my wife still works, let’s put it that way.  We survive.  We’re not buying used cars, but we’re not buying fancy cars.\n\nQ:  How did Wholesome Wave come about?  Why don’t you explain what it is set up to do.\n\nSchumacher:  Paul Newman approached Michel Nischan and said, “Michel, why don’t you go out and be a little more aggressive about where you locate this food.” \nMichel said, “One of the best things is to put a farmers’ market of the Westport Playhouse.”  That was three, four or five years ago.\n\nQ:  Why was Paul Newman interested in that?\n\nSchumacher:  I don’t know.  He was very interested in local.  Remember Newman’s Organic, Newman’s Own.\n\nQ:  But that was his daughter, primarily, wasn’t it?\n\nSchumacher:  Daughter, but he went along with it.  He liked fresh local healthy food, and that’s why he encouraged Michel to run this restaurant, where basically 80 percent of the food was bought—his food costs must have been 35, 38 percent, ten points above what the normal was, and then he’d work it out with the—I don’t know if it was in terms of the lease or how they all worked it out where they would make some money, not a lot, but make some money by featuring healthy local food, [unclear] on a farmers’ market in Westport, which became one of the most successful markets in Connecticut.  They had to move it down the street because it was so successful.  The parking.\n\tThen he got interested in just how do you scale up this a little bit.  So he and I were chatting about it, and so we formed this little group with a little bit of money from Paul Newman, and we decided we’d focus on how do the underserved access food in difficult areas, whether it’s rural or urban.  We looked at a number of different ways of doing that and settled on improving marketing and access, bringing food procured regionally and locally into an underserved neighborhood and selling it at a fair price.\n\nQ:  So Wholesome Wave, that is what it is trying to do actively, is improving market access in these underserved areas?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.  We call it nourishing neighborhoods in areas that do not have adequate access to fresh food, fresh healthy food.  So we were doing a lot of academic work, and we said that’s not our gig.  We’re actually going to go out and do it, and if we make some mistakes, so be it.  So we started setting up farmers’ markets in Connecticut in difficult areas and discovered that we needed to basically provide incentives, because even procuring locally, the food was expensive.  So we provided vouchers or coupons to cut the product cost in half to low income consumers.  Then we got a lot of interest by low-income people who could afford to come.  So we started in South Norwalk.\n\nQ:  Such as the WIC vouchers?\n\nSchumacher:  Right.  But only doubling it, so if you used your food stamp card or your WIC vouchers and you went to a farmers’ market in Norwalk or Bridgeport or Holyoke or San Diego, you presented your WIC voucher for ten dollars, we’d give you twenty dollars in tokens.  Or you swipe your EBT card at a wireless machine for ten dollars, and we give you twenty dollars in tokens to shop at any of the farmers’ markets for fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nQ:  But that required coordination with the officials at the WIC program, yes?\n\nSchumacher:  Oh yes, and especially the food stamp program.  You had to go and get special permission.  You had to write a letter getting a waiver for a whole variety of legal reasons.  The WIC was okay, but the food stamp program was a lot more regulatory.\n\nQ:  By its very nature?\n\nSchumacher:  By the rules that the USDA set.  They did not want you to give incentives to buy a particular food, because if you did that regularly, Coke could give incentives to buy Coke, or Twinkies would give you half off to buy Twinkies, and so I think it was a fair regulation, and they’ve been very flexible about signing those letters.\n\tSo it’s worked out very well.  We were in four states in 2008, and it went very, very well.  Now we’re in twelve states in 2009 at fifty-six farmers’ markets, and we’re hoping to do twenty states next year at a hundred farmers’ markets.\n\nQ:  At these fifty-six farmers’ markets providing what, just to be clear?\n\nSchumacher:  That we will provide, let’s say, to the Abingdon Virginia Farmers’ Market, which is way down in southwest tobacco area of Virginia, we provided, I think, $20,000 and they then bought a wireless EBT machine.  We would give them technical assistance, we hired a consultant to give them advice, and then we gave them $15,000 where they could then match food stamps, WIC and seniors at the farmers’ market.\n\nQ:  These are not enormous sums.  They’re very important, but is the budget of the foundation such that you want to do targeted projects to get the most for your contribution?  How would you describe it?\n\nSchumacher:  We’re not actually a foundation.  We have some underpinning money, but we don’t have an endowment.  We’re called a charitable foundation, where we have to raise money.  The Newmans give us money every year and others do, and then we just raise a relatively small, five, six, eight hundred thousand dollars a year, and then give a chunk of that away to these markets.\n\nQ:  So that your overall budget is?\n\nSchumacher:  Modest, but it’s highly leveraged.  Like in Boston we gave $10,000—\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nSchumacher:  Ten thousand dollars to The Food Project in Boston, and they raised 50,000, 100,000 dollars in Boston. Same thing in San Diego.  So we would give 10,000 or 15,000 dollars to San Diego, and they’d go to the county offices and local foundations and double that, triple that.\n\nQ:  Like a matching grant, sort of?\n\nSchumacher:  More than matching.  They would triple up, because these people enjoyed the project.\n\nQ:  And that’s the condition of giving—\n\nSchumacher:  Not necessarily.  It just happened to work out.  In Rhode Island they would generate a lot of money from healthcare foundations.  So it seems to be growing very rapidly.  Michelle Obama mentioned it, to my amazement, in her speech the other day.\n\nQ:  What did she refer to?\n\nSchumacher:  She called it the “double-dollar” program, which I thought was fascinating that she would even mention it.  Then the Department of Agriculture is well aware of it.  The question is, can we find money in the federal government to do double vouchers.  That’s going to be interesting.\n\nQ:  You are, I can’t remember, president, chair?\n\nSchumacher:  I’m chairman, yes.\n\nQ:  Why isn’t it a foundation?  That confuses me.\n\nSchumacher:  Because a foundation has to have an endowment.  Like the Kellogg Foundation has its own money in the stock market, and we are more of an operating foundation.  To get a million dollars in revenue, you’d need, what, 20 million dollars in the bank, 75 percent.  Some just send us checks.  Anonymous donors will send us a check for $150,000.  Others we write a proposal for.  We’re an operating foundation, they call it, a charitable foundation.\n\nQ:  Is that how you describe yourself, as an operating foundation or a charitable foundation?\n\nSchumacher:  Right, it’s called the Wholesome Wave.  I think the legal title is the Wholesome Wave Charitable Ventures Foundation. .\n\nQ:  A mouthful.\n\nSchumacher:  It’s the legal term to differentiate it from Ford, Rockefeller or others.\n\nQ:  Do you spend half-time there doing that work, whole time?\n\nSchumacher:  I’m spending more time than I should.  It’s non-paid.  I get a little expense money when I travel, but I’m probably spending three-quarters of my time right now with it.  But it’s all right.\n\nQ:  And you’re traveling to educate yourself, to see what’s going on?\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.  When I flew up to San Diego, it’s one thing for them to write you a little note and saying what’s going on.  It’s a whole other thing to go out and actually talk to them, see what they’re doing, encourage them to write a little report.  I’ll send that to you.  “This is terrific stuff.  Write me a little report and I’ll circulate it, put some pictures in, describe what you’re doing.”  And these young people wrote a brilliant four-page report, pdf with all the pictures, and described precisely what we’re doing.  I sent that everywhere.  People were very excited about it.\n\nQ:  They were willing to give it to you because they knew you were connected?\n\nSchumacher:  Well, we fund it.  It was part of the requirement.  We said, “Help us describe what you’re doing so we can get you some more money.”\n\nQ:  What do you think your grandfather or father would think about what you’re doing now?\n\nSchumacher:  I don’t know.  Well, my father enjoyed coming to the farmers’ market, that’s for sure, because he grew up going to the markets, and then he sold to the supermarkets for many years, and he did not direct market.  My brother, when he bought a farm, he and I did direct marketing.  He did most of the work.  I did the coming up to the markets.  I think he’d be interested.  Sort of cycling back into how he started.  My great-grandfather, grandfather, and father sold from the 1870s till 1930, 1945 through farmers’ markets.  Then when the supermarkets came along, they then shifted and sold to Bohack and A&P, at First National.\n\nQ:  Is it, I guess, part of a chain that started with the kind of small farm that your grandfather and father worked on?  I don’t mean a chain like a supermarket chain.  I mean a chain of activity that seems to logically evolve out of.\n\nSchumacher:  I guess so, yes.  I think what I found is that when my father was selling, he never sold when we moved to Boston, a little bit to a roadside stands, but the kids would be given a wagon and go in the front of the house and sell carrots or corn off the front to the passer-bys.  But we never sold at a farmers’—there weren’t any farmers’ markets to sell to.  It was considered peddling.  In the early part of the last century, pushcarts in New York, Italian pushcarts going around Boston or New York, “Get your vegetables!  Get your fruit!” pushing the carts around, that was peddling, and you couldn’t make much money at that.  You could sell at a farmers’ market.  Probably sold to the peddlers to take it around.\n\tMy father, we would sell to the First National A&P truckloads of stuff.  I’ll show you some pictures downstairs, ten, twelve big trucks going off daily in the thirties to big supermarkets.\n\nQ:  But weren’t there farmers’ markets like a century ago or more, or were they technically not the same animal?\n\nSchumacher:  They weren’t quite the same animal.  I mean, they were basically markets where you would sell, bring your commission.  You’d come in, you’d park, and you’d sell.\n\nQ:  There was a structure, often.\n\nSchumacher:  There was a structure, always a structure, and you’d sell to people buying for small stores, very much what’s going on at Hunts Point now in New York.  You’d come in, there’d be a couple hundred commission men, so you’d sell your stuff there.  Then the Korean green grocers would come and buy.  Now that’s the main market.  They have a big Korean festival at the Hunts Point Market to the biggest customers, whereas the big California guys will ship trainloads or busloads or semis straight into Wal-Mart.  They never go to these places, or your big cities buy direct.\n\nQ:  What motivates you to do this work?\n\nSchumacher:  I just enjoy it.  Getting up at six-thirty, seven o’clock and going to a consulting firm and doing work for a big corporation on how to improve the market for Hostess Cupcakes, not quite what I—that’s okay.  Some people love it, but not me.\n\nQ:  So what’s next for you?  Continuing this work for Wholesome Wave, or you know not what’s next?\n\nSchumacher:  I don’t know.  I mean, let’s see what—I think this Wholesome Wave thing is pretty interesting.  We’ll see how this would continue for the next few years, and see what comes over the transom.  But I just enjoy visiting and learning about the changing structure of American agriculture.  Who is growing our food?  Is the crisis in transportation a year and a half ago encouraging people to grow more in the East?  What are the technologies?  Will the demand for better nutrition encourage more production throughout the country?  There’s very little vegetables or fruits grown in Mississippi.  They have the highest rate of diabetes in the country in Mississippi.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.  I didn’t know that.\n\nSchumacher:  There’s no small vegetable farmers in Mississippi.  Down in the Southeast, you look at Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, you’re getting big farms with big orange groves, but you don’t have the thousands of small farmers that you have in New England growing mixed crops for direct consumption.  It’s just simply not part of their tradition in those places.  Well, can we work on that?  Can foundations give money to put up high tunnels to grow food throughout the winter?  Can we put up more farmers’ markets?  Can we use vouchers?\n\nQ:  And Wholesome Wave would be involved in that?\n\nSchumacher:  We are involved in that, yes, and Kellogg is involved in that.  Then try and get the government involved in that as well.  So we shall see.  This is a different administration.  They’re very interested in nutrition, local food, regional food systems.  Can we work with them a little bit?\n\tIn New York City, a former director named Tom Frieden, now head of the CDC—that would be a wonderful interview, if you can do an interview with him in public and political.com or something.  Where is his direction?  He started Health Bucks in New York, where poor people get Health Bucks, like we’re doing in Wholesome Wave, and go to the farmers’ markets.\nWill CDC expand that kind of a program?  With their millions and millions of dollars, will they promote healthy food by going to a local food system, or will they just encourage people to eat healthier by shopping on the edge of the supermarket rather than the middle?  It’s all up in the air.  But you can’t shop at the edges unless you have some other increase in food stamps or incentivize food stamps to eat healthier.  That’s the great battle I think is going to be occurring, is between the hunger advocates, which are very powerful, and the nutrition advocates, which are less powerful.  People feel that if people are hungry, they’re pouring money into food stamps and into school lunch and after-school meals, but not looking at the nutritional content of all that food, whereas a bunch of us over here are looking at, okay, let’s incentivize, keep the money there, but incentivize free programs that will create healthier food system.\nSo we shall see.  But they say the tree falls in the forest and no one reads about it, then the tree didn’t fall.  Right?  So, I mean, one of the things we’re doing is we’re making sure that our partners, like in Chicago there may be a front-page story on our—\n\nQ:  What kinds of partners do you mean?\n\nSchumacher:  The grantees.  We don’t put the press releases out; they do.  We have them put together and we’ll talk to them.  There’s a woman named Monica Eng, who I don’t know, is a food writer, apparently, in the Chicago Tribune and is going to be coming out this week with a major front-page story on this program.  She’s managed to go from the food section occasionally to the front page and then linked to the food section, on why the city of Chicago is not doing more to promote healthy local food for food stamps.\n\tSo she’s been calling up—well, here’s an example.  They called and wanted to know who else was doing this, so I was able to refer her to three or four of our projects.  My name will not be in any of this stuff.  The people in San Diego and others called back and said, “We did a wonderful interview with someone named Monica Eng on what we’re doing.”  She might not put much in it, but the fact that they would call, it’s exciting for these young people.  The Chicago Tribune calls Andrea McGee in City Heights, San Diego. “How are you doing?  What are you doing?”  She’s excited about that.  People have egos.\n\nQ:  You, obviously, are excited, too, so that’s wonderful.\n\nSchumacher:  Well, I’m excited for a different reason, that from a policy perspective it strengthens the story to have verification from people who are already doing it successfully.  So this just started Saturday in Chicago.  Well, here’s City Heights San Diego, Fresh Farm Rhode Island, that has been doing it for a year or two very successfully, doubling the use of food stamps at farmers’ markets and people coming in very enthusiastically to do this stuff, and they can just give verification to that.  That’s important for a reporter to—is this stuff for real?  Reporters need to check this stuff out, and so you’re going to check your sources.  Is this stuff going to work?\n\nQ:  Before we end, do you know what percentage of farmers’ markets in the country food stamps can now be used?\n\nSchumacher:  In about 800 farmers’ markets out of 5200, so about 18 percent.\n\nQ:  But two years ago?\n\nSchumacher:  A hundred.  In Massachusetts, the governor just gave $50,000 to put EBT machines in every farmers’ market in Massachusetts next year, which is kind of cool.\n\nQ:  That’s very exciting.\n\nSchumacher:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Thank you very much.\n\nSchumacher:  Is that all right?\n\nQ:  Absolutely.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSchumacher - 2-  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n","description":"High-level government employees are rarely known for sharing information with outsiders. It can be particularly difficult to get answers to questions about agricultural economics or the American food system. Yet Gus Schumacher, the only farmer in the Harvard class of 1961, has always considered educating the public (and the U.S. Congress) an essential and enjoyable part of his role.\r\n\r\nAs Commissioner of Agriculture of Massachusetts, Administrator of the Foreign Agriculture Service, and then Undersecretary of the Farm and Foreign Agriculture Service at the USDA in the Clinton administration, Schumacher consistently found ways to spread the word. He educated reporters; regularly spoke on the farm radio network; facilitated conversations between journalists, political officials, farmers, and agricultural economists; and was always available to explain a new law or regulation or Farm Bill.\r\n\r\nSince he left government in 2007, Schumacher has continued that pattern as a consultant. Assisting and enabling new farmers - immigrants, women, young people - is one of his passions. Currently Schumacher is also the president of Wholesome Wave, a Connecticut-based charitable foundation that has been particularly active in finding ways to help the needy purchase nutritionally-rich produce at farmers markets at discount rates.","identifier":"gus-schumacher","label":"Gus Schumacher","url":"/interviews/gus-schumacher/index.html","name":"Gus Schumacher","sort":"schumacher","handle":null},{"@search.action":"upload","content":"Mimi Sheraton is a writer, critic, and cookbook author perhaps best known for her transformational work as a restaurant critic at The New York Times from 1975 to 1984.

This is Judith Weinraub.  I am with Mimi Sheraton at her home in Greenwich Village.\nGood afternoon.\n\nSheraton:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  Could we start, please, by your telling me something about where and when you were born and something about how you grew up, what your parents were like, what they were doing.\n\nSheraton:  I was born in Brooklyn, in Midwood section of Flatbush, in 1926.  I had one brother.  My parents, Beatrice and Joseph Solomon.  My mother born in Brooklyn, my father in London and came here when he was an infant, so they grew up and went to school here and so on.  My father was in the wholesale fruit and produce business and came home a great deal talking about his work and the produce that came in, and what was better than what.  My mother considered cooking probably the most important thing a woman should be good at, so there was a great deal of talk about cooking.  She cooked a lot.  Whenever I wanted to see her, she was in the kitchen, so I picked up a lot of interesting food.  We lived in a nice house with a garden.\n\nQ:  Where did she learn to cook?\n\nSheraton:  I think she just learned from her mother and taking off on herself.  My parents were descended from Ashkenazi Jews, but they were not kosher, although their parents were.  We lived not too far from Sheepshead Bay, and my mother made a great deal of shellfish, oysters, clams, lobsters, all of that.  We were not kosher in any way.  She cooked everything, and in addition to that Eastern European Jewish cooking, she did a great deal of what was then American cooking, recipes torn out of the newspapers.  She was very social; she had a lot of people over for luncheons and card parties.  So she tried a lot of dishes and baked a lot of things.  She made what I think of as Fannie Farmer-era American cooking.  She was very active in all kinds of groups.\nI went to public school, public elementary school, Midwood High School, and then I went to New York University.\n\nQ:  Let me take you back for a second.  Your father worked at the Washington Market?\n\nSheraton:  Yes. \n\nQ:  What was that like?\n\nSheraton:  It was fabulous.  There are small remnants.  When I go down to the restaurants now, I recognize some of the sheds and some of the loading platforms, especially around restaurants like the Tribeca Grill and a few of those.  It’s very much of a night business.  The trucks would come in with the produce from all the farm areas in the United States and begin to pull in twelve, one o’clock in the morning.  The market really became very busy three, four o’clock, as far as the buying and selling.  Then in the daytime when my father was there, you had all the accounts to take care of.  But he would get there very early, six, seven in the morning.\nSometimes when my mother and father would take me to New York to see a play or go to a restaurant, on the way back to Brooklyn—we would drive, and on the way back to Brooklyn, my father would say, “I want to stop in on the street and see what’s going on.”  And that was always a very glamorous time because there was loads of activity, people shouting and yelling and all the lights were on.  If it was winter, there were fires in the oil drums to keep warm.  I loved that scene.  I think that’s where I got to love night markets like Tsukiji in Japan and the fish market I went to in Ancona, because these people are up and awake and doing their food thing while the whole city is asleep.  It’s like a secret society.  At the end of the day, they would go to restaurants for dinner, and they would maybe have some chops and a steak at eight o’clock in the morning, and then go home.\nI can remember when the Fulton Fish Market was in full swing, Dick, my husband, and I would sometimes go to a restaurant called Sloppy Louie’s that was for market men and closed after lunch.  We would go at eight in the morning and have bouillabaisse and softshell crab.  It was very rough bouillabaisse; it was really fish soup.  It was very, very elementary.  Then we’d take off for the day and drive out to Buck’s County or somewhere.\n\nQ:  Where was Sloppy Louie’s?\n\nSheraton:  Sloppy Louie’s was on South Street, right opposite the Fulton Fish Market.  It was around the corner from where Sweet’s was.  I don’t know if that was Pike Street or just what that street is, but we can find an address for Sloppy Louie’s.  I have many old restaurant guidebooks.  As I say, it closed at two o’clock in the afternoon, so it was breakfast and lunch.  There were a lot of markets like that.  The Old Homestead.\n\nQ:  I don’t know about that.\n\nSheraton:  That’s on Ninth Avenue near Fourteenth Street.  It still exists.  It’s a steakhouse, and there used to be steak breakfasts there because that’s the center of the meatpacking district, so the wholesale butchers would get done at that time and go in for a steak.  My father worked there before he went to fruit and produce, before I was born, in fact, in the wholesale poultry market, so he knew both markets, but most of the time he was what was called a commission merchant.\n\nQ:  I’ve heard that, but I couldn’t figure out what that meant.\n\nSheraton:  It’s a very exciting occupation.  I don’t know if it still works that way.  A commission merchant sold a farmer’s crop on commission, but what it also meant is the experts—in this case, my father and some of the people he worked for—would go to the farms before the planting season.  They would get to know—and they never called them farmers; they were called growers.  They went to see the growers to see if they were reliable, to see if they had the land, unless they had worked with them before.  Remember, this was the Depression.  So they would advance them money for seed and to get through the next year’s crop, and therefore contract for that crop if they were not fields that they owned.  Some commission merchants owned fields.  People like D’Arrigo, which is Andy Boy, they would have the fields and the distributorship at that time.  I’m not sure if Sunkist had an outlet here.  And different commission merchants specialized in different vegetables and fruits, generally.\nMy father did a lot with the Imperial Valley, in Salinas and around there in California and Florida, Georgia.  Georgia peaches.  Florida grapefruit.  He never thought Florida oranges were very good; he thought California oranges were better.  But he bought Florida grapefruit.  [laughter]  This is what I heard all the time, growing up.  It was just the dinner table conversation.  No apples from the West Coast; they’re terrible.  You need apples from New York and Massachusetts, where it gets cold at night.\nHe hated what we used to call steamer basket fruit, if anybody remembers what a steamer—well, a steamer was an ocean liner, and when a friend went on a big trip, people would send baskets of fruit to their stateroom so they would have fruit for the voyage, I guess, and not get scurvy.  [laughter]  And they were very elaborate.  You see gift baskets now.  But they were what my father called hothouse fruit.  They were big and gorgeous, but tasteless.\n\nQ:  Even then.\n\nSheraton:  Even then.  Absolutely.  And there were a lot of places that specialized.  There was one in Brooklyn, very famous, in downtown Brooklyn, called Ekleb & Geyer, very, very fancy shop for steamer basket fruit.\nHe would talk about the buyers from the different restaurants or food stores who wanted everything choice, who not only wanted to pick the box of fruit, but they wanted to open the box and pick the fruit.  The buyer from Longchamps Restaurant and the buyer from Gristede’s at that point I remember particularly.\n\tThen the other part of it that was interesting is that toward dawn, when the main part of the market was closed, six, six-thirty, pushcart people would come in to pick up the remains, because, as I said, this was the Depression and there were people going up and down the streets.  Even in our very nice residential section in Brooklyn, you could hear in the afternoon someone either with a cart or a truck, yelling, “Corn!  Watermelon!”  Street crying up and down.  My mother would go out of the house.  Other people would go out of the house.  “There’s a man with corn.  I think I’ll get some tonight.”\n\nQ:  These were things they paid for?\n\nSheraton:  They paid for, but they paid less because it was what was left over.  They got it cheap.  And also if my father or any other head of a company or salesman had sympathy for them, they would throw things in or, you know, they knew someone, something like that, but they paid for them.  This was also true, though it wasn’t that market, people would come through peddling fish.  A man might pick up a bunch of flounders in Sheepshead Bay or a fish market, and so down Twenty-ninth Street in Brooklyn, in the middle of the afternoon, “Flounder!  Flounder!”  It was street crying.  Some had horses and wagons and some were in trucks and some were in big, big hand pushcarts.\n\nQ:  This was the thirties?\n\nSheraton:  This was the thirties, yes.  I was born in ’26.  I’m sure it was going on through ’29, but I was not as aware of it, almost to World War II.  There were all kinds of street criers.  There was a knife sharpener who would come up and down.  Then there were several very famous cake and bread delivery places.  Dugan’s was one of the big names in New York.  What was the other one?  Just flew out of my head—I’ll think of it.  It begins with a K.  I’ll think of it.  And they had routes.  You knew the Dugan man was coming on a certain day and you knew what cakes he had that you liked, and then you knew what the other one would have.  And, of course, ice cream trucks came up and down.\nThis was not food, but there was the I Cash Clothes man.  Those were usually little Jewish men who had on heavy coats, even if it was summer, tied with a rope, big sacks on their back, and they would go up and down these quiet tree-lined streets of Brooklyn, yelling, “I Cash Clothes!  Buy old clothes!  I Cash!”  And the women would save things, because they knew it was about due for the I Cash Clothes man, and they would sell it very cheaply.  They got fifty cents, seventy-five, and he—God knows where they resold them.  But the streets were very busy with people doing all of those things.\nKrug was the other one, K-r-u-g.\n\nQ:  Did your mother actually buy things from these people peddling on the streets?  I mean food-wise.\n\nSheraton:  Food, yes.  She didn’t buy from the I Cash Clothes man; she sold.  Yes.  You know, you say, “Dinner’s coming.  Here’s fresh corn,” or, “Here’s watermelon.”  She would be inclined to do that more than fish, because fish she probably got in advance and so on.  But absolutely everybody ran out.  The women were home, you know.  Most of the women were home all day.\n\nQ:  Does this mean that your father had to lay out a lot of cash before each season?\n\nSheraton:  Yes, and then—this was a very exciting part—as the produce was ready to be delivered, was beginning to be trucked up, the prices in the market might change.  There might be a glut of string beans or a crop might have been rained out, and the prices changed all along the route.  The trucks would call in to my father all night long, because there were no cell phones.  They would have to stop.  And he would tell them, if string beans were a glut on the market in New York, he would say, “Dump them in Baltimore.”\n\nQ:  How fascinating.\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  And the four cities he was involved with were Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, New York.  So if it was a glut on the market and you had to sell them cheap, you sell them as close to the south, where you began, as you could.  Of if you were coming from the west, you sold it.\nMy father wrote two books about the business.  One was called The Railroad to Recovery, because he thought the railroad was the answer, rather than trucking, and he wrote another one, called Controlled Distribution of Fruits and Vegetables, that the distribution should be controlled so that the growers are not at the mercy of the market.  In both cases, Henry Wallace had him down to Washington to discuss the theories.  Henry Wallace was then the Secretary of Agriculture.  So he was very well known for those.  They’re very slim books.  I have just one.  I never was able to find the other.  But they were very important at the time.\nHe also wrote articles for—there were two newspapers for the fruit and vegetable business.  One was called The Produce News, and I think it was a weekly, and it was pink, the paper was pink, so it was known as the pink sheet.  They were, I believe, in the building that is Six Harrison Street, where Chanterelle is.  The editor was Al Haglund, and he was a graduate of the Columbia School of Journalism, and a very good friend of my father’s, who helped him with the editing of his books, and my father wrote some articles for that paper.  The other paper, which I think was a monthly—if The Produce News was a weekly, The Packer was a monthly.  If The Produce News was a daily, which I don’t think, then The Packer was a weekly.  The Packer was a more serious, bigger paper, printed on white.  Packer, meaning the food packer.\nThey were all down in Washington market, which was very exciting.  I mean, when I had a day off from school, my father would sometimes take me to the office and he’d work in the morning, we’d have lunch, then we’d go to Radio City Music Hall or something.  I loved being in the offices because they were like these houses, you know.  They were the little old Dutch houses that the market had just moved into, and they had these side staircases like brownstones, except they were very narrow and very steep, and the offices were all off these stairways.  There used to be lady bookkeepers at high desks, with green eye shades, and they used to give me rolls of adding machine paper.  I loved blank paper.  [laughs]  I don’t like blank paper so much now, but I always said, “I’m going to write a long, thin story,” on this adding machine paper.\nAnd the smell was wonderful, because it was wet orange crate wood, there would be some crushed vegetables underfoot.  If onions had come in, there was a faint warm whiff of onions.  I know I enjoyed it then, but I don’t know if I realized—I guess I didn’t—how much that was going to lodge in my memory for markets and night markets, which I wrote a whole book on markets for Harry Abrams, and I just never stopped going to them. \nYou don’t think, when you’re doing that, “This is going to be my profession,” because, first of all, what he was in was a man’s business, and it wasn’t until Frieda on the West Coast began going into it that women—you know Frieda?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nSheraton:  Frieda was a woman in the Los Angeles produce market—the company’s still there—who began to bring in, you may remember, sun chokes and also little teeny pearl onions.  She began to bring in all sorts of specialty exotic produce—Jerusalem artichokes, things that weren’t around here.  I visited her once in the L.A. market and did a story on her out there.  The business, I’m sure, still exists, because I think her daughter was in it.  But it was very unusual food.\n\nQ:  When would that have been?\n\nSheraton:  Well, when I was on the Times, and I was on the Times from ’75 to ’84, so somewhere in the middle.\n\nQ:  But her business started before then, no?\n\nSheraton:  I’m sure she was in the market because it was her father’s business she went into.  But around that time we all began to be aware of more exotic and unusual items, so whether she was in that aspect of the business before, I’m sure you can go on Google and find out the history of Frieda.  Marion Burros did stories on her; everybody did.\nBut it was unusual for women.  Now, the market here, Washington market, was primarily Italians and Jews.  There were a few Irish people, but my father worked for a big Italian company who had houses in Sheepshead Bay and grew their own tomatoes.  Jill Brothers was their name.  Frank Jill was one company and Jill Brothers was another.\n\nQ:  Gill with a G?\n\nSheraton:  J-I-l-l.  I’m sure it was J____ or something and they changed it.  And the Italians really understood the produce because they had come from farm areas, like the Balduccis came from farms who grew broccoli de rabe in Puglia, so when they came here, they understood that business.\nSo I grew up in this kind of food atmosphere, and my parents also.  I’m the older child by seven and a half years, so I was an only child for quite a while and got taken to a lot of restaurants with them.  They loved to go to restaurants.  We went to Lundy’s in Brooklyn, the famous Lundy’s, when it was still out on the water side of Sheepshead Bay.  It was out on a pier, on a dock, and then later moved to where it grew and where it folded and where there’s a ghostly building now on the other side of Emmons Avenue.  We ate all kinds of fancy things.\nMy father had very special ways of ordering in a restaurant.  If it was squab or softshell crabs in season, he would say, “Just bring me a big platter of those and no green stuff.”  You would think a man of—he hated vegetables.  So we learned to order a very different way.  We didn’t order a squab and a blue plate.  He ordered eight squabs, you know, and then some fried potatoes.  Again, it must have lodged in my mind, and they were great old restaurants they took me to.  If they had a wedding anniversary, we might go here to—first of all, there was The Lobster near Times Square, which was a great—and then there was a steakhouse called Fan and Bill’s, and I remember the specialty there.  I must have been six or seven.  Plank steak.  It was a Chateaubriand that came out on a plank, on an oval carved platter with a bordeur of mashed potatoes that had been glazed brown, and in between the potatoes and the steak, all kinds of vegetables, like sort of a della Robbia.\n\nQ:  Sounds great.  [laughs]\n\nSheraton:  Plank steak.  It was a very, very good thing in those days, as were Lundy’s and The Lobster, what were known as [unclear] dinners, which usually had half a chicken, half a lobster, clams, steamers, Manhattan clam chowder—Manhattan clam chowder always—corn.  And at Lundy’s, Huckleberry pie.  Not blueberry; huckleberry.  I can remember the kids used to get all excited about their tongues and mouths being purple, and you’d show your mother and she’d say, “What are we going to do?”  So those are random food memories of childhood, and I guess it always mattered to me.\n\nQ:  Did your mother enjoy going to these restaurants too?\n\nSheraton:  Oh, loved it, loved it, loved it.  And I always knew how to cook.  I can’t remember when I didn’t know how to cook something.\n\nQ:  She let you in the kitchen with her?\n\nSheraton:  I would do my homework, sit there while she was fixing dinner.  You know, you’d talk.  My grandmother, her mother, was a great cook and lived near us, and I would go to see my grandmother, and if she was making her special cookies that had chopped walnuts and cinnamon and sugar, I had the mortar and pestles here that I used there to crush the walnuts.  I have her mortar and pestles, two of them right on the shelf there.  My job was to crush the walnuts for these cookies and to help brush the egg on the challah if I happened to go there on Friday morning.  So without realizing it, food was everywhere.  As I did say in my book, my mother’s reaction to every special event was “Call the butcher.”  She just felt you had to have soup, you had to have tongue, and you had to have a brisket, because those things you could slice for anybody who came in hungry.  No matter how bad or how good things were, you had to have that.  So that was always what went on.\n\nQ:  It’s funny, I was here originally to go to graduate school—this was in the sixties—and my mother was extremely food-phobic, and for some reason—\n\nSheraton:  Food-phobic?\n\nQ:  Yes.  And for some reason, one of the first things I wanted to make was tongue.  [laughs]  I mean, I have no idea.  I must have watched my grandmother make it or something, but I wanted to make a sweet and sour tongue, which never had crossed the dining room table of my own home.  I guess they were there and they were really interesting.  You couldn’t buy anything like that now.\n\nSheraton:  We used to make tongue with sweet and sour cabbage.  We didn’t make sweet and sour sauce on the tongue, but we had sweet and sour cabbage or we had regular cabbage, like corn beef and cabbage, tongue and cabbage.  My mother made sweet and sour string beans and sweet and sour cabbage.\n\nQ:  So you always knew how to cook, but was your mother willing to share responsibility?\n\nSheraton:  I never really cooked at home unless she was away.  As I got older and a teenager, and my brother was seven and a half years younger, sometimes my parents would go away for a weekend and I would cook some little thing for my brother.  I never remember cooking a meal for my parents.  I made my own breakfast if I got up very early.  I could make eggs and toast and milk, not coffee.\n\nQ:  What did your parents look like?  Did they gain weight easily?  Did they not?\n\nSheraton:  My mother tended to be a little chubby.  My father weighed 135 pounds all his life.  He loved potatoes and he loved chocolate.  He could eat a five-pound box of chocolate at night, sitting there reading the paper, and any kind of potatoes and, of course, meat and fish.  Shellfish.  He was not big on vegetables other than corn or maybe sweet and sour vegetables, something like that.\n\nQ:  Did they have any concern about whether or not you would get fat?\n\nSheraton:  Not really.  I was a very bad eater as a child, and very skinny.\n\nQ:  You mean you didn’t eat much?\n\nSheraton:  And I threw up a lot.  I think they worried about, at a certain point before I remember or before I know I remember, they worried about me being too skinny, but that was never—my brother and I and my mother were all inclined to gain weight, so it’s been all my life a battle.\n\nQ:  You went to high school in Brooklyn and then what happened between high school and the School of Commerce?  Was that pretty direct?\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  I graduated high school and went to NYU School of Commerce, except that at the end of my sophomore year I eloped with someone I had been crazy about for about three years.  He came home from the Air Force, and I wanted to do something irrevocable, something that took me beyond the control of my parents.  [laughs]  At that time, the age of consent in New York was twenty-one, and I was only nineteen, so we went to Greenwich, Connecticut, where the age of consent was eighteen, and went before a judge and got married.  I moved to Greenwich Village because I felt I wanted to support myself, and I switched to night school.  My parents paid for the school and I paid—my husband worked—for our own living expenses.  So the last two years I finished at night.\n\tI got a job right away.  It was easy to get a job.  The war was just over.  We got married barely a month, maybe not even a month, after VJ Day.  You couldn’t find an apartment to save your soul.  You just pounded the streets, looking for an apartment.  The war, you could not get an apartment in New York.  People would read the obituaries and call Saturday night.  They’d get the Times, read the obituaries, and call and say, “Is this going to be a vacant apartment?”  And we just pounded the streets.\n\tOne day it was very hot and we went into a bar on Eighth Street, a bar I knew from college because all the kids went there, Ed Winston’s Tropical Bar and Grill.  We went in for a sandwich and a drink, and we said, “You don’t know of an apartment?”\n\tHe says, “Oh, yeah, around the corner, Mr. Sittenham has an apartment on Ninth Street.”  It was a one-room basement apartment right on the street, like My Sister Eileen, which was very romantic then.  It was furnished with horrible furniture, and we took it.  Seven East Ninth Street.\n\nQ:  What was the kitchen like?\n\nSheraton:  The kitchen was a tiny, tiny closet.  It had one of these three-burner stoves, one, two, three, with a little oven under it, except one burner was under the drainboard.  The sink was at right angles to the stove, and the drainboard came over one burner, and if you opened the door of that oven, you could not be in the kitchen.  You had to stand in the living room and bend around.  The refrigerator was in another little—it was like a room, but it was a big closet.  The refrigerator and the clothes closet and the dish closet was in this other little sort of room.  And a bathroom and a big front room like that one.  That’s where I began.\nI was a very ambitious cook.  I had already begun to read Gourmet.  I had a maiden aunt, a career woman, who lived with us for a few years when I was a kid at home between my grandmother’s death, who she had lived with, and her own marriage, and she was a very big career woman for her time.  She was a traveling saleswoman.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nSheraton:  And she was very modern.  Of course, when she wasn’t traveling, she commuted to her New York office.  Subways had very elaborate newsstands, and I remember she brought home an issue of a new magazine that she thought was beautiful, and it was Gourmet.  I began to read it.\n\nQ:  You were how old?\n\nSheraton:  I was fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, somewhere in there.  I was sixteen when we moved into that house.  We moved into that house on Pearl Harbor Day.  We were unpacking dishes in our new house on Pearl Harbor Day.  It was shortly before my sixteenth birthday.\n\tI read this, and it was just wonderful.  It still didn’t make me think I wanted to write about food, because whoever heard about writing about food?  Although the newspapers, the Brooklyn Eagle and the Sun and the World Telegram, we got like six, seven newspapers a day, had home economists doing recipes, and my mother tore a lot of them out.  I still have some.  It looks like a box of old cornflakes.  They’re all flaked apart and brown, but I still have some of her torn-out recipes for pogachas and cheesecake, little fancy things for company.\nQ:  But there must have been a disconnect between that as a career and—\n\nSheraton:  It was just something nice to read about, but I think it started my mind thinking of food in a lovelier way.  I can remember a particular day after I was married and moved into this basement apartment, and at one point I had a very good job at an ad agency, and they gave me the summer off so I could go to school and not lose any time and graduate summer school.  So it was a really hot day in July or August, and of course there was no air conditioning then, and we didn’t have a shower; we had only a bathtub.  I came home boiling.  And I had a new issue of Gourmet.  I got into a bathtub full of cold water and I began to read this story called “Yogurt and the Bulgarian Colonel.”  I have it upstairs.  I have a big collection of Gourmets from the forties.\n\nQ:  Oh, my lord.\n\nSheraton:  I’ve read it since.  I had never heard of yogurt.  We ate sour cream, but we didn’t know anything about yogurt.\n\nQ:  Let alone a Bulgarian colonel.  [laughs]\n\nSheraton:  Yeah, and the colonel.  Well, he was very famous.  Menshnikov, who discovered the bacteria, the yogurt bacillus.  I think his name was Menshnikov.\nI began to read this, and I wanted to taste yogurt.  At that time, Dannon was in stores, but of course it was all plain; there was no strawberry, raspberry.  Gristedes used to be a very fancy chain of food stores, full service, not supermarket, and there was one on University Place between Ninth and Tenth.  That’s where I shopped, and I bought a container of plain yogurt.  Well, I’ve always loved buttermilk and sour cream, so it wasn’t a leap.  I ate it mostly with vegetables.  It somehow never occurred to me to eat it with anything sweet.  Many years later when I was in Lebanon, I happened to mention to someone yogurt over sweet fruit, and they looked at me like I was crazy.  “You only eat it with salt.  We eat it with cucumbers.  We eat it with radishes,” which is still how I prefer it.  So I began eating Dannon’s plain yogurt.  And that “Yogurt and the Bulgarian Colonel,” I read it only recently because of something I was doing for a book, and I didn’t realize until rereading it now that the colonel was the man who discovered the bacillus, a Russian or in Bulgaria, something like that.  So, Gourmet.\nAnd I would make very exotic things from Gourmet in this ridiculous kitchen, where the only work surface was a small shelf my husband attached to the inside of the kitchen door.  It was a tray that he set on a frame, and that was the only workspace.  If I had to do something big, I’d pull over the dining table.  It was a gateleg table and I would pull it over near the kitchen and open it if I was going to roll out pastry, if you can imagine such craziness, when I worked all day, went to school at night, and then was trying to do this madness.\n\nQ:  That’s a lot.\n\nSheraton:  That’s a lot.  And the first Thanksgiving that I had the apartment—we moved in in September, October—I invited my mother, father, and brother for Thanksgiving.  And of course my mother was overwhelmed that I really got a turkey into this oven and I had to cook two things and then put them on top of two other things to keep them hot.  I had to wash the turkey in the bathtub.  Of course, it didn’t fit in the sink, and the water came down all over me.  You know.  But I did it, and it was not bad at all.  My mother brought the dessert.  She was famous for lemon meringue pie, so she brought lemon meringue pie.  And there’s your nineteen-year-old daughter a few months out of the house, doing creamed onions and string beans and candied sweet potatoes.\n\nQ:  Was she impressed?\n\nSheraton:  Oh yes.\n\nQ:  And surprised?\n\nSheraton:  Oh, my mother and father were just bursting with pride, absolutely, yes.\n\nQ:  So then you were working at the ad agency, is that right?\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  It was what was called a mat service.  This was an agency that dealt with small retail stores all over the country, and the illustrations were on little mats.  Remember those pink matrixes?  You used to have them at newspapers.  That’s what they printed from.  That’s what they printed from.  They were like pressed paper, pink, with the illustration.  So they had illustrations for every occasion, for jewelry stores, furniture stores, savings and loan associations, lumber companies, and they gave me the task of writing copy for the jewelry stores and the home furnishing stores.  You just batted it out.  You would get a request from the store, what they wanted for the month.  “I want a birthstone ad.”  “I want a wedding ring ad.”  “I want a silver ad.”  Or furniture, mattresses, clearing, and so on.\n\tWhen I did that several years and graduated from college, I wanted to get something else.  I went to an employment agency and they sent me to Good Housekeeping magazine, who was looking for a home furnishings copywriter in the decorating department.  That’s the job I got, and I had no idea what I was in for, because the woman in the department was very, very serious, about home furnishings departments on design.  She was a very serious decorator.  She succeeded Dorothy Draper, who had had the job before.  And all the offices in the Hearst Building on our floor were done in Dorothy Draper—cabbage roses everywhere.  The black lamps and the white sink vases on the lamps with the black shade.  The color scheme was magnolia leaf green, black, and white.  Plus pink roses, cabbage roses.\n\tI had a terrible time with it, because I didn’t know design.  If only I knew furniture stores, Joe Blow’s Furniture Store in Akron, Ohio.  But I learned.  In addition to writing the copy, you got to help out on the sets.  If it was a Christmas story, you wrapped packages.  I liked it, and I wanted to be a home furnishings editor.  So I went to the New York School of Interior Design at night and became a certified decorator, and went to Seventeen magazine as the home furnishings editor.\n\nQ:  You set out to find a different job?\n\nSheraton:  Yes, as an editor.  I shared the office with the food editor, and the test kitchen was attached.  In the beginning, I worked for her until they separated the departments.  I used to help her cook.  I have always been interested in cooking, as you can tell, and so I splashed around in the kitchen a lot with Beryl.  Then as a result of covering home furnishings, one of the very big fields in those days, believe it or not, was hope chests for teenagers.  Sterling silver flatware, china, glass, bed linens, blankets, and that was home furnishings, and also fixing up their rooms.\nSo I went twice a year to the Furniture Market in Chicago and Grand Rapids, and I went a couple of times a year—Seventeen was very good about this—to Scandinavia, because that was the time of Scandinavian design, plus I took a leave and took a three-month trip with my husband, my first husband, around Europe, and I was prepared to quit Seventeen if they didn’t let me take this trip.  They said, “We want you to go.  We’ll give you half salary.  Please call on our advertisers in your field.”  Spode, Wedgwood, Royal Dalton, Minton, Royal Copenhagen, Haviland.  So it made the trip wonderful, because all those people entertained me.  I had another reason for being there, which I have since felt you’ve just got to work when you travel or it doesn’t mean as much.  And I spent a lot of time in Scandinavia, got to love Scandinavian food, still do it here a great deal in fall and winter, and the food all over.\nSo when the food editor left Seventeen, the editor, who had become a very good friend of mine, Irene Kamp, said, “Why don’t you do that too.  It’s not such a big deal on Seventeen.”  So I was the food editor, the home furnishings editor, and I also did—magazines used to have shopping columns, you may remember.  I was the shopping column editor.\n\nQ:  And you were how old?\n\nSheraton:  Well, I got the job in 1949 and I was there until ’54.  I was born in ’26, so I was twenty-three when I got there.\n\nQ:  It’s a big responsibility.\n\nSheraton:  Then I felt that if I’m going to do home furnishings, I have to do it for a grown-up magazine, because it was limited to what you could do.  Seventeen, I don’t know about now, but the woman who invented it and was the editor a large part of the time I was there, Helen Valentine, sold it to Walter Annenberg as an idea.  He was the publisher, Triangle Publications.  That it was specifically for high school teenagers, and we had to keep in mind never to grow old with our audience, which was a temptation.  It’s like “Last year I wrote about sophomores, this year I’d better write about juniors.  I’d better write about going to college.”  We never went to college.  We never did your college room.  We never did clothes to take to college.  We might do how to apply, but we kept going back to the fourteen-year-old.  Otherwise, you lose your audience.  It was geared—I don’t know what this has to do with food, because I’m talking at random, but it was geared, obviously, to fashion, and teenage was a size.\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nSheraton:  You have misses size, women’s size, junior.  Teenage was a size that the magazine wanted to promote.  It was clothes cut to the not-quite-developed teen figure, as opposed to juniors, which are a little wider, a little broader, a little fuller.  It was a fashion niche that the fashion people at Seventeen tried very hard to advance, to make themselves unique to this market, and there were teen departments with clothes for teenagers.  That was not juniors, although they had to sell some junior clothes because there weren’t enough teen clothes to fill.  Juniors used to be sized in the odd numbers, three, five, seven, so on, whereas misses was two, four, six.  Teens were also two, four, six, but it was a teen six or eight or ten, and of course teen cosmetics.  Of course, in those days, girls didn’t wear a lot of heavy cosmetics, but still there were a lot of light things that advertised and so on.  That was the core.  And we carried more sterling silver flatware advertising than any magazine, more than Vogue, more than Ladies’ Home Journal, anything, because they wanted these kids to register their patterns.  I mean, it’s wild, but they did.\n\nQ:  Did you think of yourself as having a career?\n\nSheraton:  Oh yes.  Oh yes.  Always.\n\nQ:  How common was that among people you’d gone to high school with?\n\nSheraton:  Not very.  Not very.  And my parents always thought of me having—it was always, “What are you going to be when you grow up?”  Certainly my mother expected marriage, children.  I think given her druthers, she would have liked me to marry a rich doctor in Scarsdale and stayed home.  But it’s their own fault, because they said, “Are you going to be a doctor?”  Are you going to be a this?  There was never any question about college.  Not many of the girls I went to high school, even though who were brilliant and valedictorian, much smarter than me in school, because I was like B-plus, A-minus.  I never tried very hard.  A few things I excelled in.  There were a few subjects I really excelled in.  But the real machers in the school, it’s interesting to me that they have happy, fully lives, but they did not turn out to be very well known or distinctive in anything, which I found—because I was in awe of them.  I never thought I could aspire to—I was never a class president or things like that.  I think in high school, as I once said, I was Principal for a Day, I majored in boys.  [laughter]  That was my very big concern.\nBut I think, you know, getting married to someone who just came back from the army, who was going to go to school, I had to work, in a way, and the career took off and I loved it.  The magazine world, when I got to that, I had never dreamed of working for a magazine, and it has done more for my life.  I have learned more how to live in a way I think I would not have lived if I had not entered the magazine world of furniture and decorating and doing what I call collecting beautiful dreck.  I especially loved the art department in these magazines, because they always had beautiful little things, whether it was a stone they found or a Baccarat paperweight.  The kids in the art department always had these things and I caught the bug.  I’ve been collecting dreck every since.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Did you think of a career as something that you adamantly wanted to do, as just a natural outgrowth of who you were, or what?\n\nSheraton:  A career or this career?\n\nQ:  Any career.\n\nSheraton:  I wanted to be famous.  That’s it in a nutshell.\n\nQ:  How old were you when you realized that?\n\nSheraton:  How soon did I know what fame was?  [laughter]  I can never remember.  You know, I’ve often wondered about that, because it may have been an offshoot of something that gave me a feeling when I was a kid.  My father’s father was a very prominent rabbi in Brooklyn, and his brother was a very prominent physician, Rabbi Solomon and Dr. Solomon.  When I would go to someone’s house, a new kid, and meet them and they would say, “This is Miriam Solomon,” or Mimi Solomon, they would say, “Are you related to Rabbi Solomon?”  And I’d say, “Yes.”  I was so proud.  Or, “Are you related to Dr. Charles Solomon?”  “Yes.”  Of course, with Rabbi Solomon, he was the chief mohel at the Brooklyn Jewish Hospital, which was the place for Jews to be born, and almost every boy I went out with was circumcised by my grandfather, and my mother would ask that question as an icebreaker.  She would say, “Have you any idea who circumcised you?”  This is in a couple of my books.\nSo we were famous relatively, and the Solomons were well known in this tiny, tiny community in Brooklyn, and I think it gave me a feeling that somehow I was a little more special than the other people.  It wasn’t yet that you could get a seat in a difficult restaurant.  [laughter]  That came later.  Or what I have come to appreciate more is getting to see a doctor quickly.  Never mind the table in the restaurant.  You call a doctor, it’s important, they say three and a half weeks.  Now they see me right away.  [laughs]  So maybe that was it.  I don’t know.  But I really did want to be known.\n\nQ:  The jobs that you had before you much later got to the Times all seem to either encourage travel or allow you to travel.  How did you do that?\n\nSheraton:  I’m a schemer.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  And clearly it wasn’t natural.\n\nSheraton:  No.  I scheme.\n\nQ:  Why did you want to do that?\n\nSheraton:  Because I wanted to see the world.  That was another really, really obsession since geography classes.  We used to have those little steel engravings of the little far-off—I remember the place where copra comes from, always these little islands with tropical palms and suntanned natives.  One of the places, copra came soon.  I was never quite sure what copra was, but—\n\nQ:  Where was your first husband stationed during the war?\n\nSheraton:  He was in this country, in training.  He was young and he never went—\n\nQ:  So it wasn’t like he brought home European memories.\n\nSheraton:  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  We were married for ten years.  Nine, really.  Separated, then we got divorced a couple of years later.  I married Dick, and that’s when I began freelancing, because we had a lot of traveling to do.  After Seventeen, I went to House Beautiful supplement edition.  They published various magazines, half of which were drawn from material—\n\n[Interruption]\n\nSheraton: House Beautiful published two architectural books, two gardening books, and four bridal books a year, half of the material drawn from pages in House Beautiful, using the illustrations, not the story, and half of it original.  I was the managing editor of that division until I started to freelance, and then I freelanced for twenty years, until I got to the Times.\n\nQ:  I must say I find that fascinating, because most people hate freelancing.  I certainly do.  The whole process of selling yourself and pitching stories and all of that.  And you took to it.\n\nSheraton:  Yes, I think I should have been an agent.  I sometimes think I should have been an agent.\n\nQ:  You don’t seem to have had any fear about where the next job would come from.\n\nSheraton:  Well, you do, and that’s why you take too many when you can get them.  I think every freelancer, “I’d better take this because there won’t be another.”  And while you’re doing one, you think, “Gee, what am I going to do when this is finished?”  I mean, I don’t have that quite now, but—\n\nQ:  Why did you go in that direction?\n\nSheraton:  Well, when I left House Beautiful, I had just married Dick and we were traveling, and there was nothing at the moment in the way of a full-time job, and although I was freelance, I did have some contributing contracts, and one of them was with Cue, for whom I was the restaurant critic.\n\nQ:  How did that happen?\n\nSheraton:  Well, my friend who was the editor of Seventeen, who knew how much I loved food and restaurants, had been on Cue and knew the editor, and they needed a restaurant critic, so she said, “Talk to Mimi.”\n\nQ:  Had you ever done anything like that?\n\nSheraton:  No, but I saw it.  I mean, I was reading restaurant reviews in Gourmet, which was about the only place then.  Newspapers didn’t do them in those days.  And I thought it was heaven.\n\nQ:  Tell me what you thought the job would be.\n\nSheraton:  I was passionate about restaurants.  Someone was going to pay me to go to restaurants and pay for the restaurants and eat?  I’m sure that my early reviews in Cue were probably inane.  I was impressed with everything, you know, until you learned all the food and so on.\nSo when I left, I had that as a base.  I left Cue when I had a baby, because it wasn’t practical with a new baby to go out for dinner every night.  I began doing research.  I knew the Restaurant Associates people.  I had met them when I was on Cue.  Joe Baum was looking for a researcher for the Four Seasons, to find menus and recipes and dishes that were seasonal expressions, and to help with menu writing and so on.\nAt the same time, I had an idea for a book.  I was going to write a book, before I got pregnant, that I had a contract with Random House and SAS.  Do you remember Myra Waldo?  I was going to do an around-the-world restaurant cookbook.  I got pregnant, and I felt that I couldn’t keep the book because you have a new baby, you don’t know if you can leave the baby.  And I gave the book to a woman named Charlotte Adams, who was a well-known food writer.\nAfter the baby was born and fine and a year and a half old, SAS said, “We owe you a trip.  Would you like to make a book out of our pamphlets, called City Portraits?” which would be a guide to sixty cities of the world on everything, not only food.  My mother was marvelous.  She said, “Marc can come and live with me.”  The nursemaid/housemaid we had lived around the corner from my mother, by luck.  Dick was fabulous.  And I took off for four months on a trip around the world.  At the same time, I did four articles for Mademoiselle on four different cities, and I bought samples of folk art for Georg Jensen, because Just Lenning, who was the head of Jensen’s, was a good friend of mine from design days.  So I had all of these assignments plus a huge assignment from Restaurant Associates to do a survey of all the food that I came across, in case they ever needed it.  And that’s what paid for it, because although SAS would take me around the world, they didn’t pay for hotels and meals, but Restaurant Associates did.\n\nQ:  What made you think you could do all of that at the same time?  I find that quite amazing.\n\nSheraton:  Well, you have a lot of time in a town.  You look at the sights, you see if there’s folk art.  I could stay as long as I wanted.  The material for the articles I was getting for the book anyway.\n\nQ:  What kind of notes were you taking?  Were you very orderly about certain things for certain articles?\n\nSheraton:  Yes, and of course the wonderful thing was that SAS would send things home every place I went if I bought stuff, samples, they’d put it on a plane and send it home.  They had my winter, fall clothes all packed here, and when I changed climates, I put all the summer clothes in a suitcase.  They took that home and brought me the winter clothes.  I mean, it was a dream.  I still can’t believe it.  I used the time to go to Russia, the Far East, the Middle East, Indonesia, all the way down to Bali, because I had been all over Europe by that time.\n\nQ:  It was very gutsy, wasn’t it, to do that by yourself?\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  They were there for me in certain places, and in certain places they weren’t.  In certain places the head of the office left a package of pamphlets in my room, and that was all I ever heard of them and I was on my own.  But I had contacts.  Dick, who was at that time a merchandise manager at Gimbel’s, knew people who were importers.  In Japan they were very happy to be with me.  I just knew a lot of people by then.\n\nQ:  Did you feel at all uncomfortable about going to markets or restaurants by yourself?  I mean markets at night.\n\nSheraton:  I remember going to a night market in Singapore by myself on a little island, but there were lots of people there.  It wasn’t lonely.  And other places, the SAS people were people I knew.  We all liked each other instantly, fortunately.  I’m still friends with many of them.  That was 1960.  I bought all kinds of crazy cookware for Restaurant Associates and all kinds of folk art for Jensen’s.\nIt was a great four months.  And I learned about the food, by the way.  I would, when I traveled, try to find someone to teach me the cooking of the area in a few places.  I had a very good friend in Denmark who gave cooking classes and was on TV.  We used to cook together in her country house in Denmark when I went there.  Then in Istanbul, I was invited to go to the school of a very famous restaurateur and teacher.  He’s now considered like the Escoffier of Turkey.  His name was Ekrem Yegen, and for five days I went to one of his courses that he did for young Turkish brides, teaching the basic Turkish dishes.  In Beirut, a Lebanese friend arranged for me to spend time in the kitchen of Georges Keyes, the famous Lebanese chef at the Bristol Hotel, a Lebanese and a French kitchen.  In Phnom Penh, the SAS people arranged for me to go to a restaurant there for a few days that did Cambodian and Vietnamese cooking.\n\nQ:  And you kept good records.\n\nSheraton:  Right.\n\nQ:  What was food writing like at that point?\n\nSheraton:  I really didn’t do much food writing then.  I did a few pieces for Town & Country on food, but I did more travel.\n\nQ:  But was there food writing?\n\nSheraton:  Oh, sure.  1960, Craig Claiborne was at the New York Times.  He came in ’58, ’59.  While I was working for TA, I remember they’d talk about this new man came to the Times, Craig, and he began restaurant reviewing, which didn’t exist before, honest restaurant, but they were very small, little reviews in the Wednesday food page, unless the food page was Thursday.  I’m not sure.  There was a time when food pages were Thursday, and then they got changed to Wednesday.\n\nQ:  And Gourmet was still kind of the old Gourmet at that time.\n\nSheraton:  Yes, with these grandiose articles and these lofty and beautiful—I would say the forties to the mid fifties was the best period of Gourmet, and I collect the forties.  I’m missing the first year, which was ’41.\n\nQ:  Where else might it have been—\n\nSheraton:  Well, of course, all the magazines had food stories.  Look had food stories.  Life—there was a wonderful woman who did food for Life.  I forget her name, but she was a real marvelous, showy woman.  And the newspapers had food stories, and Ladies’ Home Journal and Women’s Home Companion, Good Housekeeper and Family Circle, they all had food departments.\n\nQ:  But it wasn’t food writing as it developed, or was it?\n\nSheraton:  I don’t know.  I don’t know if they had sophisticated writers and if they had sophisticated ingredients.  The whole thing began, after World War II, there were many more foreign foods that people here were interested in.\nWhen I went to the Times, what was really bursting and what was huge was gourmet home cooking.  The Times used to publish, every Labor Day, right after Labor Day weekend, a directory of cooking schools in the city.  When I got there, I said, instead of publishing a directory—I mean everybody sent theirs in—why don’t I go to them and critique them for next year.  I went to 125 and I critiqued them.  Some of them were really bad and they didn’t want to let me in the next year to do it.  There were cooking school teachers who were one class ahead of the course they were giving.  You couldn’t get into a cooking class.  That’s when people began to want Garland ranges in their home.  The Cuisinart, which Craig, I think, rightly credited as being sort of a watershed, that suddenly people felt there were things easier to do, but they had to have their own pasta machines, sausage stuffing, ice cream.  Couples would take Saturday, you know, two couples would get together and do a meal and invite friends, but they had to make the sausages, they had to make the pasta.  There was this sort of religion about it.\nSuddenly, in the eighties, everybody was buying takeout and going to restaurants, and who was using the Garland ranges?  They were using not microwaves then, maybe, but what was close to it.\nSo there was gourmet cooking.  Americans had discovered the ingredients, and so the ingredients became available.  It used to be who knew from anything but a champignon in the market?  There were four kinds of lettuce, maybe; there was Bibb and Boston and Romaine and iceberg.  If you lived in an Italian neighborhood, you had escarole, you had rugala.  Except for Balducci, and Balducci came here in ’45, just when I moved into the Village.  They opened up their first store, and they had unusual things.  They had other lettuces.  They had odd kinds of peaches and all of this stuff.  It was just beginning.\nCraig lived on Thirteenth Street.  Jim Beard at that time lived right on Twelfth, near Sixth.  I believe that’s where he still was.  John Clancy was on Sixth Avenue near Eleventh Street.  Paula Peck didn’t live down here, but she spent a lot of time with Jim.  She was sort of a James Beard acolyte.  But there were lots of food people down here, and you would see them in Balducci on Saturday morning.  “What are you buying?  What are you buying?”  So that began to happen.  And Jim always had cooking classes, and that’s when Marcella Hazan had her classes, and Giuliano Bugialli and Lydie Marshall.  And there were some very, very good courses.  Lots of Chinese courses.  Grace Chu was the first to do—she was one of the Wellesley girls.  There was a whole group of Chinese girls who had studied at Wellesley, missionaries.  Many of them opened restaurants.  Sheila Chang, who had the Great Shanghai up on Broadway, Emily Kwoh, who had the Mandarin House on Thirteenth Street, which is the building in which Craig lived, and Grace Chu.\n\nQ:  During this period of time, I notice that you started writing books kind of early in all of this.  How did you bring that into the whole mix?\n\nSheraton:  I had an idea for—of course, the thing that got me to the book and publisher first was City Portraits, the book I did.  So then I knew a publisher, although it was a different publisher that did the next book.  It was called The Seducer’s Cookbook.\n\nQ:  I saw that.  I looked for it at the Society Library, and I was very impressed by the breeziness and the ease, really the quality writing. \n\nSheraton:  Of course, it’s very dated in terms of what was sophisticated, but it was of the period, very much.\n\nQ:  And very felicitously written, as though you—I mean, you had been writing a long time at that point, I guess.\n\nSheraton:  But I take a sort of light view toward sex, so I thought it was kind of funny.  I did, in between all this, some articles for Helen Gurley Brown at Cosmopolitan on boy-girl, men-women relationships, because when she came to Cosmopolitan, the book was pretty old by that time, five, six years old.  She found a copy in her office and decided to serialize it.  She liked it.  So she serialized it in Cosmo and then I began to bring some stories for them, “What Kind of Men Makes the Best Lover,” by profession.\n\nQ:  You mean like doctor, lawyer, Indian chief?\n\nSheraton:  Right.  Writer, salesman.  Then I did one on “How to Get Over a Broken Love Affair.”  I did a diet piece.  And long before that, I did an article—I don’t remember the name of the magazine—called “The Respectable Pickup.”\n\nQ:  I missed that one.  [laughs]\n\nSheraton:  I had Dick go to various places and pick up women that I thought were respectable, a library, a museum, a park.  I also thought a stockholders’ meeting.  [laughter]  It was a very funny article.  And then when I took this trip around the world, I did a piece that appeared in Eros.\n\nQ:  [unclear].  [laughs]\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  When I was going to Japan and I worked for all these crazy guys at Restaurant Associates, they said, “Bring back French ticklers.”  I knew there was a famous sex store, because I had a friend in Tokyo who was a big newspaper, CBS reporter, Pete Kalisher, and I said, “Where do you get French ticklers?”  He said, “There’s a sex drugstore in Yokohama.”  So I was having a car and driver take me from Tokyo to Hakone and we were going to go by Yokohama, and there’s this whole story of how I got this driver to understand where I wanted to go, and how I got into this sex shop, which was full of G.I.’s, and how I picked out the things I wanted, and all the crazy things they had.  I sent the story home in a letter to Dick, and he was having dinner with all these people I worked with at R.A., and he read it and they sent it to Ralph Ginzberg, who was the editor of Eros.\nSo when I came back, Ralph said, “I want to run it as a story.”  By that time I had given all the French ticklers out, so we made them with condoms and we used those very fancy women bathing caps that had rubber flowers on them.  We clipped those off with a very famous art director, Herb Lubalin, who did the photographs for Eros, and he and I sat around making French ticklers so he could illustrate them.  Then Ralph Ginzberg took me out to the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, where they had a Japanese Torii gate, and took a picture of me in front of the Torii gate.  So the only thing about the article that wasn’t authentic was the photograph used to authenticate it.  [laughs]  There’s a lesson in that.  I did a couple of other pieces for him on his other magazines.\n\nQ:  I want to ask you two things before we stop here.  First of all, let’s talk about when you met Dick.\n\nSheraton:  I met Dick through business.  He was a merchandise manager at Gimbel’s, and one of the many departments he had in housewares was unpainted furniture.  I did a lot of stories on unpainted furniture for teenagers, finishing stories, because, you know, that’s what they needed for their room.  Those days, maybe now too, if you ran a story, you ran a retail credit, and you tried to get stores all around the country.  Gimbel’s took the credit in New York, and I went to talk to the buyer about how it might be displayed and show him advance photographs.  We had met at a market display given by a manufacturer whose furniture I wrote about and he bought, so we met at that party.  Then when I did this story, I was still married then; I was not divorced.\nSo I went to see him at Gimbel’s about doing this promotion.  We kind of liked each other.  Then a couple of years later when I got divorced, we met at a housewares market in Atlantic City.  There was always a big July housewares market.  And began going out.\n\nQ:  Where did he live then?\n\nSheraton:  He was from the Bronx, but at that time lived in Queens.  His mother had just moved to Queens, and he had moved her over there and was about to move out and get an apartment in the city, but then he met me and I had an apartment in the city, so we spent time in that apartment, and then we took a house together one summer in Wainscott, and we eloped and got married in Sag Harbor.  I never had a big wedding; I could never stand it.\n\nQ:  When was that?\n\nSheraton:  It was 1955.  We’ve been married fifty-four years this month.\n\nQ:  That’s really wonderful.  The other thing that’s been on my mind is, you were balancing so many different things in different kinds of articles.  What kind of notes did you keep?\n\nSheraton:  Well, first of all, I have a phenomenal memory, fortunately.  In all the years I was a restaurant critic, I never took a note in a restaurant.  And I kept notes.  My only problem with notes is that I can’t always read my handwriting.  I used to bring back things, a brochure, a matchbook, a label, something like that, and I just put it together.\n\nQ:  But you weren’t carrying around like manila folders where you could put these notes for that article and these notes for the next?  That’s just amazing.  Well, along those same lines, it always amazes me when people, truthfully or not, can recount meals that they had many years ago, but you seem to really be able to do that.\n\nSheraton:  Oh, absolutely.  No question.\n\nQ:  How do you do that?\n\nSheraton:  I don’t know.  I guess it’s a good memory, and I guess I focus on it and I tend to see it in a context.  If I say, “What did we eat at that meal?” I sort of see what the person was wearing in the room or what was on that plate.  Every once in a while I have to ask, “Did you have this?” or, “Did you have that?” or, “Was this in that?’  Not often, but sometimes.\n\nQ:  But you never kept diaries or notes or anything like that?\n\nSheraton:  I kept notes on meals when I traveled and was going to come back and write.  Like after I left the New York Times, I had a contract for five or six years with the Condé Nast Traveler, and I traveled all over the country doing stories on food in different cities and doing an annual story on fifty restaurants worth a special visit.  There I took notes because I wasn’t going to come back and write it for a long time.  But I brought menus.  I would either steal or ask, just as a tourist.  I never said who I was.  A lot of tourists ask for menus.  I would check those at night in the hotel room so I’d remember what dishes I had.  If I had a comment, I’d sometimes put it on the menu, because seeing something like that menu was better for me than seeing my own notes.  Suddenly the whole room is there.  You know, I didn’t do all the articles at once.  I tended to have one article.  I wasn’t writing for Helen Gurley Brown while I was writing my book or something, I don’t think.\n\nQ:  You were more or less serially doing things?\n\nSheraton:  Yes, I guess this week that, next week that.  And what I used to do in our previous apartment before we moved here and after our son was born, I would go to a hotel in the Village with a portable Olivetti typewriter, which is what you used in those days, and do my assignments in hotel rooms, because the little room I had for an office in the other apartment, baby, nanny, and they were very inexpensive hotels here, the Earl, which is now the Washington Square Hotel, the Van Renssaleer.  Rooms were three-fifty, four dollars a day, and you could go in at nine in the morning, checkout time was three o’clock the next day, and they would store my typewriter, so the following day I could check in again and the typewriter would be there, so I would get two days’ work for one night’s charge.\n\nQ:  And they obviously knew what you were doing, with our typewriter there.\n\nSheraton:  Oh yes.  Many writers did that, many writers.  I went home to sleep; I didn’t sleep there.  But it was a way to get away and be quiet.  Then when we moved here, I had the whole third floor for offices.  My son was seven when we moved here, but still, he wasn’t a baby running around screaming.  He was in school.\n\nQ:  Do you have as good a taste memory as you do for the actual meals?\n\nSheraton:  Yes, absolutely.\n\nQ:  Do you articulate that at all to yourself after a meal?\n\nSheraton:  I think I recall it when I have to.  It just comes.  I don’t know if what I tasted forty years ago and thought was terrific I would think was terrific now.  I may remember it as terrific, but I’m not sure.  I’d probably remember if it had cinnamon in it or cloves or something distinctive about it.\n\nQ:  But the few minutes I’ve had meals with you, though, I’ve always been impressed that it was a “no bullshit” articulation and discussion.  It was very sort of specific to what you were eating at that time, and even the things that you recalled at the same time.  I don’t know how to explain this correctly, but I was just very interested that you could remember as much as you could from other times, other places.\n\nSheraton:  Well, don’t you think that people who specialize, don’t you think that fashion writers who go to fashion shows can remember clothes they saw a long time ago?  I bet you Bernadine Morris remembers Yves St. Laurent’s Russian period and the fabrics she saw and whether they had darts or shoulder pads.  It’s your specialty and you’re obsessed with it, and you just remember.  Of course, that’s what you think about, I guess.\n\nQ:  When you go to remember at all now or in the years that you’ve been freelancing since you left the Times and the other magazines where you worked, do you take more notes?\n\nSheraton:  No.  No.\n\nQ:  So if you had to think about what was it that was on the menus in, I don’t know, 1984, how would you go about doing that if you were just trying to think about—\n\nSheraton:  What was on the menus?\n\nQ:  I mean what kinds of food were popular at what periods of time.\n\nSheraton:  Of course, I have all my guidebooks.  I wrote a New York Times Restaurant Guidebook, so I have 1981 or something.  I have my articles.  I have every article I ever wrote.\n\nQ:  You do?  Not just from the newspapers, but from everywhere?\n\nSheraton:  From everywhere.  Of course, after Cue, I did restaurants for the Village Voice before I went to New York Magazine.  I have maybe not every one, but almost all of them.\n\nQ:  You kept scrapbooks?\n\nSheraton:  I kept the clippings in a folder.  And then at the Times I had a wonderful secretary who filed everything.  When I left, she packed up all the files and sent them to me.  So I have that, and I have them by months and I have them by subject, so I can always look in there.  Now, of course, I tend to just go online and go to the Times archives and not dig through the dusty files unless it was before they put it in the archives.\nThen I do have what interests me very much, a few old restaurant guidebook to New York.  I have one for 1923 that’s just marvelous because it shows such social attitudes.  There was nothing P.C.  They talk about “little Japanese,” “little brown people who did this.”  You should see the way they talked about Greenwich Village.  It was so funny.  They quoted someone who had written an article saying it had been originally inhabited by Indians who didn’t have very much furniture, but what they had was painted blue.  The men had long hair, the women had short hair.  The men wore jewelry.  Everyone thought they were peculiar, and the more peculiar they were thought to be, the more peculiar they became.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Somebody made that up.\n\nSheraton:  It was some writer even before this guidebook who had written this parody on Greenwich Village as being these Indians who were bohemians.  I love the more peculiar they were thought to be, the more peculiar they became.  [laughter]  Of course, I just loved the Village.  When I moved into the Village in ’45, I was in heaven.  Everybody was crazy and I loved it.  I still love it.\n\nQ:  Do you have memories of what the restaurants were like?\n\nSheraton:  Very much.  Of course I had to save money like mad to go to any of them, and for a long time the only thing I would have when I went to them was chopped steak, because it was the cheapest thing on the menu.  And it suddenly occurred to me, what’s the point of going to all these restaurants and then coming out and saying, “I don’t think it’s so terrific.”\n\tThe Brevoort was a very famous restaurant, and the Lafayette, and Charles French Restaurant, which was where the Jefferson Market is now.  Oh, there were a lot of restaurants down here.  Mother Bertolotti’s.  Even Asti’s in those days, on Twelfth near Sixth, was a very good restaurant.  It wasn’t just funny with the opera singing.  Luchow’s, of course.  With Dick, we went to Luchow’s at Christmas and other times.  So there were a lot of very good restaurants here.\n\nQ:  What about the little places that you might have seen?\n\nSheraton:  Rocco’s was a wonderful one, still exists.  It’s not good.  I shouldn’t say that.  I haven’t been in in ten years, but subsequently, new management.  That used to be a great favorite of José Quintero.  You could see him eating there.  The very great photographer, Eliot Elisofon, always ate there.  It was Romeo Salta’s favorite Italian restaurant.  There was an Abruzzo wife and husband and brother who ran it.  And since Dick’s mother was from Abruzzo and they made all the food she made, I knew it before I married him, but then when we married, we went to Rocco’s a lot.  It’s still there.  It’s across the street from Lupa, but as I say, it’s not the same.\n\nQ:  Was Dick’s mother a good cook?\n\nSheraton:  Fabulous cook.  I don’t know if you saw the piece I wrote to The New Yorker in their November food issue, but I wrote a whole piece on brodetto that began with her.  She was a fantastic cook, very light, very delicate.  Abruzzo people are supposed to be very good cooks, and she certainly was that.  \n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSheraton 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Mimi Sheraton\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #2\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t           New York City\n\nDate:  July 20, 2009\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It’s July 20, 2009.  I am with Mimi Sheraton in her house in Greenwich Village, and we are about to do our second interview.\nGood afternoon.\n\nSheraton:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  We agreed that one of the things we’d focus on today, since you have been a restaurant and food critic for such a long time and at different venues, we’d talk about how you perceive food and restaurant food to have changed over the years, but let’s just first, for the record, point out where and generally when you have been a food and restaurant critic and, for that matter, a food writer, because to me that counts in terms of your observation.\n\nSheraton:  The first time I was officially that was at Cue magazine, where for the first few years they had me write under the name of Martha Martin because they didn’t think Mimi Sheraton was believable.  Eventually changed to Mimi Sheraton, and that was roughly from 1955 through the middle of 1958.\n\nQ:  Hard to imagine Martha Martin as being believable, but maybe in the mid fifties it was possible.  [laughs]\n\nSheraton:  It sounded like Betty Crocker or something, I guess.  Then I guess there were a couple of years’ lapse and I did two years, maybe three, at the Village Voice.  I’m not sure of those dates.  From ’70 to ’75, I wrote for New York Magazine, and I did primarily food pieces, products, markets, reported on caterers, but I did five or six restaurant critique pieces, rather big ones for them.  Then in December of 1975, I went to the New York Times.  In August of ’76 I became officially the restaurant critic and was that until December 31, 1983. \n\nQ:  Could you just talk a little bit about how you got to the Times?\n\nSheraton:  The Times called me after articles they had read at New York Magazine and asked me to come over for an interview.  Joan Whitman, who was then the “Style” editor, called me at New York Magazine\n\nQ:  And presumably you were happy to have that kind of—\n\nSheraton:  I was conflicted.  I loved working for New York Magazine.  I loved the brazenness.  I loved the brashness.  I liked the spirit of New York Magazine very, very much.  And I had heard so many things about the New York Times editing copy and wanting it a certain way, that I was a little bit overwhelmed, and I thought, “Do I really want to do this?”  But they were paying much, much more, which is hard to believe the New York Times paying much, much more than anybody, but they did, over New York Magazine.  And I went, and the rest is history.\n\nQ:  So at the time that you went there, how would you generally characterize the kinds of food that was being served in restaurants at that point?  You can start before that if you want.  You can start with what you observed over time.\n\nSheraton:  I don’t think there were too many changes in the beginning when I was at Cue and Village Voice.  They were more or less traditional restaurants—French, Italian, American, Chinese.  Sometimes it was a nightclub restaurant or an all-American continental restaurant, but they were not innovative dishes.  They were much more classics and people knew what to expect.\nI always remember my first three reviews for Cue magazine, because each restaurant I went to had the same appetizer specialty and they were all under different names.  One was a crêpe maison, one was a crêpe de fruits de mer, and I forgot what the third was, but they all had three different names for seafood crêpe.  So you could see that that was what people expected in those restaurants, Charles French Restaurant, which no long exists, on Sixth Avenue, a lot of places like that.  And it was much more predictable what you were going to have.\nWe were just beginning to see some new products in food markets, because I also always wrote about products and food and cooking, and of course we had Balducci’s in Greenwich Village, and they brought in a lot of fruits and vegetables that people had not seen in other markets, which are now quite commonplace.  That was just the beginning of that.\nBy the time I got to New York Magazine, nouvelle cuisine came into being.  There were many more products available.  Americans were traveling, products were able to be shipped much more quickly by air, and I would say the press and television disseminated knowledge and interest in food that spread across the country.  There was Dione Lucas, there was The Galloping Gourmet.  It was beginning to be an event.  Then I don’t know the year of Julia Child, but that I would say began a certain kind of peak.\nThe other big change was, I would say, in food writing, in what was becoming acceptable, and I think the biggest difference there was made by Craig Claiborne when he went to the Times and suddenly took it away from home economists and made it a food professional’s viewpoint in writing about food, and also negative restaurant criticism, which, as far as I know, did not exist before then.  He did very short little box reviews, but if a place was not good, he said so, and that was very unheard of.\nGourmet magazine was reviewing restaurants in those days, but it was always, always a puff piece.  In fact, in those early days, if you called the critic for Gourmet, you were given the advertising department.  The critic was attached to the advertising department.  His name escapes me at the moment.  Alvin Kerr.  \nSo it was a different kind of approach that the Times permitted Craig to do what he did.  That immediately, I think, gave all of us a view of what we could do and made other publications interested in that.  New York Magazine, I think, always felt they could do negative reviews.  Clay Felker knew that was the way to get attention.\n\nQ:  These would be of fairly well-known places as opposed to little hole-in-the-walls?\n\nSheraton:  Unless they found little hole-in-the-walls, because by that time New York Magazine, under Milton Glaser and Jerome Snyder, had instituted “The Underground Gourmet,” and that was little far-out places where you could eat.  I don’t know if it was under $2.50 or $5.00 in those days.  So those were ethnic and out-of-the-way and small.  Gael Greene did the restaurants, the more formal.\n\nQ:  Was “The Underground Gourmet” the first, as you know it, to give prominence to [unclear]?\n\nSheraton:  The first I know, it began not at New York Magazine, but began at the magazine section of the Herald Tribune, which was where all the people who started New York Magazine came from, and Jerome Snyder and Milton Glaser, who were good friends and both graphic designers and artists, were big New York eaters, and they really liked those ethnic places, so they had a great time doing that.  So it began to be something with great interest to people.\n\tThen, of course, new restaurants began opening, and I was a consultant from ’58, for about four years, to Restaurant Associates, and helped create the menu at the original Four Seasons, and that was an enormous departure.  That was not traditional food; that was innovations on traditional recipes.  That was fusion.  You might get Cape Cod fried shrimp with a Japanese wasabi dressing.  They just looked all over and took what they wanted.  There was also an enormous emphasis there on freshness and local.  They had a basket of vegetables that they brought around and showed everybody; you could pick what you wanted.  So that began to start a trend to theme restaurants, which they had already begun at the Forum of the Twelve Caesars, the Hawaiian Room, and there was a lot of interest in going out to that kind of eating.  It made reviewing probably a little more difficult because you had to understand more to do it.  There were dishes that no one ever saw before, and reviews were powerful.\n\nQ:  You’ve always managed to travel a lot in your jobs, but you had by this time traveled a good bit, hadn’t you?\n\nSheraton:  Yes.\n\nQ:  You were fairly knowledgeable about this.\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  First of all, I have since 1953 been going back and forth to Europe, Mexico, and so on.  Then in 1960 I took a four-month trip around the world for a book called City Portraits, and spent most of the time in the Soviet Union, the Far East, and the Middle East, areas I had not known and been to, and did a big survey for Restaurant Associates on food they might draw upon for other restaurant themes.  I wrote some articles for Mademoiselle.  I bought folk art—I think we went over this—for Jensen’s, and took some cooking courses.  I spent time in Beirut, in Phnom Penh, in Tokyo, various places, a few days each with chefs, learning the basics of the cuisine.  So by the time I came back to New York Magazine, I had already been, by the way, to the Cordon Bleu by that time for an eight-week course.  I didn’t take the whole year.\nI knew a lot and I had done a lot.  When I started writing for Cue, I must say I didn’t really know anything more than what I liked, but by that time I had been reading Gourmet since I was sixteen and thinking how great it would be to be a food critic.\n\nQ:  Really?\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  I thought, “This is a wonderful life.”  I loved eating in restaurants since childhood.  My parents took me to a lot.  To me that was the best way to eat.  I’m still absolutely crazy about restaurants at any level.  I thought, “My god, to go around and somebody pays for it or nobody pays for it.”  [laughs]  I didn’t know how they did it.  But every place I worked for, they paid for it.  There were no free meals allowed at any place, though that’s not true at many publications.\n\nQ:  Maybe you want to mention something about that, about that tradition of no free meals, because I think a lot of people have the misapprehension that restaurants comp people all the time.\n\nSheraton:  Well, many do in cities outside of New York.  Small publications that cannot afford to do it any other way will let a critic do one visit and be comped.  Those critics always say, “But I’m still independent, and if I don’t like it, I can say so.”  I have never yet seen a negative review from anyone who said that.  My view of that is if you can’t afford to do it right, don’t do it at all.  So no one that I’ve ever worked for has been as generous as the Times, with the number of times you can go to a place.  As far as I knew, when I was there, there was no limit.  Nobody ever said, “Are you crazy?”  Three was a minimum, and I went as many as eight, even maybe ten once when a strike—\n\nQ:  That’s amazing.\n\nSheraton:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So by the time you got to the Times, the very beginning of the time you got to the Times, what was the food in restaurants like at that point?  Had it changed a little from your first experience?\n\nSheraton:  It was beginning to.  We had the Forum of the Twelve Caesars.  By that time the Four Seasons was eighteen, twenty years old, opened in ’59, and I went in ’73.  But you began to get more stylish Italian restaurants, not the southern.  The same in Indian; north Indian.  It was always the north was the cuisine we didn’t know, and that was the elegant one, the tandoori cooking and so on.  And beginning of very beautiful restaurants where that was more or less the theme.  I remember there was one downtown that was absolutely beautiful.  It was all pink and elegant and glowing, and their cuisine was a little bit stylized and pretty too.\n\nQ:  That was Italian?\n\nSheraton:  No, it was continental.  It didn’t have an ethnic theme, that particular one.  The public was still very interested in very ethnic restaurants.  I reviewed a lot of the Mittel-European restaurants around Second and Third Avenue.  In the seventies and eighties those were very, very big.  Northern Chinese food, rather than Cantonese, was beginning to be—Shun Lee Palace and so on.  There were many in D.C. by that time.  I remember at one point they had cooks come over and man a restaurant in Washington.  There were always steakhouses.  By that time I think La Fonda del Sol may have already been gone; I’m not sure.  But that was another Restaurant Associates theme that was well before its time.\n\tI did, in the beginning, two restaurants a week in the Friday review, and it was Friday in the “Weekend” section, not Wednesday in the “Dining” section.  I think that makes a big difference.  I had to do two a week in the same review, so I would try—\n\nQ:  An enormous amount of work.\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  So I would try for a balance.  If one were coming out bad, I would want something in reserve that I could use good.  If one was uptown, I would try downtown.  If one were expensive, I would try—if one were Mexican, I would try—I would try so that the reader, after all, looks at it to find a place to go over a weekend, not to find out where not to go.  So I tried very hard to do that and also to keep a balance in price.  Abe Rosenthal said that I was very, very good about using restaurants that were not always very expensive.  He liked that.\n\nQ:  That was important to him?\n\nSheraton:  And to me.  And he would go.  He went.  He used to look.  By Friday he would say, or Thursday, “What’s coming out?  I want to go before it comes out.”  He valued the fact that he could take his whole family to Praha on a Sunday night for Czechoslovakian goose or duck, and ten dollars a person, and it was really, really good if you’re not snooty about where you are.  So I think we still have ethnic places now.  They’re different, though.  They’re not so Mom and Pop.  They tend to be young boy wonder, you know, Momofuko, something like that.\n\tMy feeling always, I think different reviewers have different points of view, which is great because then the public can find the viewpoint they like.  I felt my first responsibility was to the reader and to the reader who was not a regular restaurant-goer, who had a lot of money and ate out every lunch and dinner.  I really had in mind the couple who come in for an anniversary or a birthday and what’s going to happen to them on a Saturday night at Le Cirque.  But overall, in doing that, there was also plenty for the upscale aficionados to get out of it.  I would think even at another level, something for professionals to get out, an idea that a restaurateur might find intriguing, even if the place were not good, the presentation or gimmick that was applicable.\nSo I don’t know that I deliberately tried for all those three levels, but they were usually in it, with the bridge and tunnel person as my primary—I tried very hard to explain ingredients that they wouldn’t understand.  I read a lot of reviews now—perhaps people are supposed to know much more and do know more—where it will say it had a ponzu sauce.  I wonder how many people I know who go out and know what that is.  If you would say a soy and lime ponzu sauce, at least they have a clue as to whether it’s tomatoes or cream or, you know.  So I tried to do that wherever I could.\nI felt my duty to the restaurants was only to be fair, to go enough times so that I could sample enough things to see it wasn’t just a bad night or maybe they were very good at grilling and they were terrible at frying.  There were many restaurants who were good at anything except fish; they just didn’t handle it right.  So you would say, “If you go here, it would be better if you didn’t order the fish.”\nI think what I wrote—and maybe what every reviewer writes—is what I wanted to read, that if I were faced with the possibility of going to a restaurant about which I knew nothing, what would I want to know.  I want to know what it looks like, because I’m a woman and I want to know what to wear.  So, something about mood or style, which you can do in a sentence or two.  Elegant, flossy, laid back.  There are ways of doing it.  Maybe a little bit about the crowd that goes there.  I certainly want to know about the service.  Are they going to be nice?  Are they snooty?  Is it laid back?  And then I want to know about the food, so in detail, what to eat and what not to eat.  That’s why I spend so much time going and wrote long reviews that were all about food.\nI would repeat dishes to see if they’re consistent.  I usually did not ask for anything done in a special way until the last visit, to see if they would be accommodating.  Could I have the peas instead of the spinach with the lamb?  It was beginning to be the time when the chefs were saying no to that.  The creative restaurants that were beginning toward the end of my stint at the Times, like the Quilted Giraffe, for example, they were doing Dodin Bouffant.  They were beginning to do very innovative things that didn’t always work and sometimes did.\nBut I felt I had to have enough of the idea of the food to steer people very, very plainly, and I developed in the box in the New York Times recommended dishes.\n\nQ:  That hadn’t been done before?\n\nSheraton:  That had not been done before.  I don’t know if service had been done separately.  I think so.  But recommended dishes was very, very popular because people would tear out that little box and not carry the whole review, and they would go to the restaurant with the box in hand.\n\nQ:  That’s really amazing.\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  And they would order from it.\n\nQ:  I should say that we’re not going to go into all your years at the Times in enormous detail because you’ve covered them so well in your memoir, Eating My Words.  That said, there was one thing in Eating My Words about a hot dog contest or something way before you started reviewing, about judging—maybe I’m misremembering the book, but judging the taste of a hot dog according to several qualities, whether it was the flavor, the firmness.\n\nSheraton:  I think what I wrote about hot dogs in the book, if I remember correctly, was when I was a kid in Coney Island.\n\nQ:  That’s right.\n\nSheraton:  One night a whole bunch of us decided to see if Nathan’s or Feltman’s had the better hot dog.\n\nQ:  But you established criteria that seemed—\n\nSheraton:  Well, it seems to me now, without looking at the book, that I—\n\nQ:  Seemed like good criteria.\n\nSheraton:  I like natural casings that are crisp, so they spurt.  The spurt is very important, that they be juicy, smoky, peppery.\n\nQ:  But even as a kid then, you had a sense of the importance of different aspects of taste.\n\nSheraton:  Absolutely.  Well, because my parents talked a lot about it.  This one is better than that one and so on.  Of course, the hot dog thing was kind of a joke, because we must have each eaten eight hot dogs that night.  “No, I don’t remember.  Let’s go back.  Oh, I just forgot that.”  [laughs]  So it got to be a teenagers’ craziness.  But it had a germ of something in it, because one of the stories I did for the Times on judging pastrami in New York, pastrami and corn beef, there was a day when I was in a cab with 102 pastrami and corn beef sandwiches collected around the city.  So that was maybe Feltman’s, Nathan’s [unclear].\n\nQ:  I remember a piece you did about hamburgers, that when you went to a lot of, I guess, different Greek delicatessens and various other places and you finished the day—you couldn’t eat them all.\n\nSheraton:  Right.  I put them in my handbag.\n\nQ:  You put them in your handbag and then you went to Saks.\n\nSheraton:  Saks Fifth Avenue, and pulled out my wallet to pay, and all these hamburgers wrapped in napkins.\n\nQ:  It was just so funny because as you reported, the salesperson said, “What are these?”  And you said, “These are my hamburgers.”  [laughter]  Which showed, God knows, you were responsible to taste everything.\n\nSheraton:  Now, of course, you can’t pick up anything without reading hamburgers.  It’s the current rage.  If I read one more word about pizza or hamburgers, I may never eat any one of them again.\n\nQ:  During the years that you were at the Times, what other changes did you notice on either menus or in markets?\n\nSheraton:  Not only markets, but one big change—and I don’t know if we talked about this before; you can stop me if we did—when I first came to the Times, one of the big rages was home cooking and cooking schools.  The Times every day in September, right after Labor Day, published a list of all the cooking schools in New York.  It was just information they sent in.  I said, “Why don’t I critique them next year?”  So I went to about 125, and there were some cooking schools where the teacher was only one lesson ahead of the class.  She was taking another course and teaching.  It was such a rage, you couldn’t get in.  Marcella Hazan, Giuliano Bugialli, Lydie Marshall.  I mean, they were all over.\nAnd every one had to have a Cuisinart, which is what Craig credited with the boom in home cooking.  Pasta machines, ice cream makers, sausage stuffers, people had all of those.  It’s when people began being interested in having Garland ranges in their home.  And a Saturday for a young with-it couple would be to prepare a great dinner, doing everything from scratch, and then having friends over.  They made the pasta; they made the ice cream.\nGradually I saw that fade out as the restaurant rage came in.  I began to think of those other kitchens that people put in as having tumbleweed rolling through them.  [laughter]  Nobody was cooking anymore.  Now I think we’re in a big era of takeout food, maybe combined with some home cooking.  I mean, so many restaurants do takeout now as a way to get some of the business they would otherwise lose.\nBut it’s the products that were available to us that made the very big difference.  Mushrooms, for example.  For many years there were only champignon.  You could get other kinds dry, but fresh.  And lettuces, I mean there would be Romaine and iceberg and Boston.  If you were in an Italian neighborhood you could probably get rugula, but that was not known outside of Italian markets.  And all varieties of foods that the public began to know about and want because they traveled and had them.  Because cooks on television were showing them and the magazines and newspapers were writing about them, they were not afraid to try them.\n\nQ:  And you think that the food markets responded to that.\n\nSheraton:  The specialty food market.  The supermarkets didn’t respond for a long time.  Now, of course, they all have a lot of kind of mushrooms, so they’re usually in terrible condition in the supermarket.  They don’t have lettuces in as good condition as the specialty markets still.  And of course, now the emphasis on the green markets and local and organic is sort of a whole other next step.\n\nQ:  I wonder if you remember when—and I think it’s only in supermarkets, but maybe not—they started weighing down the produce with water.  It made it look shiny and clean, but of course it also made it heavier and not good for the produce as you were taking it home.\n\nSheraton:  Right.\n\nQ:  Do you have any sense of when that—\n\nSheraton:  I think it happened a long time ago, because I used to write about that.  I did a consumer buying column called “The Educated Shopper” for the Times, where I would usually deal with one food, usually fruit and vegetables, and how to buy it.  Especially with salad greens or the green things, I would say, “Shake it out before you take it to the scale.”  And they claimed it was a way of keeping things fresh, but of course it wasn’t.  It sometimes ruined them.  But I think those kind of cheatings always went on, whether it was a thumb on a scale, or if you’re buying smoked salmon, do they weigh it with the paper?  Do they subtract the weight of the paper when they put it on the scale?  And many do.  I assure you Zabar’s will tell you that they begin at 08 or something and they do at Citarella, accounting for the weight of the paper on the sliced meats and fish.  So there are all kinds of little obfuscations, and I don’t think that’s new.\n\nQ:  When did the markets like Dean & Deluca and the proliferation of cheese stores and bread stores—\n\nSheraton:  It was while I was at the Times.  I would say late seventies, early eighties.  Dean & Deluca was really the first, along with E.A.T.  We had cheese stores before that, but they were places like William Poll, and of course Bloomingdale’s had a super food department when I was at New York Magazine.  The first story I did that got attention at New York Magazine was I tasted everything in Bloomingdale’s food department.  I tasted 1,196 items and reported.  Cheese was a very big thing.  The buyer, Bob Gumpert, had grown up sort of elegantly in New York and he understood all these foods, and that was the premium food department in those days, on the main floor if you came in on the Fifty-Ninth Street side.\n\nQ:  Why do you think they gave that up?\n\nSheraton:  I think there was too much competition of places that could concentrate more and do it better, and they were outpriced.  Now so many people have that cheese.  Also, this is an important change, and I did write about it in my book.  In those days, I would say before the sixties anyway, a fancy food department consisted mainly of packaged foods, imported canned soups from England and France, even imported game, cooked.  It was so disgusting, you can’t imagine.  Canned peas, canned hearts of palm, that was fancy food.  They didn’t have fresh food departments.  The only fresh things they had was cheese and sometimes delicatessen meats.  There was no such thing as a vegetable department in Macy’s food department nor in Bloomingdale’s food department.  They had cakes, they can candy, but they had no real perishables.  And you just looked at lines of cans.  What I did, I tasted everything and Bloomingdale’s sent me the food.  It was a dare from the part of the buyer.  They sent me so many cans of jam, I had to take one bathtub in this house and put all the jars of jam in that tub.  Every bookshelf was lined with cans.  There were ninety-two boxes of tea to be brewed.  I brewed every one.\n\nQ:  Oh, my lord.\n\nSheraton:  Took eleven months.  But you barely see a canned item now in the fancy food.  Maybe jams and some spices or something, but not the soups and the vegetables.  Even prestigious restaurants felt it was okay to serve canned vegetables if they were French—petit pois.  You could not get petit pois in a restaurant in New York in those days that was not out of a can.  When I reviewed 21 [Club] and I said that they had some dish like squab with petit pois, I said they were canned peas.  I used to call and check some of my facts with the restaurant.  I remember Sheldon Tannen saying, “Not canned peas.  They’re petit pois.”  So I wrote they were little canned French peas.  But that was considered luxury.\n\nQ:  I guess white asparagus, that kind of thing too.\n\nSheraton:  Right.\n\nQ:  And that would have been the sixties, seventies?\n\nSheraton:  Fifties, sixties, and then began to fade away.  But there were even people in homes who considered it fancier to serve canned or frozen to guests than fresh, because it was a new product, it was clean, it was bright, you know.  That perception, I think, has changed.  And of course TV dinners.  I don’t remember where they were in the dateline.  I don’t think they were so big by the time I got to the Times.\n\nQ:  When do you recall people starting to go to the Greenmarket or other places like that?  There were always stalls in the country.\n\nSheraton:  In the country, but in the city, I would say whenever the Union Square Greenmarket opened, whatever year that was.  Down here certainly you had a slightly different kind of people who I think would respond to that very quickly, and then they began to grow up all over.  I don’t know the year, but I would say that’s when the awareness began to grow.\n\nQ:  What about shopping down either here in the Italian stores or in Chinatown?\n\nSheraton:  A lot of us did that even in the fifties and sixties.  Of course, this neighborhood had a real Italian market on Bleeker Street, which faded away at the end of the fifties.  The pushcarts went off the street.  In the sixties we began to see the little salumerias close.  We used to have a wonderful man on Bleeker Street, Mr. Mandaro, who made his own mozzarella.  He was old and his son didn’t want to do that.  It was next to John’s Pizzeria on Bleeker.  And there used to be very good fish markets on that street, but they were all run by older people whose children wanted bigger things, even if they stayed in food.  I remember that Mr. Mandaro’s son, who didn’t want to make mozzarella all his life, went to work for one of the big catering firms like—I think it was Canteen Corporation of America or something.  So it was food-connected, but it was a job where you wore a suit and you went home and you had weekends in the country, a different thing entirely.\n\nQ:  What about bread?\n\nSheraton:  Bread too, but, of course, now bread is chic, so we have many good bread bakeries, even though they’re not the old ones.  Like Zito no longer exists on Bleeker Street, but we have plenty of good bread baked at Tomcat and Sullivan and places like that.\n\nQ:  The reason I ask is I was in Washington, but we were out of the country and then I guess came back in ’77, and it took a couple of years before bread—I mean, when I got there, there was no decent bread, and then bread took off.  It took off because people responded to it so well.  Is that the timeframe that you were—\n\nSheraton:  Yes, I think it probably happened here a little sooner than in Washington, and I don’t remember dates.\n\nQ:  It had Orwasher’s.\n\nSheraton:  Well, Orwasher’s is an old-timer that makes old-time Eastern European breads and very well, but that again got to be in a neighborhood that you had to go to to get it, because unless Orwasher’s is sold wholesale, there was no one baking that kind of bread down here.\n\nQ:  Do you remember what baguettes were like during this period of time?  Could you get them?\n\nSheraton:  Well, they were pretty good down here because there used to be a French bakery on Sixth Avenue near Eleventh Street that baked bread and you could get that, and they had sort of baguettes at Zito, which was always down here.  There still is an argument about what is a good one, because not all that are made now are good.  I can’t remember the date when bread became chic.\n\nQ:  Did you make bread yourself at any point?\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  Sure, to try it and see what it was like.  And also someone would come out with a special pan for making bread with a crust, I would try that.  But I never made bread as the weekly source of bread.\n\nQ:  I tried it for a while.  I guess it would have been in the late seventies.  Then once bread became available, it just didn’t make sense.\n\nSheraton:  It was always fattening and I was always trying not to eat too much bread.  Of course, once I started critiquing restaurants, I almost never ate at home.  I only ate at home five times in the year 1983, which is my last full year at the Times.  Only five dinners at home all year.  So I didn’t do a lot of heavy cooking.  I had just had a whole new great kitchen put in for the first time in my life, and then became the restaurant critic of the New York Times and ate out every night.  [laughs]\n\tNow, of course, I think what’s happened, and I think it’s a direct result of nouvelle cuisine and what it started, which was chefs as celebrities, chefs as stars.  I think what it’s come down to now, to a large extent, is chefs cooking for the critics and cooking to outdo each other.  I think the press, in a way, has a lot to answer for.  On the other hand, if you’re a critic, you critique what you’re dealt with.  You critique with what’s going on.  I mean, if there are terrible plays on Broadway, the theater critic is just giving terrible reviews.  But I think with something like food, I think the language that the writers use has sort of settled in the minds of the chefs, and I sometimes think they’re planning dishes that would make good copy.  “We’d better add a something so it will sound good,” or, “Let’s add fennel pollen,” or, “Let’s add something.”\nI do think we’re at a postmodern phase in food, which I have once read—I think it was Richard Meier describe postmodern architecture as the illiterate application of symbols, and I think we’re seeing the illiterate application of symbols in food all over the place.  The message of the restaurant to the diner, “I know what’s going on.  You’re safe here.  See the fusion.  See the Latino tortilla mixed with the Southeast Asian something,” and sending out this message that they’re with it.  And mostly it’s badly done.  The real innovators who start trends like that, like Jean George Vongerichten, for example, they are really students of it and they do it well and they go back to the original cuisine to do it, whereas the others just copy the people who have done it.\n\nQ:  You mentioned you think some of this started with nouvelle cuisine.  Is that because the chefs who were cooking it had to, in some way or other, articulate or defend it?\n\nSheraton:  No, I think it’s because they’re new unheard-of creations captured the imagination of the press.  Gault Millau, for example, had a lot to answer for.  I think there were some good results of nouvelle cuisine and some bad ones.  I think Gault Millau fostered it almost unnaturally by giving a higher mark to nouvelle cuisine.  I think they had two colors, and if you got, say, three stars black, that was good, but if you were nouvelle cuisine, you got three stars in red or whatever the rating.  They didn’t give stars; they gave a numerical rating.  But they had a red and a black, and the red, it’s very, very good but it’s not nouvelle.  They so much lauded the nouvelle cuisine chefs that it was almost had to be, if you really wanted the top, top rating.\n\tMichelin, on the other hand, hung back for a long time, too long, in changing their views of the ratings, I think.  I think they still do.  I think Michelin is still mired a little bit in a certain kind of formality in a restaurant that’s no longer valid from most of the eating public’s point of view.\n\tAndré Soltner had said about Paul Bocuse that “His greatest contribution is making chefs not servants, but stars,” which meant that the profession could attract different kinds of people, better people, in a sense, more focused, more educated, and to that extent, I think it was very good.  I think the other good aspect, if not overdone, was throwing away the rules, that you could combine—\n\nQ:  The French rules?\n\nSheraton:  The French rules.  You could combine a Japanese item in a French dish.  You could shortcut the process.  That I think was good, as long as it was good.  If someone was terrible at it, then it was terrible.  There are many chefs who are very good at doing traditional dishes, who are not good at innovating, but feel they have to.  They feel like a fashion designer who has to come out with a line three or four times a year.  They have to come out with new menu items or they’re not going to get the attention of the press.\n\nQ:  Was that part of the fusion?\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  I think fusion is a part of that, and fusion, of course, has to do with travel and it has to do with an aggression in this country.  I mean, you know, just as when our parents, maybe a Jewish person from Austria lived next to a Jewish person from Turkey and they learned to do some dishes.  Now you go to the markets and Latinos and Asians have so many similar food products because of climate, that they can shop in each other’s markets and they begin to work them into the cuisines in different ways, which I think is very good.  I mean, seeds blown around the world.\n\nQ:  What’s available now, it’s really extraordinary in terms of whether they’re Asian products, including Korean or very odd things, or Latin American things.\n\nSheraton:  Or Indian.  Look at the Southeast Asian, all those exotic ingredients.  You can get everything here.  Now, that, of course, raises another issue that the locavores are screaming about, and the carbon footprint and should we be able to get this stuff.  Is it right to have everything shipped even from California to New York?\n\nQ:  I’d like to know what you think, but I guess my own thought is we have been eating bananas a very long time.  [laughs]\n\nSheraton:  And where will I get a lemon?\n\nQ:  Yes, exactly.  And oranges.\n\nSheraton:  Right.  I mean, even something that I might get locally, not so good.  Let’s take peaches.  We get pretty good peaches from Pennsylvania and Jersey, but nothing like Georgia peaches.  And I’m going to buy a Georgia peach whenever I can, as compared to a Pennsylvania peach, so that means I’m buying peaches that have left a bigger carbon footprint, and I figure, work it out, find some way to ship it that doesn’t leave a carbon footprint.  I think it’s good to have stuff coming from afar.  I think it’s good for human relations.  I think it’s good for being interdependent.  I think it’s what makes the world go ‘round.  People have been eating food from far-off places forever.  I mean, Columbia discovered America because he was looking for Indian spices.  The Romans brought ice down from the Alps so they could store oysters in summer.  So if you see something, you want it.  That, I think, makes progress.\n\nQ:  There is some thought regarding the locavore obsession with buying only locally, that farmers or the distribution system has to go around to so many places that, in fact, the carbon footprint may be much broader than we think it is.\n\nSheraton:  Well, all these people in Union Square, they come down four days a week in big trucks.\n\nQ:  That’s a lot of driving.\n\nSheraton:  That’s a lot of driving, and what is that doing to the carbon footprint?\n\nQ:  Well, I guess that also raises the question of to what extent chefs, home cooks need to think about the planet at the same time that they are purchasing, whether we should only eat sustainable fish or fish that are sustainably raised.  I’m just not sure that the consumer is ready to process all of that.\n\nSheraton:  I don’t think so either.  The consumer has a lot to deal with just putting food on the table and paying for it and satisfying everybody in your family, and getting it done.  I go to many markets to shop for dinner, but I love to go to food markets.  That to me is fun.  That’s my exercise, buying food.  [laughs]  But there are not people like that.  There are people for whom it’s a terrible task, they hate it, they don’t have time for it, there’s pressure, and they want to go to a supermarket and get it all there and send it home or buy from Fresh Direct, which to me is just an unimaginable idea, to buy something I haven’t picked out, but it comes across the street several days a week.  People in the apartments buy it.  They’re too busy.  They call an order in, the food is left with the doorman, and they’re happy.\n\nQ:  You know they do have this, at least when I looked at it, this aspect of the Fresh Direct website, where they’ll give you recipes and tell you exactly what you need to buy.\n\nSheraton:  Right.  And they’ll send you cooked food.  Fresh Direct delivers prepared dishes.  Then the question of localvore is, what about organic?  Not everything at the Union Greenmarket is organic.  It may be local, but not organic.  So then what do you do if you can only get organic strawberries from California?  Are you going to buy that or are you going to buy the local?\n\nQ:  It’s a conundrum.  It definitely is.  When you were at Time, what kinds of pieces were you writing there?\n\nSheraton:  That was after the New York Times, and I did a lot of reporting on trends.  I did a whole big issue that was a cover story on new American food.  That’s when American chefs were beginning to have the status, Lydia Shire and Barry Wine, and all over the country there were American chefs who were being lauded.  So this was a report on that, how it came to be, how they were, and so on, because, you know, American chefs didn’t have status originally.  Even at the Four Seasons, Albert Stockli was Swiss, and anyplace that wanted to be anything needed a chef with a foreign accent, unless it was a steakhouse or something like the Coach House, which was always a really fine restaurant with American chefs and so on.\n\nQ:  So new American food also meant new American chefs.\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  It meant the New American cuisine, which was a blend and fusion, and that the chefs were American.  I did a special one on women chefs, which was getting pretty new, but by that time there was Susan Spicer and Lydia Shire and Cindy Pawlson and so on.\n\nQ:  We’re talking, at least for New American, late eighties, early nineties?\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  I left the Times in ’83 and immediately went to Time, ’84, and I was there for five or six years.  Then I would report on chains.  For example, chain restaurants that are being planned usually have a pilot restaurant somewhere to test the format, and I thought it would be fun to go to a bunch of the pilots, so I contacted where I found them and reported on what was on the drawing board for your dinner.  Every once in a while there was a phenomenon like cinnamon buns suddenly took over in a crazy way, so I did a story on the cinnamon bun phenomenon.\nI did a story on the twenty-fifth birthday of Lutèce, of this restaurant that had begun, and André and his mother in [unclear].  I did a very interesting story—I think it was the first one for the Consumer Press—on the taste laboratory at Yale University, with Linda Bartoshuk.  I went up there for a few days and found out really how they test your palate.  When you say it’s sweet, it may be sweeter for you than it is for me, and so on.  That was an interesting story.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you explain what they do there.\n\nSheraton:  It’s very long.  It’s in my book.  They don’t do it there now anyway.  She’s down in Florida.  This is a sensory laboratory that uses the material not for food companies primarily, but they use it for neurological tests.  It is possible, if you have a constant taste of bitter in your mouth, that some part of your brain is not working property.  So it’s a diagnostic test for other neurological impediments.  There was also sound and sight, but I was in the taste part.\nThey had a really crazy Rube Goldberg setup of troughs.  There were many aspects, but one was a trough, and you’d have your chin on a ledge and your tongue is out, and they wash flavor stimulants over the tongue, and you have to identify them and you have to identify the intensity.  Like on a scale of one to ten, ten is the strong, two is the—then they had a pure recognition test, which was another way, what do you taste.  Then they had a relative test, if you were hearing a noise, seeing a light, and tasting this taste, would the intensity of the flavor match the intensity of the light and the sound, so that you had to do that comparative, because there is a theory that all senses decline at the same rate after the age of fifty, all other things being equal, I mean if you weren’t nearsighted to begin with or hard of hearing to begin with, and so on.  So that doesn’t always happen for everybody, so there was a correlation.  A lot of them would test to see if you really knew what you were doing.\nThen I went to their convention for this story.  They had a convention in Sarasota, where they had even more discussions of taste and perceptions, and are we the only animal that seasons food.  For example, we are the only animal that would taste again something we dislike very much on a first taste.  Things like that, that I found fascinating.  It was a very, very interesting story.  A lot has been written since, but that was the first time it went to a consumer.\nThey tested me, as a critic, to see if I was a super taster.  A super taster exists in two tastes, bitter and sweet.  Or maybe it was also—no, I think it was bitter and sweet.  I was not a super taster; I was a normal taster, which was a great comfort to me because I thought if I’m a super taster, nothing I’m saying in my critique—but it really means if you like bitter broccoli and I say this is too bitter to me, the truth is it may not be as bitter for you.  Your threshold may be much higher for bitterness.  So I found that absolutely intriguing, and I still am in touch with Linda.  We still talk about this.  I’m going to be part of their program in Boston next year.  She’s now down in Florida.  But it was used, even though they finally did some work with people doing artificial sweeteners and so on, it was really neurological and it was part of the Yale School of Medicine.\n\nQ:  That, of course, was quite different from what these pilot restaurants were trying to do.\n\nSheraton:  They were just trying a format.\n\nQ:  A format that would sell and that would be broadcast—\n\nSheraton:  Right.  And work out the kinks and work out the—\n\nQ:  For a fairly wide public.\n\nSheraton:  Right.  There was one that was really very inexpensive and quick.  Then there was one that was really almost a white-tablecloth restaurant, with a pretty good menu that they felt they could do through the State of California, kind of grill.  I think it was called The Grill.  And one was by Jay Chiat of Chiat Day, who was working with some graphic people on one.  I don’t know that any of them ever happened.  There was really a big mix of stories that I did for them.\n\nQ:  I’m just thinking that the fact that Time magazine had somebody writing about food on a regular basis is interesting in itself.\n\nSheraton:  They did before me.  They had a man named Michael Demarest, who used to write on other things, but he wrote on food.\n\nQ:  I think he was the business editor or something.\n\nSheraton:  He was something else.  Then when I got there, it was very difficult.  I hated being there.  I hated the way they edited.  I was never happy there for one minute.  I just didn’t like the way they edited.  It was very heavily edited, and they had a perception of what made it a Time story and so on.\n\tThen I also did some pieces that were fun.  There were some presidential nominating conventions, and there was one in Texas.  I went down and did a story on where are you going to eat in Texas, but I did it by interviewing Dallas—the two stars of Dallas.\n\nQ:  The television program.  I see.\n\nSheraton:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Larry Hagman.\n\nSheraton:  Where does J.R. Ewing eat, and where does Suellen Ewing?  I ate with Larry Hagman and with the woman who played Suellen.  We had lunch together, and they were really funny.  So that was a funny story.  I did one on L.A. when the Olympics was going to be there, called “Going for the Pastrami,” and it was where people were going to eat.  So there was some of that.  It was a big mix.\n\nQ:  I guess caring about the food in places like that or at ballparks, that’s something that—\n\nSheraton:  By the way, they sent me to China for a month, Time.  That was the best part.  Henry Grunwald had taken a news group to China, and the food was so terrible, he said, “I want to send Mimi over and find out why the food is so terrible.”  So I had my own interpreter guide through three weeks in China, then I went to Taiwan for a week, just to compare.  It was fabulous.  It really was fantastic.\n\nQ:  Throughout this period of time, you’d flown around a lot, so you must have watched the development of airline food.\n\nSheraton:  I watched it so much that for the first issue of the Condé Nast Traveler, which I was working for by then—that was the same time I was working for Time—Harry Evans asked me to fly around the world business-class on as many airlines as I could.  Every leg had to have a major meal.\n\nQ:  But it was business-class.  [laughs]\n\nSheraton:  Right.  Because that was the level he thought his readers would be traveling.  I had a Polaroid and I photographed all the meals.  It was really hectic.  So I had a big look at airline food, which is now sort of moot because there is no more airline food.  I guess on those foreign transatlantic flights there is, but I haven’t had them in a long time.  They were better than economy, but some of them were still pretty terrible.\n\nQ:  And a lot of that is because the inhibitions of the cooking process—\n\nSheraton:  They always, to my view, did the wrong thing.  They tried to do something they couldn’t do because of the facilities.  I remember the first ads for Air France after World War II referred to “elegant French service and French food such as you are used to on the great French ocean liners.”  Well, that was impossible, but it had the perception this is very expensive travel.  Therefore, it should be very elegant food.  And they couldn’t do it.  I always thought a great sandwich and a cup of coffee, there’s no flight so long, really, that that wouldn’t hold you, although in those days the flights were pretty long.  I think it took twenty-six hours to go from Copenhagen to Japan when I did it over the polar route that SAS had pioneered.\nBut I’ve done a lot with institutional food.  I did work for a year for NYU Hospital, which was very—I got a new appreciation of the problems with that.  I did a survey of public school food in New York for the Times.  It’s okay to review restaurants, but this really mass-level eating is, in a way, far more critical and really difficult, really difficult.\n\nQ:  You mean to carry off.\n\nSheraton:  To carry off.  The personnel, the unions, the demands, the knowledge, and the cost.  I mean, they spend nothing on school lunches in New York.\n\nQ:  During all this time, of course, you were living here in the Village.\n\nSheraton:  Right.\n\nQ:  So you always had access to pretty good markets, given what was out there.\n\nSheraton:  Absolutely.  Probably the best in the city, with exception maybe of Zabar’s.  We never had that kind of appetizer store down here.  We would go to Russ & Daughters usually, which was always here and not too far away.  We used to have a very good New York Jewish-style deli on Eighth Street.  That moved away; we don’t have that down here anymore.\n\nQ:  When was that?\n\nSheraton:  When I moved into the Village in ’45 until—I don’t know when Davis’s Sea Fare closed.  Maybe the mid sixties.  It was on Eighth Street, just when MacDougal comes into Eighth Street.  Sea Fare was there.  That’s where the first Seafarer restaurant was, on that street.\n\tOne thing I miss—you know, we’ve had a lot of gains.  We have enormous variety in restaurants, we have more skillful cooks, wider range of quality product, but we have lost some things.  One of the things we’ve lost are simple American-style seafood restaurants, where you can get a piece of broiled fish or fried fish or steamed fish or Lobster Newburg, that kind of thing.  I don’t know of one in the city and I miss it, because I used to eat in those kind of restaurants a lot, the Seafarer chain and so on.  But there was even one down there, the Jane Street Seafood Café.  We could go a couple of times a week and have chowder and fish.  The fish has to be something else now, usually all gussied-up in a way they say simple, but it’s not simple.\n\nQ:  You know that part of this project is transcribing memories of James Beard to the extent that it’s possible, and you did see him down here, shopping or—\n\nSheraton:  First of all, when I went to Seventeen magazine as an assistant in the home furnishings and food department, I went, I remember, to a press luncheon, because I wrote about appliances.  This was 1949, 1950.  Appliances after World War II were just beginning to come on the market, and at that time he did publicity for a company, Presto Deep Fryers or something, and because of his appearance, and I guess he had been an actor and he had already perhaps by that time worked with André Soltner at Lutèce with the cooking school.  I don’t know the exact dates on that, but somebody does.  So he was kind of a front man.\nI was invited to a luncheon, it was at the Brittany on Ninth Avenue, the old Brittany, and in demonstrating the cooking from this whatever machine it was at that time, I had snails for the first time.  I was about twenty-two.  [laughs]  So I remember that particularly.\nThen I remember he did another one at the Plaza for Presto Dixie Deep Fryer.  I’ll never forget that lunch.  It was in fall.  I had a table near the demonstration table, and every single thing in the damn lunch was fried.  I was wearing a wool tweed suit, brown.  I remember the suit.  When I came home, I had to send it to the cleaner.  I smelled like Dunkin Donuts.\nSo I knew Jim Beard as a showman and a great poobah of American cooking, but he also lived down here.\n\nQ:  Let me just ask you, when he demonstrated or whatever he did at these lunches, presumably he cooked at these lunches—\n\nSheraton:  Yes.\n\nQ:  —that was a way of making a living?\n\nSheraton:  Yes, of course.  He needed the money.\n\nQ:  Was it considered—of course it depended on how much he’d written by then.  Was it considered inappropriate for him to be doing that?\n\nSheraton:  No, no.  You knew he was a pitchman, and all you wanted to do was see it demonstrated, and then you could decide whether you want to write about it, whether you wanted to order one yourself and test it and say, no, it isn’t, yes, it is.  But I mean, he was obviously a paid pitchman.  Somebody had to demonstrate it.  So that was not as much of a problem.\nHe lived at some point around Twelfth Street and Sixth Avenue.  I’m not sure which building it was, but for a long time I saw him there, and then eventually I moved to that area, so I used to see him in what was then the A&P and is now Food Emporium, Balducci’s on Saturday morning.  Craig lived on Thirteenth Street, Craig Claiborne, over a restaurant, one of the newer-type Chinese, called the Mandarin House, which was, again, northern cuisine with a garden.  John Clancy lived on Sixth Avenue and Eleventh Street; he was a big cooking school teacher, writer.  So everybody was at Balducci’s Saturday morning.  You could say, “What are you buying?  What are you buying?” and so on.\n\nQ:  Was that competitive?  Friendly?\n\nSheraton:  Yes, it was friendly.  Jim, I will say, was very, very snobbish about talking to people such as me, who did not get into food under his aegis, who made no obeisance to him as “I owe it all to Jim Beard,” because there were many people who did, Paula Peck and so on, who had either helped him teach or took his courses.  If he didn’t know you, if you weren’t part of the world—not only him, but plenty of other established people in the field.  “Whoever heard of her?  What is she doing?”  And they were not nice about it.\n\nQ:  Was Craig Claiborne that way?  Of course, he was quite—I guess they both were sort of shy.\n\nSheraton:  No, I don’t think Craig was that way.  I think if what you did was good—I mean, I never had a really personal conversation with Craig, but I didn’t have the feeling he was that way.  This is incidental to what we’re talking about, he was very unfriendly to me after a while at the Times and for years did not speak one word to me because he felt I gave bad reviews to restaurants whose chefs he had had in the kitchen, writing and lauding, and I was putting down his taste.\n\nQ:  People.\n\nSheraton:  Which I wasn’t doing.\n\nQ:  He thought it was purposeful.\n\nSheraton:  Yes, and it wasn’t.  I believed that when they went to his kitchen, they cooked magnificently, but when an unknown person, which I managed to be for a few years, went into their restaurants, it was not marvelous, and that’s what I was writing about.  So he was in a snit over that.\n\tJim was very catty. Of course, he did a number of things for food that were good.  First of all, he created the profession of a food consultant to restaurants, which I was for a while too, simultaneously with him at Restaurant Associates.  I think he also, because of his appearance, brought attention to food and good food and good cooking.  What I objected to was the commercialism long after he needed to do that.\n\nQ:  Like what?\n\nSheraton:  Planters Peanut Oil.  I don’t know if he was an official spokesman, but he certainly was a spokesman for Western Lettuce, iceberg lettuce, and every time I would write something negative about iceberg lettuce, he would talk about “the lettuce snobs” or something like that.\nAnd I also felt that his cooking classes, when he moved into the house on Twelfth Street, because I knew him, as I said, Sixth Avenue and Twelfth, but then the first place I was aware of him cooking was Tenth Street near Greenwich Avenue.  There’s a house that used to be—Sutter’s Bakery on the corner.  It’s now a paper party goods store.  The house next to that was Jim Beard’s.  Then he moved to Twelfth Street.  He taught cooking on Corning Hot Tops, and I thought that was inexcusable, because that’s a very inferior way to cook, and Corning obviously gave him the Hot Tops to demonstrate.  I didn’t think that was a good thing to do.  He pushed a lot of products that way.\nHe had a friend—I don’t know if you’ve come across her name.  Her married name was Agnes White, and she was the wife of William A. White, who was one of the big realtors down here, and she was in the business too.  We bought this house through that agency.  She grew up in Portland with Jim, and she got him all the house deals that he got and did the decoration.  She also was the decorator.  She would buy antique things and put them away for a time when she could put them in one of the homes and so on.  She was very good at it.  She was very, very close to Jim because she was from Portland, Oregon.  She died, and I don’t think they had any children.  William is dead.  We used to live in her sister-in-law’s house.  She’s dead.  But I don’t know what there would be on Agnes White.\n\nQ:  I have wondered about the Portland connection, because, first of all, there’s a different kind of food in the markets there.  They seem to be closer to fresh food.\n\nSheraton:  It was closer to fresh food when I was growing up here in New York.  There was only one kind—if you wanted artichokes, you had to buy an artichoke.  There were no frozen artichoke hearts or canned artichoke hearts.  There was no food out of season except lemons and oranges, which came from California.  We had artichoke season, we had asparagus season, we had strawberry season.  A lot of the things were better because they grew better varieties.  For example, Elberta peaches, one of the great peaches of all times, and no longer, as far as I can tell, grown in Georgia.  Maybe there’s a boutique orchard where someone grow Elberta peaches, but I couldn’t find them.  So a lot of that has changed.\nEven from New York, if you lived near anything ethnic and if your mother wanted to cook—of course, that was my father’s business, wholesale food and produce, so I was aware of what came from where and what was fresh, but he brought home certain things that you would not have seen in our particular market in the Jewish neighborhood of Brooklyn.  Eggplants, he would bring them home if there were some eggplants in his place.  And I don’t know how, but my mother knew how to cook all those things.\n\nQ:  So let’s put the Four Seasons in context, then.  Obviously that was a seasonal theme.\n\nSheraton:  Absolutely.\n\nQ:  So how ordinary or daring was it at that particular time?\n\nSheraton:  It was very daring and very difficult, and it lost a bundle of money trying to be that.\n\nQ:  Tell me what you mean by that.\n\nSheraton:  Well, it was very costly and they couldn’t get enough of the price for what it really cost them.  So much was show, so much was giveaway to make their theme.  For example, cheese.  It was very unusual, outside of a French restaurant or maybe certain Italians, to have cheese for dessert.  Americans weren’t going to eat cheese for dessert.  The Four Seasons decided to have a super cheese tray.  It cost them $125 a week, which in 1959, 1960, to throw away the cheese, because people would not buy it.\n\nQ:  And it has to be served at a particular moment.\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  It goes bad and not all of it could be used in recipes.  If you have leftover Parmesan, okay, you can use it, but what are you going to do with leftover Brie?  They were making a statement.  I think now I’m sure restaurants are finding people are not ordering cheese.  I almost never order cheese in a restaurant.  It’s much too expensive.  And Americans like a sweet dessert and they’re not going to order cheese and a dessert, as they do in France.\n\nQ:  And dinner.\n\nSheraton:  Right.\n\nQ:  You were part of the planning of the Four Seasons situation, so did it have the same ethos of “We must do seasonal food”?\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  Not only food.  The uniforms on the staff, the plantings, the color ink that their bills went out on that they typed on, everything changed four times a year.\n\nQ:  And this was Joe Baum?\n\nSheraton:  Joe Baum.\n\nQ:  And his reasoning was what?\n\nSheraton:  That it was going to be the Four Seasons, and they had, as I remember, two major uniform change, summer and winter, and then spring and fall they changed the cummerbunds and the ties.  Then that was the ink they used for their typing and that was everything.  And of course the trees in the room, which it looks just terrible now.  They can’t afford to do it, and they’re doing terrible things.\n\nQ:  When it opened, the two different rooms, even then was there a chic room and a not-so-chic room?\n\nSheraton:  The chic room was the Pool Room.  Nobody wanted to sit in the Grill.  Everyone wanted to sit around the sparkling pool.\n\nQ:  So the fact that there was a chic room or a chic space in a restaurant, how new was that?\n\nSheraton:  Not new.  I think there was always Siberia.  I’m sure that if an unknown person ever managed to get into the Stork Club, they’d be seated in the bathroom.  [laughs]  I don’t think that, and I don’t think status restaurants are new.  I think there were always status—the Colony, Valois.  I think we’ve always had that.  Maybe not so much, maybe not so many people were aware of it, but Pavillon, that had to be status.  If you came in unknown, you could be treated like dirt in Pavillon.\n\nQ:  Presumably there was less money to go to these places too.\n\nSheraton:  Well, there were always rich people.  I mean, they did well.  But I think the expense account lunch brought a lot of new people to these places.  I must say, Chauveron was perhaps the most egalitarian of the really expensive haute cuisine places.  That was a lovely, jolly place.  That was the man who had begun Chambord and then opened Chauveron years later.\n\nQ:  That was very popular, wasn’t it?\n\nSheraton:  Very, very popular, and he opened it for many years down in—what’s the one in Florida?  Bal Harbor? \n\nQ:  Bar Harbor’s in Maine.\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  The one in Florida, not the one in Maine.  Bal Harbor.\n\nQ:  Did you ever take any of James Beard’s cooking classes?\n\nSheraton:  No, but I reviewed them.\n\nQ:  How did you do that?\n\nSheraton:  I reviewed all the cooking classes.  At the Times we were rating cooking classes.  I’d come in and observe the class.\n\nQ:  That’s what I meant.  I see.  What kinds of classes did you observe?\n\nSheraton:  I did 125.\n\nQ:  A hundred and twenty-five.  [laughter]\n\nSheraton:  If I had known when I started out how many there were going to be.  They were any kind you could think of.  There were, of course, French and Italian and Chinese.  They were general cooking.  They were just all kinds of cooking classes, party cooking, convenience cooking, and I did it for three years, but the problem became that anyone who got a negative review didn’t want to let me in the next year to re-review it.\n\nQ:  So they had, we should say, a number of different people teaching those classes, depending upon the specialty.\n\nSheraton:  Well, each school was the specialty.  There were only a few schools that taught different kinds of cooking.  You either had a Chinese cooking school or a French or—\n\nQ:  I was still back with James Beard, and I think he did have—\n\nSheraton:  He had assistants, but I don’t remember if he had other people at that point doing the class.  I don’t remember that.\n\nQ:  Do you remember how often you went to those classes?\n\nSheraton:  His?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nSheraton:  I don’t remember being there more than once or twice.  If you can ever get it out of the archives, they’re all in there, but I don’t know what—\n\nQ:  You mean what the menus were?\n\nSheraton:  What my reports on all of them were.\n\nQ:  I see what you mean.\n\nSheraton:  But I don’t know if online they have archives before—this would have been around ’76, ’77, and I don’t know if that’s online.\n\nQ:  I’m not sure.\n\nSheraton:  And that’s maybe more digging than you want to do.\n\nQ:  Of course, you only went to a few of them, but could you have characterized the crowd?  Was it mixed with people who just wanted to take a course with James Beard and people—\n\nSheraton:  I would say youngish.  Men and women.  It was very interesting that men were going.  And at all of the cooking schools, I noticed that the men were much more serious than the women in certain ways, especially about the tools.  I don’t know, because they were used to carpentry, but they were much more serious about the use of utensils.  They didn’t like things with flowers.  They wanted a really good professional knife or a really good professional sharpener.  They were much more businesslike about that.\n\nQ:  Tell me what food-related things you’re doing now.\n\nSheraton:  I’m doing a book that’s a huge glossary of some of my favorite foods.  That’s a very big book.  I can’t tell you more.\n\nQ:  Favorite foods meaning recipes or specific foods?\n\nSheraton:  Foods.  I’m working on a piece for The New Yorker.  I have a couple of things due at the New York Times.  And I’m working on possibly reissuing in updated form a couple of my books that have been out of print for a long time.  I write a monthly column for a new online magazine called tabletmag.com.\n\nQ:  I don’t know what—\n\nSheraton:  Tabletmag, which is a function of nextbook.com.  Nextbook is a liberal Jewish cultural website dealing with arts and culture, and their magazine now is called Tablet, and I’m the food columnist.  I do that once a month.\n\nQ:  You do whatever you want to do?\n\nSheraton:  I submit ideas and say, “How do you feel about this?  How do you feel about that?”  Because in relation to what else they know they have coming down, and I’m feeling my way.  I’m only working on the third one.  While it’s of Jewish interest, it doesn’t have to be only about a Jewish subject.  I had one on bread and salt and a little bit about why and what they mean practically.  The second one I did was on the phenomenon of kosher South Indian vegetarian restaurants who have gone the extra mile and gotten mashgiach and certification.\n\nQ:  That is the extra mile.  Wow.\n\nSheraton:  There are about seven in New York.  I found five in Texas, two in Seattle, one in Cincinnati, and I’m sure there’s more that I have not found.  I can’t believe there isn’t one in L.A. and maybe Cleveland or Boston or somewhere in Florida, but I wasn’t able to find them, and this was enough to—because it wasn’t a review of the restaurants; it was the phenomenon, how it came to be and how you order in one if you go.\n\nQ:  And in Little India are there any?\n\nSheraton:  I don’t know if they’re kosher in Little India, but there are a lot of them on Lexington Avenue and Twenty-seventh, Twenty-eighth.  I don’t know what you mean by Little India.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nSheraton:  Because there’s a Little India down on Sixth Street, but Madras Mahal is the one I go to, of course not because they’re kosher, but because I love the food.  They are authentically South Indian vegetarian.  They don’t do anything Jewish.\n\nQ:  So it should, in fact, be kosher, but it would have to have the blessing.\n\nSheraton:  Right.  For the really serious people.  There are a lot of Jews who knew it and went, but those who come in with the yarmulke and want to wash their hands before the brucha—and there’s a special basin for that—they wanted the seal in the window.  And because there is no animal product used, except dairy, they don’t even use eggs because they’re appealing to Jains who don’t even want to eat eggs.  And their cheeses are not set with rennet, because that’s not allowed either by Indian vegetarians or kosher Jews, because that’s a meat product.  So there are at least seven in New York that do this.  There’s Madras Mahal; there’s one next to it, Pongol; there’s one around the corner, Chennai Garden.  There’s a very good one out in New Hyde Park.  \n\tBut the subject was how do you order.  If you go to one, what do these funny things on the menu mean?  So it had a glossary.  It named the few around the country that did it, and how it got started and who goes there, yarmulke and saris.\n\nQ:  This is on tablet—\n\nSheraton:  Tabletmag.com.\n\nQ:  You have interesting and I think quite intelligent theories about why Chinese food has been popular with Jews.  Is there any connection with this Indian thing?\n\nSheraton:  No.  There have been kosher Chinese restaurants, but they have been abominable because they do fake things, which has also happened with Italian.  Like you order prosciutto and you get corned beef, you know.  I don’t think that’s funny.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  No.\n\nSheraton:  There is one very good one, a couple of good ones in New York that don’t do fake things.  Tevere, for example, does very good Italian cooking, but they don’t do what they can’t do.  There’s no cheese, there’s no fake cream product, you know.\nI think the Chinese Jewish thing, I don’t really know the true answer, but I’ve speculated, as have many people.  I know what is not true is that the reason is the Jews here came to live on the Lower East Side, because my Jewish friends who grew up in Denmark still eat Chinese food on Sunday night.  Jewish friends who grew up in France eat Chinese food on Sunday.  And all Israel eats Chinese food.  [laughs]\nThe food I’m talking about that really got the Jews into it was Cantonese, not so much the latest Szechwan, Hunan.  I think it was cheap, I think it had a lot of soft, mild flavors that Jews of Ashkenazi background like, soft onions, celery, rice, which was very big with Ashkenazi Jews.  Obviously chicken soup with wonton that looked like kreplach, and the drink was tea.  In case you were sensitive, even if you weren’t totally kosher, no dairy products in sight, because the Chinese didn’t use them.  So even if you weren’t kosher, you might not be used to having a glass of milk with a hamburger, you know.  As for pork and shrimp, I think they ate it and it was like, “Who asked you?”  [laughter]\n\nQ:  What do you make of these Indian kosher restaurants?\n\nSheraton:  That’s different.  I think that they’re young Jews who want to eat kosher, but want to eat something different, and it’s more fashionable.  Suddenly they’re having all these spicy things and these gorgeous breads and stuff, and they like that.  They’re tired of chopped liver or whatever they’ve been eating.  That I think is very different, and it’s kosher.  The Chinese places [unclear] kosher.\n\nQ:  Oh, I see what you mean.  Yes.  And what are you cooking now?  What kinds of things are you cooking?\n\nSheraton:  When I cook mostly at home, it’s really quite simple because we try to make up for the food we eat in restaurants.  Yesterday, for example, I cooked outside in the garden for our son and daughter-in-law and granddaughter, and I did Middle Eastern.  I did shish kabob, and with the shish kabob I did some tabbouleh and some baba ghannouj, and I had a little rice pilaf with it.  I do a lot of Middle East.  I love Middle Eastern cooking.  I spent time in Beirut with a chef and so on.\nIn the fall and winter I do a lot of Scandinavian and German.  I wrote the German cookbook, so I like that food.  I spent a lot of time in Scandinavia.  Christmas is always Danish.  New Year’s Day party, when I do it, is always Swedish Danish smorgasbord.  I do French country cooking.  I don’t like to do haute cuisine, but I do a daube or a boeuf bourguignon or those things.\nI would say the running thread is Italian, especially when my son was home as a child, my husband’s Italian, we like it, it’s easy, it’s healthful.  Everybody likes it.  You can make it taste good quickly.  Then, of course, Eastern European Jewish food, stuffed cabbage.  Passover, I make the gefilte fish and the matzo balls.  Rosh Hashanah, I always make a honey cake.  I don’t do anything religiously about it, but only the food.\n\nQ:  It’s a very good restaurant, this house.  [laughter]  Has your husband enjoyed this wonderful journey?\n\nSheraton:  Yes.  I don’t think I could have done it if he—there’d either have been a divorce or give up [unclear].  When I was on the Times doing every night, I will say there were times he was pretty tired of it and got a little bit cranky, and I used to say, “Don’t go.  I’ll go with somebody,” unless his own business had him at a business meeting.  And he traveled quite a bit in those days.  Then I would take other people.  We were usually four people anyway, reviewing for the Times.  No, he loves food and he’s interested and likes all kinds.  He complains that he always gets to order last because I let the other people choose.  I’ve had my first choice in so many years.  [laughs]  Or he likes when we go out for special occasions, for us to order the same thing, and I hate that.  I think it’s such a waste.  “Couldn’t we eat the same thing for once?”  [laughter]  But he likes my cooking and his father liked it.  His father was a very old man who finally lived here at the Village Nursing Home, and once or twice a week I would make some Italian meat sauce on fusilli or meatballs, and Dick would take it over to him.  He liked that very much.  I love doing Italian cooking, and I have a very good, if you could say, ear for it.\n\nQ:  I can’t imagine you in a nursing home, but if you ever get there, I’m sure the food will be very different.  [laughter]\n\nSheraton:  I’ll kill myself before they kill me.\n\nQ:  Mimi, thank you so much for this.\n\nSheraton:  You’re welcome.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSheraton - 2 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n","description":"Mimi Sheraton is a writer, critic, and cookbook author perhaps best known for her transformational work as a restaurant critic at The New York Times from 1975 to 1984.

The daughter of Walter White, the executive director of the NAACP from 1931-1955, and Gladys White, Viazzi grew up amid the optimism and pride of the Harlem Renaissance. TTT\n\nInterviewee:  Jane White Viazzi \t\t\t\t\t\tSession #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judy Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t\t     New York City\n\nDate:  March 25, 2009\n\n\nQ:  This is Judy Weinraub.  I’m with Jane White Viazzi in her Greenwich Village apartment, and we are about to record our conversation.  Good afternoon.\n\nViazzi:  Yes, we are.  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  How are you?  Why don’t we start by your telling me a little bit about where and when you were born and something about your childhood.\n\nViazzi:  All right.  I was born in New York.  I am one of the very, very few people who was ever born in New York instead of coming to it.  I was born in a sanitarium up in Harlem on 137th Street and what was then Lenox Avenue.\n\nQ:  And what was the sanitarium?\n\nViazzi:  It was called the Edgecombe Sanitarium.  \n\nQ:  It wasn’t a full hospital?\n\nViazzi:  I wasn’t a mental case.  [laughter]  But anyhow, it had a—well, we will diverge straight away because the sanitarium had a very interesting history.  It was a small, maybe four-, five-floor building that had been bought by pinching and scraping by a group of black doctors who ostensibly were associated with Harlem Hospital.  But Harlem Hospital—I’m speaking of the late nineteen hundreds, 1919, 1920, ’21—would not permit black doctors to function.  They were there on kind of not even the masthead, but they were formalities in order to meet some kind of law in the city of New York.  But they couldn’t—I mean, surgeons couldn’t operate.  These were black doctors and surgeons who had graduated from the really distinguished black medical hospitals, all in the South, actually.  So they put their monies together and bought this building and established the Edgecombe Sanitarium so that they could function.  My family, my mother had her two children, me and my younger brother.  She had a thyroid operation in that hospital, and I remember it as being, well, rather like a country hospital.  It had plank flooring and sheer white curtains at the windows, and the air blowing the curtains in and a great smell.\n\nQ:  It sounds quite nice.\n\nViazzi:  A lovely place, a lovely kind of simple place, you know.  Of course, a lot of medicines and developments in medicine hadn’t even been thought of yet.  And it was not a deprived place.  It was just a very simple sanitarium.\nBut they were very famous, this group of doctors.  At the head of it was a doctor Louis T. Wright, who came from Atlanta, Georgia, the same way my father did, and was a distinguished surgeon and was finally appointed by the then mayor of New York as the first black police surgeon on the police force of this city, and also he became the chairman of the board of the N.A.A.C.P.  So it was all kind of interrelated.  But he was our family doctor, and that’s where I was born.\n\nQ:  Now, for the record, tell me your parents’ names.\n\nViazzi:  My parents’ name, my mother was Leah Gladys Powell White.  She was born in Philadelphia.  She was a twin.  She never went to college.  She went to school in Philadelphia and took stenography courses, so she was adept as a stenographer and secretary.  My father was Walter Francis White, although he dropped the Francis, born in Atlanta, Georgia, who became, between the years 1931 and 1955, when he died, the executive secretary, the national executive secretary, of the N.A.A.C.P.\nHe succeeded James Weldon Johnson in that post in 1931, but he had been part of the New York N.A.A.C.P. since 1919, when he emigrated from Georgia at Mr. Johnson’s behest, because Daddy was a really energetic pro-civil rights worker even before they were known as civil rights.  He was always on those battlements, and he had been part of the Atlanta branch of the N.A.A.C.P.  All the cities were developing their own branches that dealt mostly with local problems, but then would refer them to the national office.  And his particular pursuit there in Atlanta was against some kind of teacher exclusion of black teachers from the local schools there, and James Weldon Johnson recognized him for what he was and imported him to New York.\nIn the offices of the N.A.A.C.P., my father met this really gorgeous woman, and they married in 1922, and I was born really very quickly thereafter, shall we say.  [laughter]\nSo I lived all of my life in New York.  I went to a local school, which was part of the whole Ethical Culture spread of schools.  They were progressive schools.  And Daddy, through his connections, leaned on the school—this is shortening it—to open up its school register to black students.  And in this case, I was, as I also was later at Smith College, kind of the guinea pig.  I say that with no rancor.  I was the guinea pig.\n\nQ:  Let’s go back for a second to your family house.  Your parents are often referred to as being important figures in the Harlem Renaissance.  Does that ring true to you?\n\nViazzi:  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, yes.  Daddy wrote a couple of novels, and the first one, Rope and Faggot was the first, I believe, and then he wrote a subsequent Flight —I can’t see them here.  I have obviously—\n\nQ:  We can check.\n\nViazzi:  You can fill that in.  \n[White’s novels were The Fire and the Flint (1924) and Flight (1926). He also wrote A Man Called White (1948) and How Far the Promised Land (1955). Rope and Faggot (1929) was a biography of Judge Lynch]. \n[unclear] Which by some assessors of the Harlem Renaissance gave him the credit for having started the whole thing by publishing that book. H.L. Mencken was a great fan of his.  Carl Van Vechten was a great fan.  And Daddy was responsible for bringing a lot of those people who didn’t have a clue about Harlem.  It was like going up the Congo River, you know, to see some native tribe.  But he opened up that society that was up there, and I’m speaking of a really sophisticated society, but outside of the boundaries of white society at the time.\n\nQ:  I’ve read that there were a lot of receptions and parties and things like that at your home.\n\nViazzi:  Parties like mad.  I mean, we’re talking of the twenties, for heaven sakes.  For all I know, bathtub gin, but not from our bathtub, I don’t think.\nMy mother, as I say, was this great beauty whom people would visit, you know, would try and get on the invitation list to these parties, which were held in many people’s apartments, but very importantly in ours in 409 Edgecombe.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nViazzi:  And Sergei Eisenstein came to one of the parties, and thereafter pronounced that Gladys White was the most beautiful woman he ever saw.  Isn’t that heaven?  [laughter]\n\nQ:  It certainly is, and I believe it.\nNow, since this project is in the service of our perceptions about food and how that’s changed, were you allowed to be part of the parties?  Do you remember what the food and drink were like?\n\nViazzi:  Yes and no.  It was speaking of, what, 1928 and into ’32.  So ’28, I would have been six years old, so I was locked up in the back room.  My brother was then two, so we were not privy to the parties.\n\nQ:  Not drinking bathtub gin, yes.\n\nViazzi:  When it got to ’32, then I was ten years old, and they would let me out occasionally.  I remember the crush of it all and the sounds of it all and the kind of raucous engagement with each other, white and black.  There was something kind of dangerous and wonderful about that mixture, because that was not going on below 110th Street, believe you me.  It started to be reciprocal that black people would be invited down to a select party, often in the Village, you know, because the Village has always been sui generis.\n\nQ:  Did your mother cook for these parties?\n\nViazzi:  She must have done, because we had no servants.  For a short time, we had a helper who lived, I believe, well, if not in the building, at least near the building, and needed—she had a child of her own.  I’ve forgotten what her name was.  I wrote it down because it came to me once, and now it’s disappeared again.  But she would come in to help with the parties, but I don’t think she did the cooking.  I think my poor mother did all this stirring of huge pots and whatnot.\nI don’t seem to have a memory of the food served in our house, but I remember it when my parents used to start including me when they would go within the building to, for instance, the painter Aaron Douglas’ house.  He and his wife, Alta, had a smaller apartment within that building, and I remember being included, you know, when my parents would go downstairs to their apartment, and I remember huge tables of food.  It was rather like southern black food.\n\nQ:  So this was an apartment building or a house or—\n\nViazzi:  This was the apartment building into which we moved in 1927 when I was—well, I was five by the time we came back.  In 1926, my father got a fellowship enabling him to write—\n\nQ:  These books.\n\nViazzi:  —these books.  He was also given the choice of any other country than the United States, and that was so that he could concentrate on it, otherwise, because he was already associated with the N.A.A.C.P.  But he took leave of absence, and he was no fool, so we moved to France, didn’t we?  [laughs]  Either that or Italy, but he chose France.  France, of course, in the mid-twenties was terribly in, and we lived on the French Riviera in Ville Franche, a real villa overseeing the Mediterranean.  I mean, this all seems like—\n\nQ:  Not bad.\n\nViazzi:  Not bad at all.  It seems like I’ve made it all up, but I didn’t.  And the thing that drove them out in about eight or nine months, because we weren’t there for an entire year, was even though the villa rented for something like a hundred dollars a year or something minimal, it got to be too expensive on the money from this fellowship or this grant, and the Riviera got to be very kind of the place to go, so all the merchants and the shops upped their prices, and it got to be prohibitive for my parents.\nSo we came back in—I don’t know.  I had my fifth birthday on the terrace of the villa.  It was called Villa Sweet Home.  Isn’t that to die?  [laughs]  And I remember balloons and a cake in the sunlight on that lovely terrace overlooking the Mediterranean, and I thought, “Well, this would be my life.”\nBut in August—that was October, and by July or August, the money started to run out and the whole thing soured, so we came back.  By that time, Daddy had returned to the United States because he had to take up his work with the N.A.A.C.P. again, and it just came to an end, not an unpleasant end, but an end.  When we came back, my mother, brother, and I, I was five, my brother was, what, four.  He was just a little—he was one year old, if that.\nDaddy had found us this magnificent apartment in 409 Edgecombe, which is at 155th Street and Washington Heights, I guess is the area.  It’s reputed to be the highest bluff in the city of New York.  Superb tripartite apartment building with wood floors and candelabra and molding and, I mean, you name it.  We were very fortunate, we children, you know, to move in there.  And we lived there from, what am I speaking of, 1927, in various configurations, until my mother left it in ’65.  So that’s, what, thirty-odd years, whatever.\n\nQ:  So that was your home base when you went to school and when you went to college.\n\nViazzi:  Exactly, yes.\n\nQ:  So you went to school first—\n\nViazzi:  At Ethical Culture School here on—well, there was a sub-school belonging to them in the West 70’s in a brownstone, and then once you got to a—\n\nQ:  A certain grade, yes.\n\nViazzi:  —certain grade or something or other, then moved into that building at, what is it, 67th Street and Central Park West.\n\nQ:  Where it [the Society for Ethical Culture] is now, yes.\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  Then when you got to junior high school, yes, and high school, one went to Fieldston, which is up in Riverdale.  So whatever, however many years that comprises, I had my whole prior-to-college experience at—Algernon Black, who was one of the original pillars of the Ethical Culture School, was a great friend of Daddy’s, Mr. Black and Mr. White, on committees together and whatnot and so on.  But that didn’t affect me one way or the other.  I mean, I didn’t get any privileges out of that.  Actually, what we considered to be the privilege was that I, by dint of Daddy’s hard work, got to be educated there, you know.\n\nQ:  Were there other black children there?\n\nViazzi:  I don’t remember any of them.  I remember a very lonely kind of existence, I think, because I have subsequently talked to people who are associated or were and at least know its history better than I, but there may have been one or two others at some point.  But whether I was—for instance, this is off, and I’ll just say it quickly.  I have a friend who is writing the definitive biography of Lena Horne, and he comes to me and asks me for opinions and judgments and edits and whatnot, and here is Lena claiming that she was the first black child going to Ethical Culture.  And I said, “Wait.  Who am I and who is she?  Now let’s get ourselves straight.”  I don’t know.\n\tHe said, “Well, that’s very—I’ll check on that.”  But then he never got back to me to tell me whether that was so or not, because she went to Ethical Culture in Brooklyn.\nAnd I said I don’t know that there was ever a branch or, you know, another part of Ethical.\n\nQ:  You just helped him with his research.\n\nViazzi:  But anyway, this is apropos of whether I was the only black student or not.  I think for a while there I may well have been and then, you know, kind of the whole thing opened up.\nThen I graduated from there and I went to Smith College, which is under the same kind of aegis of the—\n\nQ:  Was it difficult for you to get in to or be accepted there?\n\nViazzi:  No.  There, again, Daddy had been influential.  He believed profoundly that we should all be educated, whatever color we were, and we should be educated in the best possible way.  So as with all of his aims, they were very high.  I mean, he wasn’t talking about Brooklyn College or something, even though Brooklyn College may be equivalent.  But he was aiming very high and at these institutions that up to then didn’t have a clue about black and white.\nSo the reason I call myself a guinea pig is that he and W.E.B. DuBois, who had a daughter named Yolanda, and Dr. Louis T. Wright, who had two daughters named Jane and Barbara Wright, Jane Wright went to Smith ahead of me, so I was not the first one at Smith.  My cousin, Minnie Gladys White, who was the daughter of Daddy’s elder brother, went to Smith.  She was a summa cum laude magna this and plus that, very, very intelligent.  So we were that kind of, in DuBois’ words, the talented tenth, that were there as role models.  Let’s face it.  And it’s difficult to be a role model.  I mean, you have to watch yourself all the time, just all the time, and you have to watch yourself from the standpoint of what are other people thinking.  Now, is that a chore or not?\n\nQ:  Was there pressure on you to be a young lady or—\n\nViazzi:  All of the above.  But then my mother was a great lady, so she inculcated ladyness in me, which I often have violated.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  That’s a relief.\n\nViazzi:  Oh, yes.  Oh, you better believe it.  She was your white-gloved lady, you know.\n\nQ:  Do you have any recollection of what college food was like at that point?\n\nViazzi:  Of what?\n\nQ:  Of what Smith food was like.\n\nViazzi:  I remember things like rice pudding.  Each house at Smith had its own kitchen and its own cooks, really, not chefs.  I don’t remember it being bad.  It seemed to me to be all right.  Daddy liked a number of southern dishes.  He loved grits, for instance.  He loved ham, you know, fried ham.  He loved rice.  All of those kind of southern starches he liked a lot.  Mother was not a great cook of those things.  I mean, she could do them, but she was not into it.  We were into—really ahead, way ahead of its time—fresh vegetables.\n\nQ:  This was at home.\n\nViazzi:  This is at home under my mother’s hand.\n\nQ:  Do you think there were market stands, or where would she have gotten them?\n\nViazzi:  There were markets.  The markets in my whole period in Harlem through the early sixties, the markets were bad, bad, bad.  I venture to say they have improved some now, but when I used to do the shopping, we’re speaking of in the fifties and the sixties, and—well, the seventies, I wasn’t there.  But let’s say the late forties, fifties, and early sixties, I would have to go like ten blocks or so to a supermarket, and even then it was kind of mini super, you know.\n\nQ:  So it’s interesting that your mother managed to find decent produce.\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  I don’t know where that happened, because I don’t think there were carts, but maybe there were.  I mean, there were produce carts down in the Lower East Side.  Maybe there were in Harlem at the time.\n\nQ:  Did you have the family meals together?\n\nViazzi:  We did, except that Daddy was very—I have a strong memory of his hardly ever being there.  My very strong memory is his packing, or my mother’s packing, a bag for him, having ironed all the shirts and, you know, starched all the this and the that, packing bags and off he went.  He did a great deal—well, there’s the famous case, but this was before I was born, where he ventured into a town in Arkansas to investigate a lynching, and he got newspaper credentials and passed as a white journalist and just barely managed to escape there before the word was out that there was this black man masquerading as a white man there.\nHe was enormously—people who speak of that experience speak rather glibly of it.  “Oh, yeah, he went into the South and masqueraded.”  I always think, and it’s because I’m an actor, I think of the steps in between the cup and the lip.  I think of the terror that there must have been to be staying in some white boardinghouse and to hear people saying, “Well, I hear there’s a nigger down that’s here passing.”  I mean, isn’t it awful?  But, that was the period of like two hundred lynchings a year.  It was a terrible, ugly, dangerous period in American history.\n\nQ:  So growing up against that backdrop must in some way have affected your initially studying sociology at Smith.  Is that right or no?\n\nViazzi:  Well, I did.  Sociology was my major, and that really, yes, that had to do with my exposure and my desire.  I remember having written a very successful term paper for my sociology professor, whose name I will never forget.  It’s Neil deNood, d-e-N-o-o-d.  He was of Dutch heritage, I gather, marvelous man with a little moustache.  And he had asked us for a term paper.  I’ve forgotten was the general subject was, but I chose to write about Father Devine.  Have you ever heard of Father Devine?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nViazzi:  He was an evangelical, you know, before they were—well, Aimee Semple McPherson and he were co-evils in a way.  I wrote this extended paper about the rituals of Father Divine’s meetings with ladies dressed in white, waving white handkerchiefs because the Lord had come.  It was staggering and stunning.  And Neal deNood was very admiring of that paper, and at my graduation, he met my parents and said to them, “How does it feel to have an intellectual as a daughter?”  [laughter]  Well, of course, I am not and never was, but it was nice to hear that.\nAnyway, how’d we get to that?\n\nQ:  Well, actually, there were you at Smith.  So how did it go from that?  How did your passion for the arts emerge and take over?\n\nViazzi:  Because my minor was music.  While I was in high school, I developed this passion for singing.  My mother had a singing voice, a beautiful, really, soprano voice, which she was never able to parlay.  She was in one Broadway show, but she was married and she was pregnant, and so that put paid to that as her career.  But I knew how to sing.  My brother and I were musicians together, you know, kind of inchoate musicians, where on Christmas mornings, like before the birds were up, we would gather outside of their bedroom door and sing every carol you can think of in really kind of, oh, Stravinsky-esque harmony and counterpoint.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Were you trained at that point?  Could you play instruments?\n\nViazzi:  No, no.  This was a natural talent that we both had, which he, my brother, developed into a real profession.  He became a real singer.\n\nQ:  What is his name?\n\nViazzi:  His name was Walter—are you ready to write?  Carl, C-a-r-l, for Carl Van Vechten, Darrow, for you know who, White.  But when he became an opera singer, he shortened that to Carl Darrow.\n\tAnyway, I developed this passion for Marian Anderson.  My parents were great supporters of black artists.  There was a black tenor named Roland Hayes, and there was the fabulous Marian Anderson.  We used to go to Carnegie Hall to hear one or the other.  Well, Town Hall for Roland Hayes.\n\tIn high school, I remember my best friend and I went to some arcade in Times Square, and I made a recording [sings] “He’s got the whole world, in his hands,” I mean, I was so smitten with Marian Anderson.  That sounds just like her, which, of course, you should live so long.  [laughs]\n\tDaddy and Mother were supporters of the arts, and even though Daddy had no talents in that direction at all, oh, he could sing, but, you know, kind of part of the group.  The art of singing and performing was kind of all part of this very complex weave that was the family of the Whites, and somebody with whom, like you, I was sitting, talking to, in an interview said, “Isn’t it interesting that you and your brother, the offspring of a famous civil rights activist, should have both turned out to be in the arts?”\n\tI said, “Yes, isn’t that interesting?”\n\tSubsequently, I thought about it, and I thought, to some extent it was an escape from, you know, it’s burdensome also to be the offspring.\n\nQ:  Were your parents upset when you went in that direction?\n\nViazzi:  No, not at all, except that I made my Broadway debut in a play adapted from her own novel, called Strange Fruit by Lillian Smith, and when it was over, it had a respectable run, but maybe it was eight or nine months, and I was unemployed yet again, I do remember my father and I passing in the corridors of the apartment in 409, and Daddy said, “Well, what do you intend to do with your life?”\n\tAnd I was affronted by that.  I thought, I’ve already shown what my direction.  But it wasn’t as if I could say, “Well, look, Daddy, I’m making a bundle here and I’m very successful, you know.”\n\nQ:  Nevertheless, being in Strange Fruit, I mean, that was an extremely big deal.  Now, that was 1945.\n\nViazzi:  That’s right.\n\nQ:  So you graduated when?\n\nViazzi:  In ’44.  June of ’44.\n\nQ:  That’s amazing, going straight to Broadway.\n\nViazzi:  Yes, well, it was June of ’44, and it was like September of ’45, so that’s a number of months.\n\nQ:  Most people don’t make it to Broadway quite so quickly.\n\nViazzi:  Well, that’s true.  That’s true.  But that’s a whole story unto itself.  We’ll never get onto food and James Beard.\n\nQ:  Yes, we’re going to do that.  But that said, before you met your husband, you had quite a full career on the stage, both as an actor—\n\nViazzi:  I did.\n\nQ:  —and as a singer?\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  I look back on it and I think, well, with all of its kind of attenuation, because there were long periods between everything, of course, now cumulatively, it seems like I was busy every single minute, but I wasn’t, I never became a household name.  Far from it.  I never made a lot of money.  I mean, it would go up and down, my salaries.  But I had a really pure talent, and I used it well and I learned about it.  So I feel no shame that I didn’t make it over the top.  I mean, that would have been better, wouldn’t it?  I would have liked that a lot more.\n\nQ:  But you won awards.\n\nViazzi:  Yes, I did.  But, you know, you look back.  I try not to do that, because then you look back and you think, but it was all just a flop.  Just one flop after another, which I know it wasn’t, you know.\n\nQ:  But flops have enormous impact too.\n\nViazzi:  Because it didn’t pay off.  People have now lost a lot of memory of what those things even were.  I mean, how am I going to explain this?  It’s very spotty.  There are people that I meet, black actresses, who say, “Oh, my god, this is the fabled Jane White.  You started it all for all of us.”  I have them, and then I have the people who say, “And what might you have been in?”  There’s this blank.  They haven’t a clue.  Well, it’s this old dichotomy between because I started out as a black actress and then I wound up really as a white actress.\n\nQ:  And Shakespeare and other classics.\n\nViazzi:  And Shakespeare and all the Greeks.  Oh, I played Clytemnestra in, you know, different plays about Clytemnestra.  I played Iphigenia—not Iphigenia.  Andromeda, the widow, on the stage of the Met.  It was all over the place, and maybe that’s what the problem was.  But it depended on who I met, whether they saw me as limited to a black actress, and then they would reject me because I wasn’t black enough, or they had a really open mind and they said, “I don’t care.  This is an actress of value,” you know.\n\nQ:  Was it difficult to make a living?\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  Oh, yes.  I was on unemployment insurance a lot.  I worked at Lord & Taylor’s at the counter.  I worked at B. Altman’s at the counter.  I was in the glove department there.  It’s been very tough.\n\nQ:  Do you remember whether you cooked for yourself, whether you ate with friends, whether you shared meals?\n\nViazzi:  Because I still lived—I lived with my mother and was her so-called support until I left the house and got married, which was ’62.  So my mother and I would cook.  I usually did the marketing, but she cooked.  And the things I learned how to do were from her, so I was always a very kind of simpleminded cook.  [laughs]  There was no cordon bleu for me.\n\tWhen I met Alfredo [Viazzi], it exposed a whole new world of tastes and the way to do things.  Early in our marriage—we had a lovely apartment on 9th Street between Fifth and Sixth—I said, “Tonight I’m going to cook dinner,” because there were nights when he would be home.\n\tHe said, “Oh, marvelous.”\n\tI said, “I’m going to do liver, bacon, and onions.”\n\tHe said, “Oh, I love that.”\n\tWell, I made it, and this is terrible to tell about the man, because he’s now dead, but he looked at it and he said—and I quote—“I wouldn’t feed this to a dog.”  [laughter]  Well, I fled to our bedroom.  I cast me self onto the bed.\n\nQ:  Many tears.\n\nViazzi:  Oh, many tears, great flurry and passion of tears.  And then I sat up and I thought, “I know what, I’ll just never cook again.”  [laughter]  Because then when we would be home of an evening, he would cook, and, of course, he knew all about it.  I only started to cook, really, using his ideas and invention and bravery after he died.  I then felt emancipated and that he wasn’t going to sit there and sneer at what I’ve done.\n\nQ:  Well, he was Italian.  There is that problem.  [laughs]\n\nViazzi:  Yes, there is.  Oh, aren’t they awful people?  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Tell me that wonderful story about how you met.  That is such a great story.\n\nViazzi:  Oh.  I was coaching.  Well, along with all of these, you know, Lord & Taylor’s and B. Altman’s, I also would coach, because people seemed to have respect for what I knew.\n\nQ:  This is coaching young actors or—\n\nViazzi:  Young actors, yes.  But not amateurs.  You know, people on their way, either up or down.  For instance, amongst the people I coached for a specific part was Paulette Goddard, so I did pretty good as a coach.  But then I always wanted to elbow them aside and say, “I’ll do it,” you know.  I was always at war with myself, because I really would prefer—it’s not that I believed in that those who can do, do it and those you can’t, teach, whatever that old saw is.  I don’t believe in that, but it would make me nervous.  I’d want to get on the stage myself, and obviously I just wasn’t on as much as I wanted to be.\nAnyway, this young woman, whose name was Elaine Winters, called me up and was preparing for some role that she was going to play or some audition that she was going to give, and said could I coach her in that.  Yes, says I, and Elaine had to take the subway all the way up to 155th Street.  But we had a number of sessions.\n\tShe was married to a guy named Victor Pineiro, and I would ask after Victor, and she’d say, “Oh, he’s doing very well.  He’s about to play Napoleon.”\n\tAnd I’d say, “In what?”  Alfredo had his restaurant at the time, which he had been—this was 1961, I’m speaking of, and I think from like the late fifties, he had owned the Portofino restaurant on Thompson Street and Bleecker.  The restaurant was two rooms, and he had added yet a third, so there were three interlocking rooms, and in the third and farthermost room he had built in a stage that was about as big as this room this way, very small stage.\nBut people like, oh, what was his—George Voskovec was an actor of note at the time, would bring people of his ilk and would bring in playlets or one acts that they had always been intrigued with, and either wanted to act in or direct, and Alfredo started this Monday evening salon, as it is.  When the restaurant would be closed, he would serve a divine spread of supper.  He would invite to it all of his really quite chichi clientele there.  I met Bobby Short there for the first time, and theater publicists, theater composers, writers, a lot of theater people were devotees of the Portofino because Alfredo was at that time already serving this avant-garde Italian food.  He was not a Sicilian, that’s for starters.  He was a—\n\nQ:  I think I wrote down he was from Liguria.\n\nViazzi:  Liguria, yes, right.  I had a blank there.  From a little Genovese town there.  So his cooking, which he claims that he taught himself, because his mother was a bad cook, and they would go to trattorias and he would observe, and he brought this whole kind of French-Italian touch to the foods that he would have his chef prepare.  And people were wild about that restaurant, and the prices were lenient, you know.  It was right around the corner from the Circle in the Square then, which was on Bleecker Street, so a lot of actors would fall in.  So he had a built-in crowd for this Monday night suppers and these kind of experimental plays.  It was kind of like La Mama, you know, but much reduced.  It was really a tiny little space that he was using.\nSometimes he would spend his money really poorly on those productions.  When I joined, and the first play I—well, no, it wasn’t first play, the second play I did there was this shah.  I’ve gotten kind of the dates of this kind of mixed up because the second play was the one that Victor played Napoleon in, and it’s called The Unknown Woman, I think.  It’s about the Napoleon invasion of Italy and some woman who turns up.  They meet at an inn.  It’s George Bernard Shaw.  I don’t know.\n\tBut anyway, why was I about to tell this?\n\nQ:  Well, it was basically how you met him.  So tell me how you became a part of this group.\n\nViazzi:  He bought legitimate maps.  That’s how he ill-used his money.  [laughter]  And that never stopped when we were married.  Yes, go on.\n\nQ:  No, go ahead with that.  How did you happen to turn up at the trattoria?\n\nViazzi:  Well, not at the trattoria.\n\nQ:  At the stage part.\n\nViazzi:  It was not then.  This was the Portofino.\n\nQ:  This was the Portofino.\n\nViazzi:  Yes, which he had until 1963, I think, and then he sold his part of it.\n\tElaine would be telling me about this fantastic young—because he was then not yet forty—Italian who had this restaurant where her husband worked as a waiter, and they were all happy as clams, and the food was so good, and the this and the that.  And I would say, from my distance, “Well, that’s very interesting, my dear.  Now let’s work on this piece.”\n\tAll of a sudden I got a call one day from Victor, and he said they were about to do this cockamamie play by this woman with black hair and green fingernails named Ursule something or other, French-speaking woman, and this was really avant-garde.  About to do this play about a woman who was split in two, and it was to be one actress, and she was visibly—how this was going to be accomplished, I didn’t know, but visibly two different people.  He thought to call me up and put me forward as a suggestion because the actress who was playing it and had been rehearsing it for a number of weeks was named Grayson Hall, and she got her first Broadway play which was a Broadway musical.  Subways Aren’t for Sleeping was the name of the musical.  So off she trotted to Broadway, and here was Alfredo left without an actress.  Victor said, “How about Jane White?”\n\tOne thing led to another, and I really could not resist it.  I mean, the whole idea to read it, in the first place, it was inscrutable, but very taking.  And it was these two halves of this one woman.  Well, what actress was going to turn that down?\nThe costumer was—he developed—what was his name?  Bob—well, whatever.  He co-wrote Bobby Short’s book.  Oh, well, it doesn’t matter.  Bob McIntosh, Robert McIntosh, who had designed some dresses for Lena.  Lena’s and my lives have met from time to time.  He came up with this idea of two different facial expressions, one was terribly pure and, you know, rather bland and a pale lipstick.  The other was darker, with eyelashes and a red slash of lipstick, and this was half of a white nurse’s outfit with one clunky white shoe.\n\nQ:  Nurse’s shoe, right.\n\nViazzi:  And the other was, you know, a spike heel and this black slinky dress.  Well, aside from Alfredo, it was the most marvelous acting experience, and at one point, I even thought, well, I can’t do it anymore because of my arthritis, but I even choked myself, you know.  It was bizarre.\n\nQ:  And you played this for how long?\n\nViazzi:  Well, these were not long runs or anything, because they were only maybe— \n\nQ:  No, but was it every Monday?\n\nViazzi:  Oh, maybe three, four Mondays, perhaps.  And in the course of that, this owner and I started to spark at each other, so he right away conceived yet another evening or two of plays, one of which he wrote.  And the other one was—I don’t know.  But these plays, these evenings, I remember, François Truffaut came one night to it.  He doesn’t seem to have been struck with my acting ability, but he did remark on my tits, that they were wondrous.  [laughter]  Well, that was good enough for me.\n\nQ:  And very French.\n\nViazzi:  And very French, oh, yes.  Oh, God knows.  So, I don’t know, it was this wild period.  This was like November of ’61, and then by May of ’62, we were married.  So that’s—what is that?  November, December—\n\nQ:  Pretty quick.\n\nViazzi:  —January, February, March, April, May, yes, six months.\n\nQ:  Did you learn much about Italian food in the process?\n\nViazzi:  Well, you know, even when I wasn’t where the play was not doing, I would go down.  Increasingly, we would either eat out.  One of his favorite places was Café—what was it?  Oh, up in the East Fifties.  It was a great romantic place for us.  Somebody mentioned it just recently.\n\nQ:  It was French.\n\nViazzi:  French, yes.  Café—\n\nQ:  We can look that up.\n\nViazzi:  And I would eat at the restaurant.  I think I told you about the string beans.\n\nQ:  Tell me again.\n\nViazzi:  That there were these various cortoni with whatever I was eating, and here was this green heap of something.  I said, “What are these?”\n\tAnd he said, somewhat surprised, “Those are string beans.”\n\tWell, this will tell you what the difference was between my mother’s cooking, which was your basic, you know, a little butter and salt and pepper and that’s it, and whatever, however these have been done in possible brodo or something or other.  They were to die, they were so great, and so green and so beautiful.  My mother’s string beans, even though they were live string beans, were always a little gray.  [laughter]  A little flaccid.\n\nQ:  I imagine the string beans at Smith weren’t really a whole lot to write home about either.  [laughter]\n\nViazzi:  I happen to like string beans a lot.  I’ve got some in the refrigerator, even as we speak.\n\nQ:  I like them, too.\n\nViazzi:  But he just extended upon this thing which had been kind of base appreciation of food that I got from my family.  It’s not that—well, we didn’t even have McDonald’s then, but we wouldn’t have gone to it.  I mean, we never even went to a Nedick’s, I think is what they used to have.  We were really basic food people.  But this was this layer of sophistication and of seasoning that was extraordinary. He claimed—I think, he’s got it in his book, because he published two cookbooks with—oh, god.  Jason—\n\nQ:  Epstein?\n\nViazzi:  Jason Epstein, yes, was his own very editor.  I mean, Jason edited his books himself.\n\nQ:  What were the books about?\n\nViazzi:  About cooking.\n\nQ:  Italian cooking.\n\nViazzi:  Oh, I can’t go over there.  One of the—\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  You’ve just shown me now Alfredo’s books, Italian Cooking and Cucina e Nostalgia.\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  And Cucina e Nostalgia is like memories of his, intertwined with foods that he ate, recipes that he suggests, wines to accompany.  It’s a really lovely book, and it’s partially autobiographical, really.\n\nQ:  These look like lovely books and also books that were kind of ahead of other people in producing similar memoirs with recipes.\n\nViazzi:  Well, yes.  His books just anticipated this flood of cookbooks, where there are people writing books who can barely boil water, it would seem, Rachel Ray and all of that nonsense.  [laughter]  His customers, particularly, who came from all over the country, I mean, he’d get calls from San Francisco, people who wanted to come in next Thursday.  But we’re speaking now of the trattoria where we’ve updated into the seventies.  He sold a lot of these.  They’re out of print now, but he sold a lot of them, mostly to his customers who wanted to recreate exactly those tastes.  They are rather complicated.\n\tI used to laugh because he would be in the house when sometimes I would have at his beef whatever, and I would yell upstairs and say, “Do you put some heat on that, or salt?”  He would come downstairs or come upstairs, wherever, and kind of take a hand.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Now, before we get to the trattoria, take me back to the other restaurant and then your going to Rome.\n\nViazzi:  We married in ’62.  Came ’65, it was a combination of things.  Having disembarrassed himself of the trattoria, he then opened a restaurant called L’Aventura on 59th Street, under the 59th Street Bridge.\n\nQ:  In ’65.\n\nViazzi:  In, well, I guess, in ’64.  Yes.  I was part of, I remember, stripping that eighty-foot bar.  It was an old bar and back room, and we redid the whole thing from scratch, and he created this quite magical place called L’Aventura.\n\nQ:  In the Village or uptown?\n\nViazzi:  No, no, no.  This was 59th Street, under the 59th Street Bridge, I mean facing the bridge.  It was not a success.  The director with whom I was working on The Trojan Women, Michael Cacoyannis, was a great frequenter of L’Aventura because it piqued the imagination, you know, in strange ways.\n\nQ:  Now, the movie was about that time, wasn’t it, L’Aventura?\n\nViazzi:  Probably so, Antonioni.  But, no, this means “the adventure,” and that’s—but it was before Alfredo started naming restaurants after himself, so it was not Alfredo’s Aventura.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  What was different in terms of the food there?\n\nViazzi:  The difference was—this was one of his misjudgments.  He got himself a French chef for some reason, and his ex-customers from Trattoria—I mean, from Portofino would come and they’d say, “But, why?”  He never seemed to have quite a reason for that, albeit his mother was French, so it was part of his heritage, but not really.  What he had made his successful name on was Italian.\n\nQ:  And that was closed, Portofino, at that point?\n\nViazzi:  Portofino may still have been open for a while and was then run by Alfredo’s assistant manager, and then she closed it and opened her own place.  But it was kind of a whole change of pace, and it may have had to do with he had a new wife and a whole other life, and it was a mistake.\n\tAfter that, because that had been a flop, I wasn’t working at all.  Even though we had not quite worked out the dimensions of my working on being a wife, I was teaching my own classes then in professional acting, and they were called Jane White’s Classes for Professional Actors at a studio on 14th Street.  I had a nice hunk of people who were very true to—and new people were inducted as students all the time.  But I remember him saying to me, “Well, you can be a wife and a teacher, or you can be a wife and an actress, but you can’t be a wife and a teacher and an actress.”\n\nQ:  It’s a lot.\n\nViazzi:  And, I mean, I was too stupid and too impressed with my marital status to say, “Oh, no?  Yes, I can,” you know.  I have never been a feminist, and to my shame, really, I should have just answered back saucily.  [laughs]  But I gave up the acting, the teaching classes, and I wasn’t hired for any shows, and so there I was, thud, this boring woman with this lovely new apartment and him off, you know, building a new restaurant.\n\t[John F.] Kennedy was assassinated, and it all turned dark.  I just got sick and tired of America for various reasons, and, of course, the primary one being was that I was not included in it somehow, you know.  The thing I could do I was not being given the chance to do.\nHe thought he, for his own part, had been—did I tell you he had been a partisan during the war?  Well, he was conscripted into Mussolini’s navy and off he went in as part of the crew of the fleet of submarines called Decima MAS.  His boat was shot out of the water in Messina.  He was invalided, but not dangerously, but enough already in a hospital in Messina.  Then he was shipped up to a hospital in Como, from which he escaped and joined the partisan forces and was a partisan up there in them Como hills for three years.\n\nQ:  And he was young.\n\nViazzi:  In Sicily, he had his twenty-first birthday and he celebrated it.  He remembered that day because he was off of the ship—this was before he was blown out of the water—and he met some young woman on the beach at Messina, and they celebrated together his twenty-first birthday, a rather, you know, poignant— \n\nQ:  Yes, it’s a wonderful memory.\n\nViazzi:  So, anyway, he was not sure he wanted to go back to Italy.  He felt he’d given it his all, thank you very much.\n\nQ:  And he’d come here to—\n\nViazzi:  He had come here because he wanted to come here, and he came here in—the war was over in ’45, me thinks.  I think he came here in ’47 or so, and he had his rounds of being a dishwasher and a this and a that, and he’d married, and he’d had two children and then met me.  He was divorced by then, and we married, etc., etc.\n\nQ:  But he did go into the restaurant business when he came here or soon after he finished dishwashing?\n\nViazzi:  It was the thing that he thought he knew how to do, but he didn’t go into it in the sense of owning one or even managing one; he was simply a dishwasher or something.  And he wrote a novel in Italian, which was translated here by a friend into English, and it was produced as a paperback, and sold quite a few, and it was about his partisan experiences.\n\tSo, we both had very variegated lives with lots of different experiences.  So marriage was not all that easy from the get-go, you know.  It was these adjustments all down the line.  When came an invitation to him to open a kind of restaurant social club in Porto Ercole.  That’s what I couldn’t remember last time.  Porto Ercole.  It was just an insipient chic resort then, and the local nobilita wanted to put up the money and import somebody, and somehow it got round to Alfredo, to come there and open a club restaurant of the highest chic in an old Norman castle, would you believe, up the hill from kind of the port of Porto Ercole.  But the going really chic hotel there was called the Il Pelicano, run by two Brits, and that’s where we stayed when we went over there, went from Rome to Porto Ercole, stayed at the Il Pelicano, and were escorted by these noblemen up the road to this Norman abandoned castle.\n\nQ:  I’m sure it had a great kitchen.\n\nViazzi:  Oh, probably.  Oh, yes.  And lots of warmth and toastiness, too.\n\tWell, it turned out to be prohibitive.  (A), they expected him to put in some money.  Well, we had like twenty cents.  (B), he would have run waterlines from here up the hill into the Norman castle.  (C), electrical lines and telephone lines.  Here were these Contes who didn’t have a clue as to what it involved, and he had to level with them and say, “This is what.”\n\tWell, they began to say, “Oh, well, hmm.”  I don’t think it ever got off the ground.\nSo we then retired to Rome, and that’s where we lived, and we lived hand to mouth there, too.  I mean, hand to mouth in the sense doing one thing and another.\n\nQ:  Did he want to be in the restaurant business in any way, or he just wanted to make a living at that point?\n\nViazzi:  It was just one of his talents.  Whether it was a question of his not having pursued it or that nothing great came of that little novel that he wrote, I think he would have been very happy to have been a writer, but that didn’t happen.  The whole turn of events, as he told it, in connection with originally the Portofino down there on Thompson Street was that he was walking down Thompson Street one evening, and standing out in front of that three-room restaurant, or two-room then, was a friend of his.  And the friend of his said, “Ciao, Alfredo,” and it was all very Italian down there then.\n\tAlfredo said, “What are you doing here?”\n\tAnd he said, “I’m managing this restaurant,” but obviously it was not doing very well because he was standing out on the street.  And he said he invited Alfredo to take over that job of his.\n\nQ:  It must not have been doing very well.\n\nViazzi:  Pardon?\n\nQ:  That’s pretty fast.\n\nViazzi:  Yes, that’s pretty fast.  Everything has been very fast, very fast.  But here I am, I’m living on and on and on, so there, that’s why there are so many memories.\n\tSo Alfredo, always up for a dare, said yes, and he envisioned it using these things that he’d learned and the things that he’d learned not to do, because his mother was not a great cook.  He attracted a chef whose name was Gino, who was also a Ligurian, and he put together this really swinging restaurant where he started what finally evolved in the trattoria and di seguito into a philosophy of Italian food.  The Genovese are very—well, of course, each segment of Italy has really its own cucina, but the Ligurian table is very creative because of its proximity to France, so there’s a good deal of infusion back and forth over the border up in the—\n\nQ:  But when you say he developed his own philosophy, his philosophy of what?\n\nViazzi:  Of quick sauces, for instance.  He didn’t believe in all of this bullshit about you put all of these ingredients and you put it in this thing at the back of a stove and you stir it for three days and then it’s ready, which was the old mama concept, Sicilian concept of a good sauce.  He said all of his sauces are like fifteen minutes tops, with stirring, and they were all enormously fresh and immediate, you know.\n\nQ:  So this would have been both before and after Rome in the restaurants?\n\nViazzi:  Yes, before was the Portofino, and it was kind of the beginning of his—because he wasn’t as practiced in it, but he had these ideas even then.\nAfter Rome, when we came back, which was—well, I came back.\n\nQ:  Yes, you came back for your work.  Tell me about that.\n\nViazzi:  That’s right.  Over there, I had been much admired and much hooted at in the streets.  I did dubbing.  I got into the whole dubbing thing, which was a good thing, because they brought in some doubloons.  I remember going to a studio one day, and this crew of road workers said, “Aye, Sophia.  Ciao.  Come va?” and all of this, screaming and yelling.  Cars would scream up to me on the Veneto and want to know if I wanted to be in a picture, and it was all very peculiar.  [laughs]  But, of course, they wanted bare breasted and on the zero, zero, sette’s yacht.  That was one of the offers.  “You can be on the yacht with zero, zero sette.”  I said, “No, thank you very much,” because I was a legitimate actress and somewhat square, to boot.  But they didn’t have a clue about what that meant.  I mean, actress over there at that time, and maybe still so, was whore.  That’s all.  I mean, don’t come on with your Shakespeare, thank you very much.  [laughter]  But over the years, there have been attempts to establish an English-speaking theater in Rome, and there have been a number of them in succession because they last up to a point and then they totter, because English-speaking tourists are not there to go to an English-speaking play.  As a matter of fact, they’re not there to go to any plays at all.  So they don’t succeed perforce of a lack of attention from the tourist population, and the Italians at the time that we were there, I remember Marcello Mastrianni appeared in some play on, oh, up there near the Villa Hassler on the top of the Spanish Steps, whatever that theater is, and all of the Italian chic turn out for the first night and the first week and—\n\nQ:  Busted.\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  That’s it.  In the second week, the theater is a wasteland.  So they’re not into long runs.  They’re not into sustaining a theater.  They’re not into even showing up if it’s all—so I was part of—his name was Patrick Latronica.  He was an Italo-American, and he transmigrated himself to Rome and established this theater.  And he wanted to do, and did do, “Oh, Dad, poor Dad, Mama’s hung you in the closet and feeling so sad,” by Arthur Calbot.  And he called me up and said did I want to be in it.\n\nQ:  In Rome.\n\nViazzi:  In Rome.  Now, whether this was the first or the second play, I think maybe it was the second thing I did, but anyhow, I did a couple of plays there in Rome.  I was taken out to Cinecitta.  I met Federico Fellino, but he didn’t seem to take to me particularly.  As a matter of fact, there’s irony.  At the end of our interview, he said, “Now, let me write your name down.  It is Jane?”\n\tI said, “Yes, J-a-n-e.”\n\t“Pink?”\n\tI said, “Pink?  No.  It’s White.”  I mean, it’s like my whole life collapsed around me, because pinkie, you know, is a pejorative for pale-skinned black people.\n\nQ:  Oh, in English.\n\nViazzi:  It is, in English.  So where did Pink come from?  I mean, it’s like there are these storms.  This is too inscrutable for you to include, so let us just take it out of the text.\n\nQ:  However, there you did get a call from New York to return.\n\nViazzi:  I did.  I got a call from Ted Mann of the Circle in the Square, because in those years between ‘62 and ’65, I had appeared as Helen of Troy in Michael Cacoyannis’ landmark production of The Trojan Women.  We all came off very well.  Mildred Dunnock played Hecuba.  Carrie Nye played Cassandra.  Oh, I can’t even remember, but it was really spectacular.\n\nQ:  But when you returned to do that, did you know that you were leaving Italy and coming back here?\n\nViazzi:  No, no, no, no, no.  These things, you know, just kind of you turn the page and then it was all—because I was employed then and well reviewed.\n\nQ:  Employed in dubbing?\n\nViazzi:  No, no.  Now, well, you see, it’s hard for you, baby darling, because I’m skipping all around.  Now I backtracked, you see.  We had a backflash there.\n\nQ:  Okay.  But, so, you were in Rome, though, and received this offer from Ted Mann.\n\nViazzi:  Right.  Because he knew of me from our relationship in Trojan Women.  He called up, he said he was doing this production of Iphigenia at Aulis and Irene Papas was playing Clytemnestra in it.  She was about to leave it, and he wanted me to come back to New York and take over from her.\n\nQ:  To replace Irene.  Wow.\n\nViazzi:  I said wow, myself, because he found me in Rome.  It isn’t as if I’d been keeping up with New York.  I figure, well, that’s over, now I’ll be an Italian.  But he found me.  He said, “You’ve been hiding.”\n\tI said, “Not really, but here we are, you know.”\n\tAnd he said, “You must do this.”  It was that fortuitous call at that moment where I thought I can’t go on being just an Italian housewife and being displaced for the rest of my life.\n\nQ:  So you came, and what did Alfredo do?\n\nViazzi:  I came back in February of ’68.  He finished off whatever he was up to at the time.  He and the famous photographer Jerry Bauer—do you know him?  Jerry Bauer lived in Rome then, and Jerry Bauer and Alfredo were involved in a film script together.  Nothing ever came of that, but they had lots of good contacts and whatnot.  So he polished off that work.  He gave away the cat and her babies, because she had gone out and gotten herself assaulted by some big brute.  She had five babies, five, and Alfredo had to birth them babies, so he had to give them, parcel them, out.  He wasn’t about to just abandon them.\n\tSo he came back in May of—what are speaking of?  May, February—\n\nQ:  Sixty-eight.\n\nViazzi:  Sixty-nine, May ’69, I guess we’re talking of.  Or ’68?\n\nQ:  Well, we can check, yes.\n\nViazzi:  Sixty-eight, I guess.  When was Bobbie Kennedy killed?\n\nQ:  Sixty-eight, yes.\n\nViazzi:  And Martin Luther King.\n\nQ:  Because you came back for those two things.\n\nViazzi:  For those two things, back to the same theater, honey.  I remember Ted Mann calling me up to congratulate me because I was quite successful with that Clytemnestra.  Clive Barnes said, “But this woman is more Greek than the Greek,” you know, which I thought was really lovely.\n\nQ:  Excellent.\n\nViazzi:  Ted Mann called up and said, “Will—?”  And I said, “Oh, Ted, who gives a shit?”  Because it just all seemed to go down again, you know.\n\nQ:  However, you came.\n\nViazzi:  However, I was back here, and I wasn’t about to go—I’m not built to be a transplant, you know.\n\nQ:  It’s difficult, and Alfredo was back by then, or no?\n\nViazzi:  Alfredo came back in May and while that play was running, and neither was he ready to go back to his old country.  I mean, he was happier with it.  People were intrigued with him in Rome because he spoke a kind of updated Italian.  He wasn’t speaking the old Dante, you know, that goes on and on and on and on and on.  He got work as a newspaperman in Rome with L’Espresso because his Italian kind of cut through a lot of the verbiage.  Rome and a lot of Italy was on the brink of a real kind of renaissance of its own.\n\nQ:  Interesting.  But back here, it became natural to go back into the restaurant business, or what?\n\nViazzi:  It must have done, because that was all he did.  He managed a restaurant for a friend.  For a while there, we sublet and borrowed apartments, and we lived all over the city because we thought, well, any minute.  Not that I was keen on it, turned out not that he was keen, but we thought that, well, we’ll go back to Italy.  That’s what we’ll do.  It was this period of strange—\n\nQ:  It was a terrible, terrible year.\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  Wayfaring-ness.  We lived—let me see—where did we live?  We lived in two different hotels.  We lived on the Upper West Side.  We lived on the East Side on Lexington Avenue.  We lived all over the place.  We finally, at this point, at this point of decision, we rented an apartment on 15th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenue, and that was the beginning of our settling back down here.  We got a cat or two and so, you know, life started to congeal.\n\nQ:  When did his restaurant empire start to assemble?\n\nViazzi:  We’re speaking of the end of the sixties.  Let’s say ’69.  In ’71, he created the first of the da Alfredo restaurants, of which there turned out to be four or five, I’ve forgotten, not all named the same, so don’t take that literally.  But I guess one day he came home and said, “Do you know what I’m going to do?”\n\tAnd I said, “What?”\n\tHe said, “There’s a store on the corner of Bank and Hudson streets that had been a failed attorneys’ office and then it had been an eatery of some sort, and then it was a designer studio.  It was just a corner that had lain fallow.”  He said, “I want to get some money together and open a restaurant.”\n\t“Fine,” says I, “I guess,” because it involved putting up a wall and building in a kitchen and two restrooms.\n\nQ:  And getting the money.\n\nViazzi:  And the money.  To this day, I don’t know where that came from except from us in some way.  I think I was into mutual funds and things then.  Well, they all went down the tubes.  But it turned out there were people kind of poised waiting to get in the door of the Trattoria da Alfredo, which is what he’d named that first restaurant on Hudson and Bank streets.  It could only seat something like thirty-seven people.\n\nQ:  And what was the menu like?\n\nViazzi:  The menu, god, I probably still have one somewhere.  It was Casalinga.  Things that he ate, you know, when he was a child and he and his family would go out to the various trattoria in Liguria and in Savona.\n\nQ:  So he was really producing regional cooking, regional Italian cooking, in New York before regional became everywhere.  Is that right?\n\nViazzi:  Exactly right.  You said it exactly the way I wish I’d said it.  [laughter]  Yes, yes, yes.\n\nQ:  Did he think it through that way or not necessarily regional, but doing something different?\n\nViazzi:  He always was into doing something different.  As a matter of fact, I think his flops, including L’Aventura, had to do with a kind of previousness, you know…..\n But before he died, he had in mind of a truck that would serve trattoria food, and these—I always think of him when I pass these Halal trucks, because that’s the low, you know, version of what Alfredo had in mind, that you get this elegant little paper plate or plastic plate or whatever, of real Italian food on the street, you know.  Or that the truck, you could call up and truck would deliver to an office, because nobody thought of that.  We were still with little go-carts here in this city.  And this was ’87 when he died, and he was full of ideas.  Like, for instance, another one is he conceived the idea of a mechanical dog.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  What for?\n\nViazzi:  Well, I said the same thing.  I said, “But what for?”\n\tHe said, “Because people like to walk with it.”  Do you know that a little fluffy thing that would look real and that would come padding along behind you, they came up with that, like ten, fifteen years ago.  What’s the big toy store there up on Fifth Avenue, was selling those kinds of— \n\nQ:  Well, they’re easier to walk, I guess.\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  And not at all messy to clean up after.  But it was a toy, of course.  But he was all over the lot because his mind was fervent, you know.\n\nQ:  Right.  Back at Alfredo.\n\nViazzi:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Who came?\n\nViazzi:  To the trattoria?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nViazzi:  Well, that was the beginning of the age when limos would pull up in front of Bank and Hudson streets, for chrissakes.  I mean, you know, this was the Village, and people would come down, yes, but they would go to Bleecker Street and some of them very famous cafes and places.  Sicilian restaurants, of course, were flourishing up to that point.\n\nQ:  They were still predominant, yes.\n\nViazzi:  Because there was then still a Little Italy, which, of course, no longer exists, but even beyond Little Italy, the standard of Italian food was Sicilian.  And there’s nothing wrong with that.  I love Sicilian food, but enough already.\n\tSo this food of Alfredo’s really burst upon the scene.  As I think I told you last time, it was such Italian food in his mind that he printed the original menus in Italian, and people would say, “Yes, but, Alfredo, I can’t read that.  What is that?”  And they’d be stumbling and bumbling over it.  So he finally relented and printed it in English.  But then customers would say, “This is so defined, but this isn’t Italian food, Alfredo.”\n\tAnd he’d say, “Oh, yes, it is.”\n\tThey’d say, “But no.”  It tasted like French food to them, because they didn’t know the gradations.  As a matter of fact, an awful lot of people didn’t even have the understanding that there was this thing as regional cooking, you know.\n\nQ:  Now, when did James Beard turn up at the restaurant?\n\nViazzi:  He turned up early on.  Alfredo opened the trattoria in 1971, in, I think, maybe the spring of ’71, and James Beard showed up shortly thereafter, whether he came on his own or he was introduced to it, because Alfredo quickly became the darling of the food establishment.  Gael Greene adored him and even wrote a lovely little tribute to him in New York Magazine after he died, saying things like, “There will never be another.”\n\tJoseph Baum of Restaurant Associates and his wife, Ruth, became aficionados of the restaurant.  Milton Glaser, the graphic artist.  All of the magazine people.  CBS was a great—you know, the whole network were great fans of his.\n\nQ:  CBS was still uptown, though.  It wasn’t downtown?\n\nViazzi:  Pardon?\n\nQ:  People would come downtown.\n\nViazzi:  Oh, they sure would, yes.  And as I say, up till then, you know, people have always come downtown to the Village, but this was like where it was at, honey, this restaurant.  He started out not taking reservations, it’s just, you know, whoever, because he wasn’t even sure it was going to take off.  And the minute he opened the doors, there was—they were Village people, so he thought—and he was in the kitchen initially.  He was the chef, and he had maybe one sous chef and one dishwasher and maybe two waiters.  It was all very modest.  And his prices were always very attainable, you know.  He never got greedy with the prices.\n\tHe didn’t have a liquor license, and he didn’t even want one, because there wasn’t any space to store wines, but when he then subsequently had places that had a liquor license, he never doubled and tripled the cost.  Even his wines were modestly priced, so that was part of the attraction, but it was also this marvelous saporoso, is what he’s—\n\nQ:  What does saporoso mean?\n\nViazzi:  Tasty, full of taste.\n\nQ:  And when did you get to know James Beard?\n\nViazzi:  I got to know him early on because, albeit as of ’71, kind of in the seventies, I worked rather a lot, so whether I was working or not, anyway, the way that he and I for the rest of our lives together would see each other would be at the restaurant, you know, that we’d have dinner together.  So I met all of these people, and I was always—for instance, Ruth Baum, both Baums, actually, and I became very close even after Alfredo’s death.  I used to go to their house in Brewster, and I was always terribly grateful to them for admitting me into that really very snooty restaurant, you know, people.  I mean, theater people are very open, but restaurant people, oh, backbiting.  I’m thinking of Yale and her ilk, you know.  They are not terribly nice people.\n\nQ:  It’s not a terribly welcoming atmosphere.\n\nViazzi:  No, it isn’t.  And I’ve forgotten all of the names, all the magazines.  He had admirers in House and Garden, any of those kind of house magazines.  There was this little white-haired lady, well, I can’t remember any of their names, but they were all—he had a lot of write-ups.  Unless I sent the material off to be part of my archives at Smith, some of it’s in there, but who knows where.\n\nQ:  You have that spectacular picture of the two of you with James Beard.  What were the circumstances of that picture, that photograph?\n\nViazzi:  They loved each other a lot, he and James Beard.  They really admired each other.  So Alfredo hosted a birthday party for James Beard at that restaurant, the trattoria, and he hired a nude streaker.  [laughter]  This guy got out of a cab with an overcoat on and went in the men’s room, and then at one point in the evening when we were all kind of lolling back with cocktails or whatever, this streaker emerges and comes through the restaurant and out into the street in the bitter cold night and leaps into the cab and takes off.  James Beard adored it.  He simply adored it, because they had a kind of wit between them.\n\nQ:  Now, wait one second.  Did he do this knowing that James Beard was going to be there, or just any night?\n\nViazzi:  Oh, no, this was his birthday party.\n\nQ:  Oh, it was his birthday party.  I see.\n\nViazzi:  But Alfredo was hosting for James Beard, so it was a very select group.  It wasn’t, you know, the usual customers.  It was an invited group.  And, of course, James Beard and I always had a secret bonding because he, to the end of his days, thought of himself as an actor, you know.\n\nQ:  Of course.\n\nViazzi:  He had played the part of the baker in Cyrano in the local production in Washington when he was a youth.\n\nQ:  I don’t remember the baker very much, but I’m sure if you say so, I’m sure he was there.  [laughter]\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  One of the coterie of people surrounding Cyrano there is a baker.\n\tAnd he never got over that.  He’s always used it, “Well, you know, Jane,” and so he always—\n\nQ:  Did you have theater conversation at all together?\n\nViazzi:  Yes, and he came to all of the things I did, you know.  There was this huge mound of a man sitting out there in the houses, whatever I did.  When I did a cabaret act, there he was.  One time I took him to the theater because Alfredo was out of town, and we went to see Henry Fonda in the Clarence Darrow play.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  I don’t remember what year that might have been, but all of this is in the seventies, I think.  I had gotten marvelous seats for us.  We were like maybe the second or third row on the aisle, just because, Jim, of course, could not get his legs and feet into anyplace.  So he was sitting there, I was sitting here, there’s Jane and Henry Fonda, and suddenly I realize what I’m hearing on my right side was [snoring].  [laughter]  I thought, “Oh, my god.  How can I—Jim, wake up.”  There was a point at which Henry Fonda even noticed.  He kind of paused and he looked.  So I gave him a little squeeze, and he, of course, sprang to life immediately.  It was a sticky wicket there.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Did you ever go to his apartment, his house, rather?\n\nViazzi:  Oh, yes, we were invited to all of his parties there.  As a matter of fact, he—aha, I hadn’t even remembered this.  He gave the reception, Random House reception, for this first book, 1979.  There we are.\n\nQ:  And that would have been at his house?\n\nViazzi:  At his house and in the garden, and a lovely garden.  For that book, Alfredo—\n\nQ:  For Italian Cooking?\n\nViazzi:  Yes, right.  Alfredo had as his amanuensis when he wrote that, Mel Gussow’s wife.\n\nQ:  Oh.\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  The New York Times’ theater critic’s wife.  What was her name?  Mel and— \n\nQ:  I never knew her.\n\nViazzi:  Not Carol.  Oh, isn’t that strange?  Mel and—well, I don’t know.\n[Gussow’s wife was Ann.]\n\nQ:  When you say his amanuensis, she was helping at the restaurant?\n\nViazzi:  No, no, in writing the book.  She took his notes.\n\nQ:  Oh, I see, I see.\n\nViazzi:  Yes, and transcribed them, because he would say, “Now, how much is like that of olive oil?”  And so she—I did that on this book and, I don’t know, for some reason, I have a facility, and always had the facility and never learned it, of typing in Italian.  It’s because I hear, you know.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nViazzi:  I hear if you say sogno, I know that’s s-o-g-n.  So I typed up all his notes for that second book.\n\nQ:  This looks quite wonderful, actually.  I’m looking at the grapefruit with Marsala honey and crushed Amaretti.  Certainly a great way to dress up a grapefruit.\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  You see there?\n\nQ:  Yes.  Yes.  Easter pie.  Yes, these are interesting.  Because these would all be quite fashionable today.\n\nViazzi:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  I think it’s—oh, well, it’s part of my jaundiced view of history that when you’re dead, you’re dead.  [laughter]  But it’s possible, you know, that any year somebody could rediscover him and those books be revivified.  But I don’t so far know.\n\nQ:  So you ate at the restaurant.  Well, first of all, tell me how many restaurants developed.\n\nViazzi:  All right.  1971 was Trattoria da Alfredo.  1972, I believe, was Caffe da Alfredo, that’s C-a-f-f-e da Alfredo, which it was Perry Street and 7th Avenue.  Maybe ’73 or ’74 was Tavola Calda da Alfredo, and that, too, was an innovation.  That was on Bleecker Street just east of Sixth Avenue.  An innovation because you didn’t just go there and like an Italian tavola calda, you say, “Get me the pollo and the this and the that,” and they package it.  His food was packaged to a point, but with instructions for heating, you know, three tablespoons of butter and put this in that.\n\nQ:  Oh, isn’t that interesting.\n\nViazzi:  And then add this to that.  So it was like people all over the city were known to say, “Yes, yes, I did that myself,” because they felt they had, because they had constructed it in a way.\n\nQ:  Was the entire place this kind of take-out or was it a restaurant as well?\n\nViazzi:  It was eat in and take out.  Yes.  It was the site of the old Ottomanelli butcher shop there on Bleecker, a long, a deep restaurant, bigger than the trattoria.  I think it may have seated fifty or sixty people, maybe fifty.  But it was equally successful for people to sit down.  I remember meeting Robert Duvall, that wonderful actor, there, who was filming somewhere nearby and came in all by his little self to have a late lunch.\n\nQ:  And he kept all of these going at the same time.\n\nViazzi:  All of them going at the same time.  But he then, piano, piano, he sold—well, he really gave it, but like rented it, sub-rented, sub-leased, to his daughter.  His youngest daughter and her husband ran the Caffe da Alfredo, and then his adopted son by his first wife was the manager of the Tavola Calda.  So, in other words, the literal operations of everything were not still his.  Then he opened Alfredo’s Settebello, which was 10th Street on Seventh Avenue.\n\nQ:  When would that have been?\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  On the site of an old ricky-ticky place called Your Father’s Mustache.  It was a jazz place, I think.\n\nQ:  So this would have been in ’70-what?\n\nViazzi:  This would be—well, now we’re getting in—oh, no, wait.  It was ’77, because it was at that time that he had his first heart attack, and his second, which killed him, was ten years later.  So that’s how I date that.  Now, was that the end of it?\n\nQ:  Let me ask you, though, with these different restaurants, was he trying to, I don’t know, enlarge the envelope, or was he trying to do something different with each place or just have a little mini empire?\n\nViazzi:  Well, I think it was a kind of megalomania, frankly.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  I see, of course.  Why didn’t I think of that?\n\nViazzi:  You know.  I remember a Texan millionaire friend of ours who said, “Alfredo, why don’t you name one of these restaurants the Trattoria da Jane?”  [laughter]  Well, Alfredo would never.  It would never occur to him.  Everything was da Alfredo.  But they were variations on the theme, because Caffe da Alfredo was based on an outdoor café, and it was the first time, to my knowledge, that there were tables with little umbrellas in them under—you know, indoors.\n\nQ:  Oh.\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  I even built a little fountain in the corner.  I’m very handy, so I laid stones.  There was this little angular corner, and we bought a statue.  A Florentine craftsman was still in existence.  And it spouted water into a little receptacle.  It was like, you know, indoors, yes.  Then Tavola Calda was yet another offshoot of the same.  The food was all the same, essentially, except that the Caffe was featuring sandwiches, wonderful creative sandwiches with avocado and asparagus and prosciutto, you know, things that only now—\n\nQ:  That was early.\n\nViazzi:  It was early for those kinds of very—and people have not always been ready for it.  But Caffe turned out to be very successful, but each of them was kind of a struggle, because people would say, “But can’t I get a hamburger?”  I mean, people are so stupid, really, and so, so retarded.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  The service business, it’s a problem.\n\nViazzi:  Oh, you’d better believe it.  So he would have to nudge them forward, but he used to love creating.  Yet he’d say to me, “How about shrimp,” and, you know, he’d go on and on.\nAnd I’d say, “Oh, god, oh, yes, make it, make it, quickly, quickly.”\n\tThen the Alfredo’s Settebello was yet another variation on the theme because it was a cabaret with live entertainment, marvelous, marvelous entertainers there.  He even had a snake handler with a fifteen-foot cobra.  Did I say cobra?  No.  Python.  Yes.  I mean, the staff said, “My god.”  But, no, that’s what he wanted in entertainment, and it was this strange combination of very good food and very interesting and good cabaret, and I think, there, too, it was ahead of its time.\n\nQ:  And were people interested in food coming to all of these restaurants?\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  But I think the mistake he made was that combination of cabaret and food, because people came and wanted to dine and dine and dine and dine, you know, at ten o’clock or whenever, nine o’clock, that would be the end of the dining and the cabaret would start.  So there would be kind of an influx and an efflux.\n\nQ:  A supper club kind of thing?\n\nViazzi:  Yes, right, but really more European cabaret than supper club.\n\nQ:  Were the restaurants reviewed?\n\nViazzi:  They were all reviewed.  Settebello was the least well reviewed, because it was so enterprising that they came prematurely, and it was that situation that so many really good restaurants have, where the chief critic shows up on Tuesday instead of properly next Thursday.  So they said, essentially, that this combination was awkward and didn’t quite— \n\nQ:  Do you remember if James Beard came to all of them, just one of them?\n\nViazzi:  He did.  He came to absolutely all of them.  I remember him in the Settebello because under Alfredo’s nudge, I inaugurated a club act, and it was very successful.  I had the most beautiful gown on, and I had Stan Freeman as my accompanist.  He was my first ever accompanist, the great Stan Freeman.  Oh, how I loved that man.  We flew together.  But I remember James Beard sitting there, big as a mountain.  He was always in attendance.  He really cared for us and we cared for him.\n\nQ:  He must have liked the food as well, though.\n\nViazzi:  Yes, I think so.  I think so.\n\tWe met out in California.  We were all staying on different floors at the Stanford Court, which was one of his places, Jim Beard’s.  I think he had been contributory to it in some way.  I remember—well, I don’t know if we want to print this.  Well, you’re not printing this.  Well, I don’t know what you’re doing with this.  I’m just blabbing.  But Alfredo picked up the phone.  It was Jim on floor sixteen, and we were on twelve, or whatever.  Jim had gone to the bathroom and had lowered his drawers, and then he couldn’t get them back up.\n\nQ:  Oh, dear.\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  So he asked if Alfredo would come up and pull up his drawers.\n\nQ:  Oh, lord.\n\nViazzi:  And that was just so, you know—it struck both of our hearts, poor thing.\n\nQ:  Now, Alfredo, obviously, died very, very much too soon.\n\nViazzi:  Oh, yes.  December 28, 1987, so he was sixty-six.\n\nQ:  And, meanwhile, you had all these restaurants to think about.\n\nViazzi:  Well, the Caffe had been closed by that time, and I think maybe—well, certainly, Settebello was gone, because that only lasted less than a year, I think.  I know that I only had the trattoria to deal with and, as I told you last time, because the roof fell in in the original Bank and Hudson location, we had—oh, that was the other.  That was the fourth restaurant, was Caffe Domel.\n\nQ:  Oh, Caffe Domel?\n\nViazzi:  Yes.  Domel, D-o-m-e-l.  Not Domel because of that ferocious owner and not Dumel although that’s nicer, even.\n\nQ:  Domel, and the O is capitalized?\n\nViazzi:  No.  Capital D-o-m-e-l.  So trattoria now was housed where Caffe Domel had been, and that’s the one I closed.\n\nQ:  And how soon did you close that?\n\nViazzi:  Oh, virtually straight away.  He was in hospital for maybe ten days, and he was in intensive care, and then they were going to move him the very next day, and he died.  So in that interim period that I was running the restaurant, and what a terrible job that is.  It’s far worse than the theater, but they are so alike.  They’re so kind of on the spur-of-the-moment decisions and changes of direction.\n\tBut I was concerned about, not only, of course, about him, but about the restaurant, because we had a kind of pushy maître, funny guy, used to laugh with him a lot.  He was honest, but he had his own ideas about what the restaurant should be.  Devoted though he was to Alfredo, it was just a difference in background, heritage, exposure, all those things.\n\tI remember Alfredo and I having gone to the theater or to somebody’s house, and we came by the original trattoria in a cab, and we looked as if, but is it open?  It was so dim there.  Alfredo always had that Italian trattoria look of the place, with the lights up rather high, not terribly attractive, but very Italian, you know.  Chuck, on the other hand, had them down, you know, to this gay level where you can hardly see the food, which was never Alfredo’s belief.  He thought you should see the food and you should see each other.  So he had to pull Chuck up short on that.  He said, “I don’t want the lights down like that.”  And Chuck would give some kind of feeble—so the upshot is that when Alfredo died, I thought I cannot run that restaurant.  I can’t go in and say, “Yes, that sauce is perfect.”  It has to be run by Alfredo, basta, or else I’m going to go in there for dinner and it will be a Chinese-flavored evening, you know.\n\nQ:  Fusion, yes.\n\nViazzi:  So all their little faces fell, I know, but they knew it was in the wind, because he had been ill for, you know, a certain amount of time, so they had been without him, and I think it probably had already begun to stray.  He was a very tough taskmaster, like Joe Baum, like any professional.\n\nQ:  Did you stay in touch with any of these people or any people from the food world after you closed the restaurant?\n\nViazzi:  Well, Jim had died.  Jim died in, what, ’85, ’84 or ’85, and he died at the same hospital as Alfredo, St. Vincent’s.\n\nQ:  Did you go to any of the funeral?\n\nViazzi:  Oh, yes.  Alfredo was very deeply hurt by his passing, well, like all of us in the food business or out.  I did stay and got to be very close friends with the Baums.  They adopted this poor widow lady, and we really honored each other and admired each other a lot.  And we went to his funeral, and I still have the book of the ceremony for Joe.  I think it was at Town Hall.  It was a big, you know, turnout.\nI had an honoring eve, afternoon, for Alfredo at the Church of St. Luke in the Fields down here, and James Levine spoke and Joe Baum spoke.  Joe Baum quoted from a letter that had been sent me by Milton Glaser.  Joe Masteroff, who was the writer of She Loves Me and Cabaret, was a close friend of mine at the time.  He was in attendance.  Earle Hyman was there.  Carrie Nye was there.  Tatiana Troyanos was there.  Mrs. Roy Wilkins turned up out of the blue; hadn’t seen her since I was a child.  It was a lovely—and I had a jazz band, and they played for people coming in and taking their seats, “Don’t Mean a Thing if You Ain’t Got That Swing,” because that really bespoke Alfredo.\n\nQ:  It must have been enormously difficult for you to reorganize your life after that.\n\nViazzi:  It was, yes.\n\nQ:  Not to mention that you had to learn how to cook.\n\nViazzi:  Yes, right.  Well, I had to fend for me self, didn’t I?  Can make my own liver, bacon, and onions, and nobody would sneer.  [laughter]\n\tBut you know, I had friends, both of whom now who have since died, but the producer in the theater, Alexander Cohen, and his wife, Hildy Cohen, Hildy and I dated way, way back in the theater together, and they invited me to Mougins, where they had a divine adapted farmhouse.  And one night Hildy suggested to me in rather strong terms that perhaps it was time for me to cook a meal.  [laughs]  So we moseyed into town, and I said, “Do you like couscous?”\n\tAnd she said, “Oh, yes, and Alex loves it, too.”  So I undertook to make a couscous with—\n\nQ:  In Mougins.  In France?\n\nViazzi:  Well, with a fruit, you know, a marvelous rich fruit covering.  I know that the ghost of Alfredo was there with me, because I had never done such a thing, but I seemed to know exactly what to do.  But Hildy wandered past and said, “Can you use this apple?”\n\tI said, “Yes, I can,” I mean, which was the style of Alfredo.  Said, “Oh, really, well, throw that in.”  Because he knew what went with what, which I think is your basic knowledge to be a cook.  I have since learned that.  But that, it was like something out of, you know, a science fiction movie with the hand of Alfredo was saying, “Throw that in.  Stir up those onions and now add a little broth to that,” which he used to pronounced “brot.”  “Has that got some brot in it?”\n\tI made this.  It was enormously successful.  They were smacking their lips, and I thought, “I don’t believe I did that.”  So that was kind of a turnaround, but that was like 1988.  No, it was longer than that.  It took me like three or four years to decide I was going to go there and brave the European continent.\n\nQ:  Once again.\n\nViazzi:  Once again, yes.  I don’t know what I thought it was going to do to me if I went there prematurely.  I’d just come apart.  But I said, “Yes, I’ll come over.”\n\tAnd I went in the—I think it may have been the summer of, I think it may have been, ’91, ’90 or ’91, and here was this epiphany.  And then so after that, I was free.  Now I’m extremely experimental and I’m quite good.\n\nQ:  You cook now.\n\nViazzi:  I do cook and I like to have friends.  I can only have two friends because then I have to bring in one chair from the bedroom.\n\nQ:  I know the feeling, yes.\n\nViazzi:  It’s just two friends and me.  But I see it used to turn him on so much, but I gather that’s true of all restaurateurs.\n\nQ:  Wait.  What used to turn him on?\n\nViazzi:  The cooking.  Cooking is a great turn-on.\n\nQ:  Yes.  Yes.\n\nViazzi:  That tasting and that stirring and seeing the nature of it change, seeing browning, it’s just—but, yes, I don’t do it all the time because it’s just too fatiguing.  We used to have Jim Beard’s most beloved store over there, Jefferson Market, which closed and now is a Gristedes.\n\nQ:  Yes, I’ve been in there.  It is dispiriting.\n\nViazzi:  Oh, isn’t it awful?\n\nQ:  It is, yes.\n\nViazzi:  And forget the instant food department.  They used to have the best Tavolo calda in the world.  All of us old pensioners used to go there and get the most—they had the lovely little roast chickens that were so savory.  Oh, I just hate them now so much.\n\nQ:  Yes.  I was in there recently, and it was very sad.  They seem to continue to have one of the butchers there, very lonely in back.\n\nViazzi:  Oh, really?  Do they?  It’s true that Jefferson Market turned out to be a really sad operation where sometimes you wouldn’t even bother to go in because you knew they didn’t have it.  But the hot food counter was to die, it was so good, everything was so savory.\n\nQ:  Jane, I wish I could stay and talk to you about the rest of your life, but, unfortunately, the project doesn’t have enough money for that.  [laughs]\n\nViazzi:  Well, also, it’s five of five, do you believe that?\n\nQ:  I do.  But thank you so much for this conversation.\n\nViazzi:  Oh, honey.\n\nQ:  And for introducing me to these books.\n\nViazzi:  Darling, I enjoyed—\n\nQ:  And I will be back with your transcript.\n\nViazzi:  I probably won’t even look at it, because I get embarrassed by myself.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViazzi – 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n","description":"An actress and cabaret performer in the late 1940s and 1950s, Jane White Viazzi was married to Alfredo Viazzi, owner of several Greenwich Village restaurants that featured Italian regional cooking before it was fashionable.

Upscale versions are currently very fashionable in New York City. We take them for granted.\r\n\r\nBut food courts run by a single operator didn't exist until the 1970s, when restaurant consultants Joe Baum and Michael Whiteman created The Big Kitchen, a 350-seat complex on the concourse level of the World Trade Center.\r\n\r\nBaum, who was the president of Restaurant Associates (RA) for many years, was a life force in the restaurant industry, a man full of innovative methods of preparing and serving food at places like The Four Seasons, The Forum of the Twelve Caesars, and Fonda del Sol. In 1970, Baum left RA to form his own consulting company. In that same year, he landed a big contract to create the master plan for restaurants in the World Trade Center, and he needed help.\r\n\r\nHis choice was the much younger Whiteman, then the Editor of Nation's Restaurant News, a biweekly trade magazine he had created. Eventually the two set up \"Baum + Whiteman - The World's Preeiminent Food + Restaurant Consulting Company.\" After Baum's death in 1998, Whiteman and his wife, chef and cookbook author Rozanne Gold, carried on the business with Dennis Sweeney.\r\n\r\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Michael Whiteman\t\t\t\t\t\t   Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\tNew York, New York\n\nDate:  September 21, 2009\n\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It’s September 21, 2009, and I’m with Michael Whiteman in his home in Park Slope.\n\tGood afternoon.\n\nWhiteman:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we start this with your telling me something about your childhood, when and where you were born, and what influences on you growing up.\n\nWhiteman:  I was born in Brooklyn in 1938, in Flatbush, which is the other side of Prospect Park from where we’re now sitting.  I went to elementary school and junior high school and high school in that neighborhood in the days when you were allowed to walk to school rather than being bused.\n\tMy parents both worked.  My mother, therefore, was an early pioneer of working women.  She also fancied herself to be a very good cook.  There’s a funny story that says I always thought my mother was the best cook in the world until I joined the army.\n\nQ:  That is funny.  [laughs]\n\nWhiteman:  But she was better than that, and she was fairly adventurous, so I remember having things like lamb curry before it became fashionable at dinner parties.  She was, at the time, also famous for her Hawaiian meatballs, which is a dish that’s no longer made, and with very good reason.\n\nQ:  There was pineapple, undoubtedly?\n\nWhiteman:  With the pineapple and the green peppers and the cornstarch.\n\tNobody in the house drank wine, but my father drank very good scotch, and at an early age he allowed me to have some, and I kept on drinking scotch through my teenage years and into my twenties until I discovered that that’s the reason that I was getting hangovers in the morning.  So without knowing why, I just immediately got up one morning and switched to bourbon, and have been a very good bourbon drinker ever since.\n\nQ:  Actually, one of the things that was nice about living in Washington was that bourbon was quite an acceptable thing to drink, it being sort of the South.\n\nWhiteman:  We were giving at the World Trade Center one day a dinner for a whole bunch of foodies who had proceeded to drink everything we could possibly feed them, and they ate a lot.  After dinner, I put brandy glasses on the table and poured little splashes of 100-proof Old Fitzgerald, which I think is no longer made, into each glass, and everybody then began to give their opinion as to what it was they were drinking.  Oh, you heard these rare forms of Armagnac and cognacs and rare brandies from here and there and everything.  So when I finally told them what they were drinking, they got very upset.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  What was education after school in Brooklyn?\n\nWhiteman:  I went to Syracuse University, where I was majoring in engineering, which I discovered I hated.  So without leaving the engineering school, I just stopped taking engineering courses for a couple of years and took English and journalism courses until they caught up with me, when they realized I was taking more credits than was allowed in the liberal arts school because the journalism school took six more credits than liberal arts did.  But I graduated with a degree in English and was working as a journalist for a company that published a string of retail trade magazines.  That was in 1963.\n\nQ:  How did you find them?\n\nWhiteman:  I answered an ad, and it was in those days that you took batteries of tests in order to get employed, and they discovered that I was fit for nothing in the way of a job that they had open, but somebody high up in the organization realized I was probably a useful misfit, and so he hired me.\n\tI went to work on a trade magazine that dealt with what was then a dying breed, but I didn’t know it.  It was something that went to the variety stores, Woolworth’s, Kresge, W.T. Grant, all those kinds of former names.  But the fellow had hired me because he had a feeling that I could probably do things that were out of the ordinary.  So when the editor of On the Drugstore magazine got into trouble, they moved me over there for a while, and then they were starting a discount store newspaper.\n\nQ:  I didn’t know about these.  That’s interesting.\n\nWhiteman:  So I worked on the pilot edition of that for some time.  Somewhere along the way in between there I got drafted, so I was in the army from—my dates are wrong.  I was in the army from 1961 to ’63, so I started working for them, say, in 1960.  When I got out, I went back to them and worked on these other publications.  In 1967, I guess it was, they asked if I would start a restaurant business newspaper because they sensed that the restaurant industry, which at that point was mostly a mom-and-pop business, was emerging as a national chain business.\n\nQ:  That’s fascinating.  That, you said, was ’67?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Interesting.  So what was the scope of what you started?\n\nWhiteman:  It was a tabloid biweekly paper.  It’s now a weekly.  It still exists and is the dominant publication in its field.  It was a paid publication in a field where everything else was given away.\n\nQ:  People had to subscribe to it?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  It had an ABC audit, which is highly unusual in the trade magazine business.  And it became profitable within a year.  It some kind of world’s record.\n\nQ:  This was Nation’s Restaurant News?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  It’s still in the same format.  The only thing that’s changed is that it’s now every week.  It and the industry grew together.  When I started it, even McDonald’s was not a national chain; it was a group of regional chains.  I guess the only thing that was really national was Howard Johnson, because they had somebody who had a franchise in California.  But the industry grew very rapidly, and the newspaper grew very rapidly.\n\tIt was while I was doing that that I was introduced to Joe Baum.  Joe had been the creative force behind Restaurant Associates.\n\nQ:  When did Restaurant Associates start?  I don’t know.\n\nWhiteman:  Restaurant Associates, you’d have to go back in history, but Restaurant Associates started in the fifties, in probably the late fifties.  Joe had worked at the Newarker and had been in on the original process of the development of the Four Seasons and the Forum [of the Twelve Caesars], and then he did Charlie O’s and Charlie Brown’s and La Fonda del Sol.  So Joe was fundamentally the father of the theme restaurant, which is something he hated to be called.  But it’s all his fault.  [laughs]  He lost the boardroom battle in 1967 at Restaurant Associates and—\n\nQ:  Oh, that’s interesting.\n\nWhiteman:  —and had gotten a contract with the Port Authority of New York to create the master plan for restaurants in the then-under-construction World Trade Center.  As part of his contract, he needed a consultant to work with him, and although I knew absolutely nothing about the restaurant business in terms of it being an operational business, I had been writing a lot and traveling a lot.  I spent half my time traveling across the country.\n\nQ:  So you were the editor of Nation’s Restaurant News.\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So in that capacity, you were traveling to see what was going on?\n\nWhiteman:  Correct.  So I jumped ship.  I figured I could always be a journalist if need be.  [laughter]  Of course, that was 1967.  That was 1971.  So I began working with Joe on the World Trade Center in 1971, which was just beginning to come out of the ground.  The first thing that the Port Authority needed was a temporary restaurant to feed the people who were building it, and the porters and people like that who were cleaning up after the people who were building it, and the early tenants, because the building was obviously being built from the bottom up, but as the lower floors became available, people were moving in.  So there was an office constituency and a kind of construction constituency.  We built a self-service restaurant out of construction materials, corrugated metal and construction lamps and pipe scaffolding, and it was meant to last for three years.  It was meant to last about three years.  I think it lasted about twenty.  It was extremely successful.\n\nQ:  Did the two of you work out the concept together or what?\n\nWhiteman:  We worked on the concept together, and he decided I should learn something about the restaurant industry, so I also became its manager.  So I managed the place during the day, which was down at the World Trade Center, and we had our offices in the Port Authority headquarters, which were on 8th Avenue and 15th Street.  So I would shuttle back and forth between conceptual meetings and design meetings and putting out fires in this restaurant.\n\tThere were a whole set of amazing contrasts, because here I was running a restaurant that was filled largely in the evening by drunken construction workers, and during the day by people in business suits, and so by day I was laboring in the basement and having meetings in the evening about how to help create Windows on the World on the top of the building.  [laughs]\n\tThe Port Authority had given Joe this contract with one very specific requirement, and that is that they wanted a club on top of one of the towers.  The history of clubs in the United States, right through to this day, is that they lose money, especially when they’re clubs in office buildings.  So Joe applied a formula that he had worked on once before on top of the Time-Life Building where there was a club as well during lunch, that became a public restaurant in the evening, and applied that principle to Windows on the World.  So it was a club during the day and a restaurant in the evening.\n\tWhat was really revolutionary—I use that word advisedly.  What was really revolutionary about Windows is that when people were developing clubs around the country, especially in office buildings, they made them look like clubs, you know, the trappings of full masculinity and leather chairs and fireplaces and oriental carpets and beamed ceilings and all that stuff.\n\nQ:  It looked quiet.\n\nWhiteman:  Windows turned the whole thing on its head, with the idea that we would design the greatest evening restaurant that we possibly could and make it as famous as we possibly could so that people would kill to join the club, rather than having people join a club that you then strained into trying to make an unsuccessful public restaurant.\n\nQ:  So the concept was as a club initially?\n\nWhiteman:  No, the concept was to do a great restaurant that served as a club during the day.\nAt the time, New York was in real trouble.  The West Side Highway had broken, literally had collapsed right in front of the World Trade Center.  Wall Street was in its worst shape since the depression.  Sounds familiar.  No one lived downtown.  It was an absolute wasteland in the evening, and the city itself was on the verge of bankruptcy, was bankrupt.  So there were numerous editorials and attacks on what we were doing on top of the World Trade Center, because we were building this two-story extravaganza.  It was on the 106th and 107th floor of 1 World Trade Center, and we were squandering public money on this folly that the Port Authority had because they wanted to build this icon up in the—\n\nQ:  Was it all private money that—\n\nWhiteman:  This is Port Authority money.\n\nQ:  I mean public money.  But Port Authority money is public money.  Was there any private money as well?\n\nWhiteman:  No, it was public money.  And they quoted George Lang, who was a competitive consultant at the time, in one of their articles [unclear] against what we were doing at the World Trade Center, saying, of course, the city was bankrupt, no one would go down there, etc., etc., etc.  Well, in 1976, we opened and it was an enormous success, and it was an enormous success for a lot of reasons.  Number one was, I think, everybody wanted it to be a success because the city couldn’t tolerate another public failure.  It was the original Up Sail so the Port and all the waterfront which we were facing was suddenly very active and a lot of filming was done from up there of Up Sail, so we had national exposure.  And it was this grand, grand restaurant in the sky where the food was so good that nobody equated it with other rooftop restaurants where you only went up for the view and you tolerated what was put on your plate.\n\nQ:  You had a lot of culinary consultants, as I recall.\n\nWhiteman:  We had Jacques Pépin, who was organizing a commissary for us down in the bowels of the building.  We had Albert Kumin, who was the great pastry chef, formerly of the Four Seasons, who then left us to become pastry chef at the White House.  We had Barbara Kafka, who worked brilliantly on menus, and James Beard, who worked with us on not just menus, but philosophy of food.  Jim was really quite wonderful.  The stories, they could go on forever.\n\nQ:  Tell me what it was like to work with Jim Beard.\n\nWhiteman:  Jim could be difficult until he wasn’t.  You could ask Jim the wrong questions for half a day and get nothing back.  When you pressed the right button, he suddenly became a fountain.\n\nQ:  Did you learn what the right buttons were?\n\nWhiteman:  No, you never really knew.  You never really knew.  But the broader the question you asked him, the better.  Sometimes he would just sit and talk, and sometimes he would produce these long memos on legal pads that were bigger than that, and long just stream-of-consciousness writing.  I’m not sure I have any of them any longer.  I did once.  They may have come down in the World Trade Center.\n\nQ:  So these meetings would take place with you and Joe and Jim Beard and with other people as well?\n\nWhiteman:  No, Joe never had a meeting with two or three people.  It was as many people as he could put into a room would come to a meeting.  Joe would put together a lot of people who were not particularly qualified to do what was asked of them, but if you put enough of them into the room, some brilliance would emerge, and that was his technique.\n\tSo there would very often be a meeting of Joe and Jim and Barbara and very often Milton Glaser, who didn’t really know that much about food, but had a lot to say and a lot of insight, and there was somebody who was thinking in three dimensions in a room where everybody was thinking about something on a plate.  So we were dealing with all of the senses.  It was a remarkable brain trust of people.  You would occasionally have an advertising genius sitting in on a food conference.\n\nQ:  The food part of this brain trust, did these people get along with each other?\n\nWhiteman:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Not in the sense that everybody was unanimous.  If there was disagreement, it wasn’t friction; it was disagreement of a lot of brilliant people.\nJim, of course, brought an enormous sense of history.  I remember once Joe asked a question about lamb stew, which is something that nobody would serve today, and we got a memo back from Jim.  It must have been eight pages about lamb stew.  I am paraphrasing, but I’m pretty close to the language.  He said something like, “We have to have a lamb stew, all buttery and creamy and so voluptuous that you want to cuddle it in your arms.”  Now, that’s not a recipe, and if you call the chef in and say, “Jim wants lamb stew that you can cuddle,” you’d better have a patient chef, because you would then go through a dozen iterations of lamb stew until everybody said, “Oh, I can cuddle that.”  But that’s how the food was developed.\n\nQ:  Over how long a period of time was that?\n\nWhiteman:  A couple of years.  We did a restaurant in—let me backtrack.  Windows on the World was the most famous restaurant of everything we did in the World Trade Center.  Number one, it was highly innovative, and I can give you chapter and verse on that later.  In addition to that, it had all that visibility.  The best restaurant that we had in the World Trade Center was also down in the basement.  It was called the Market Bar and Dining Rooms, and it was a three-star restaurant, from the New York Times.  Windows never got more than one or two.  It was a three-star restaurant in the basement of the World Trade Center.  It had no signage.  It had no entrance.  Our busiest nights of the week were Friday night and Saturday night when there was no one whatsoever in Lower Manhattan.  People were coming to it.  It was a restaurant that was largely beefy, hence the name.  It was on the site of the old Washington markets, so that was the derivation of the Market Bar and Dining Room.\n\tJoe came to me one day and said, “Vegetables.”  I’d been laboring on this beefy menu.  Joe came, just stuck his head in my door and said, “Vegetables.”  So I produced a laundry list of kinds of vegetables that could be served, and he looked at it and he said, “No, that’s not what I mean.”\n\nQ:  Had you produced the equivalent of sides or what?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, I didn’t really know what he wanted.  He didn’t know what he wanted.  So I did another list, and that didn’t get us anywhere.  So I said to Jim at a meeting about something else, I said, “Joe keeps talking to me about vegetables, and I don’t know what he wants.”\n\tSo Jim looked at the lists and he said, “Why don’t you put a whole head of cauliflower on a tray with a carving knife and a fork and just set it on the table.”\n\nQ:  Cooked or not?\n\nWhiteman:  Cooked.  He said, “Maybe that’s what Joe means.”  So we did, and Joe looked at it and said, “Oh, that’s a start.”  [laughter]  Never satisfied.  He didn’t know where this was going to go, but he was never satisfied.\n\tSo, eventually, we ended up with not a plate, but a platter, a big platter, that would either have a whole head of cauliflower or a giant mound of broccoli in the center, and there might be six other vegetable preparations around it.  We sold it as a vegetable platter for the table, and it became the top seller in the restaurant, in this beef-oriented restaurant.\n\nQ:  That’s really interesting.\n\nWhiteman:  We had a vegetable sommelier.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nWhiteman:  That was his title.  We had a vegetable sommelier.  His job was to walk around and tell everybody—sometimes he’d have a basketful of vegetables, walk around and tell the guests what we had in the way of vegetables and what we were preparing that night, and how we could do this or that, and how it might appear on this whole vegetable platter.  And it worked.\n\nQ:  And where do these vegetables come from, from the market or—not from farmers at that point.\n\nWhiteman:  No.  Actually, Joe did buy from farmers but not then.  He bought from farmers before that for the Four Seasons.\n\nQ:  Oh, of course.  That makes sense, yes.\n\nWhiteman:  But we did have an interesting menu.  The Market Bar and Dining Room’s menu had a series of boxes, maybe fifteen or twenty boxes, down the center of the menu, with the names of the suppliers from whom we were buying.  So there were two or three meat people, two or three fish people, a couple of vegetable people, and the boxes with their names.  And the day’s specials were written in the boxes from whom we bought the product.\n\nQ:  That was way ahead of the fashion for it.\n\nWhiteman:  This was in 1976.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Wow.  What happened to that restaurant?\n\nWhiteman:  I think it was after the first bombing in 1993, the Port Authority did a big renovation on that level.  I think it became a Port Authority security command post.  They made a whole bunch of other changes on that floor.\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, let me get this clear, though.  You were working for and with Joe, right?\n\nWhiteman:  Correct.\n\nQ:  On other projects at the same time?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.\n\nQ:  You were very young and he was not, and that makes an interesting relationship.  How did that work?\n\nWhiteman:  I would have been—\n\nQ:  Considerably younger than he.\n\nWhiteman:  I was in my thirties.  I was in my mid-thirties, and he would have been, I think, fifteen years older than I am, so he would have been in his fifties or thereabouts.  He was always fifteen years older than I was.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Right.  And how did you work together?  Did you have, I don’t know, specific areas you were responsible for?\n\nWhiteman:  No, there were no lines of authority working for Joe, and you never knew what you were going to be doing next or with whom.  But since Joe was a consultant and I was a consultant with Joe, Joe had a clause in his contract that said the majority of his time had to be given to the Port Authority, so we didn’t do a lot of consulting work, but it was fairly high profile.  We did the master plan for an expansion for the National Gallery of Art in Washington when I.M. Pei put his building up there.\n\nQ:  You mean for the basement cafeteria?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes, but not just the cafeteria.  There were other places in that building to eat.  There was a Scholar’s Lounge and there was an Executive Dining Room and I forget what else.\n\nQ:  There were lovely places to eat in that building.\n\nWhiteman:  So we did that.  We did an insurance company’s headquarters, and we did a seven- or nine-story Food Center in Hiroshima.\n\nQ:  Wow.  And you were known as restaurant consultants?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  And we did a couple of food courts for shopping center developers who came to see what we were doing.\n\nQ:  Tell me about the food courts and the first food court and how all that came about.\n\nWhiteman:  There was one food court, sort of, which was opened around that time, which was at the Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston, which opened while we were working on ours.  Ours was the first that was run by a single operator.  The one in Faneuil Hall was parceled out to a lot of individual tenants.\n\nQ:  So when was yours?\n\nWhiteman:  Ours opened in ’76.  It was interesting in a couple of ways.  Number one, it was run by one company.  Number two, we knew that when evening came, there would not be much of a population in the building, so we were not going to get a lot of business then.  But we were occupying a prime piece of real estate, and it was Joe’s idea for some of the elements of this food court to become retail shops in the evening.  So if we weren’t selling ham and cheese sandwiches in the evening, we had a small gourmet shop that sold a variety of cheeses and charcuterie and salads for people to take home.\n\nQ:  So what did that actually look like?  Was it, I don’t know, a circle, a square?\n\nWhiteman:  It was a big, big complex.  It had about 350 seats.  It had a deli that became a gourmet shop in the evening.  It had a bakery that sold things in dough for lunch, like a quiche or pot pie or—I don’t remember.  But it also sold cakes and pies that we made at the Trade Center, and hundreds and hundreds of dozens of loaves of bread that we had developed for us and we sold them at retail for people going home.  We had a coffee, tea, soup kiosk.  This is long before the advent of the coffee store.  It sold a variety of coffees and pastries during breakfast.  It sold soup for lunch.  It sold coffees by the pound and teas by the ounce and coffeemakers to take home in the evening.  We had a rotisserie that served ribs and chicken by the plate during lunch, and by the pound to take home in the evening.  It was interesting.\n\nQ:  What was this called?\n\nWhiteman:  It was called The Big Kitchen.\n\nQ:  Did people get their food by going to these individual, as it were, stations?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  And unlike what you see in a typical shopping center today, where all these stands are lined up shoulder to shoulder and they just look like one continuous slot in the wall with little paper dividers between them, the stations were really quite separate, and you ate in amidst them, so you felt as if you were in a market kind of environment.\n\nQ:  How was that written about?  Was it reviewed?\n\nWhiteman:  Oh yes.  It got international press, and it’s that that won the—I think it was the Bard Award for Urban Design.  Milton Glaser had designed not so much a sign as there were a bunch of freestanding three-dimensional letters that read out “The Big Kitchen,” and the letters were about seven feet high and about two feet thick, and the backs of some of the letters became merchandising for some of the retail stands.\n\nQ:  Oh, that is very smart.  I guess what I’m getting at, was it reviewed in terms of the food, in terms of the urban concept.\n\nWhiteman:  Both.  It got a very good review, and I think it maybe got the longest review the New York Times had ever written.  And the thing gave the Port Authority fits, the sign did, because I remember the letter G.\n\nQ:  What was it advertising on the back?\n\nWhiteman:  People would ease their fanny into the lower portion of the letter of G and sit there and read the Times, and kids would climb up and leap from letter to letter to letter, which drove the insurance people batty.  People who were courting would hide behind the letters.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Was it perceived of as a new concept?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  I may, in my files downstairs, have a review of it.  So it was really quite something, and it was very successful.  We didn’t know how to run it, so we had to learn as we were doing it.  It was a real bitch, but it was great.  We must have done four or five other food courts.\n\nQ:  People came to you to ask—?\n\nWhiteman:  People came to us.  We did the first fast food court in Japan in Hiroshima.\n\nQ:  When was that?\n\nWhiteman:  In 1977 or ‘78.  We did the first food court in continental Europe in Brussels around the same time, maybe 1980, and those were both urban food courts.  Then we did four or five suburban food courts, which are the typical ones you see today.  So we apologize for that.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Well, I don’t know.  They’re very helpful, actually.\n\nWhiteman:  Well, you see, at the time, shopping centers were developed with food scattered about the shopping center, which made a fair amount of sense because it would interrupt your movement through the shopping center and you would stop and have something, get up refreshed and ready to shop again.  What the shopping center developers saw in the food court that we did was that it became the quasi anchor, and so it changed the whole thinking about how food and shopping centers related to each other.  So rather than food being merely an amenity that was dispersed throughout the shopping center, it now became a focal point and a destination all its own.\n\nQ:  How big was your company at that point?\n\nWhiteman:  Oh, it was giant.  I mean, there were—\n\nQ:  Did you have architects, did you have—no?\n\nWhiteman:  No, we had nothing.  We were three.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Oh, I see.  Oh, my goodness.  Really giant.\n\nWhiteman:  Were we ever more than three?  We may have been four at one time, but we never got larger than that.\n\nQ:  So you would hire people as you needed them?\n\nWhiteman:  Barbara was a consultant.  Jim was a consultant.  Milton Glaser would have been a consultant.  When we got everything opened and running at the World Trade Center, we went from a company of four to, I don’t know, a company of about nine hundred, but the consulting company was never really more than four.  It was an operating company which had the nine hundred people.  Same bosses.\n\nQ:  That’s all really interesting.  Who decided what kinds of projects to take on?  Did you do that together?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, we were very arrogant.  Because of the high visibility of what we had done and the publicity that it got all around the world, we spent the first year and a half without stationery or business cards.  The phone would just ring.  And I used to publish non-client list.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  What was that?\n\nWhiteman:  That’s what we called it because we had this long list of people that wanted us to work for them, we would just scratch out the people we weren’t interested in, which is no longer true.  So we were very fortunate to have a whole roster of very interesting projects.  After we did the National Gallery in Washington, we worked on a master plan for the Metropolitan Museum.  We worked on the master plan for the Getty Museum in California.  Of course, we got some other high-profile top-of-roof restaurants, one of which was the Rainbow Room.\n\nQ:  When was the Rainbow Room?\n\nWhiteman:  We reopened the Rainbow Room in 1987, so I guess we started working on it in 1985, and that started as a consulting project.  The Rockefellers came to us and asked us to consider re-planning the entire top of what was then the RCA Building.  It was an interesting confluence of times, because they had huge amount of office leases coming due around then, and office rents had gone—I’m making up numbers, but I’m not far wrong—had gone from five dollars a square foot when they were signed, to about fifty dollars or more, and they knew they were going to lose large numbers of people.  They were spending millions and millions of dollars on rehabbing Rockefeller Center, but it was money nobody would ever see.  It was security systems and redone sidewalks and HVAC and all the stuff behind the walls, and they needed something to refocus business and social attention on Rock Center.  It was also around the time that NBC was making noises about moving out, and that’s a giant tenant.  They were over a million square feet themselves.\n\tIt was just coincidental that the lease with the then current operator of the Rainbow Room was also expiring and was not going to be renewed.  So our assignment was to refocus attention, both business and social attention, on the Rockefeller Center, and the way to do that was to resurrect the Rainbow Room in the same publicly visible manner as we had done with Windows on the World.\n\nQ:  What was the concept for the Rainbow Room?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, you know, you don’t have to do much in the way of a concept for the Rainbow Room.  The Rainbow Room itself was restored, which is a misnomer, but we said it was being restored.  We removed everything from the Rainbow Room, right down to the brick, except for the chandelier that’s in there, which was too big to move, and rebuilt it and made some changes, including how you got into the room itself.  The changes was so minor that you really have to know what was done, but thousands of people came up there and made reservations and said, “Isn’t it wonderful what they’ve done to the Rainbow Room?”  Well, visually, we had done practically nothing to it.  The rest we destroyed and started over again, reshaping rooms and spaces, but the idea was fundamentally a deco-ish design, so you really didn’t have to invent the world.\n\nQ:  In line with the architecture of the building, you mean?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  It was in the bar at the Rainbow Room that we revived all the old cocktails.\n\nQ:  Like what?\n\nWhiteman:  We had a list of about forty old cocktails.  Between The Sheets.  [laughs]  I remember that one.  But they were all genuine cocktails.  Nobody was drinking cocktails at the time.  We brought the martini back, only we weren’t smart enough to know that people would drink anything if you put it in a martini glass, so we just made really good martinis.  [laughs]  But it was a really important bar because it did start the martini craze and the cocktail craze, and the notion of small plates and little meals began there.\n\tRosanne Gold, to whom I’m married, did a fabulous menu called Cocktails and Little Meals, and you got these sharable plates that came on tea stands, three-tiered tea stands, that went along with all these old-fashioned cocktails.\n\nQ:  What year did this happen?\n\nWhiteman:  1987.  We were always ahead of our time.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  When you were doing things like this, when you were working with places like the National Gallery or other public spaces, presumably you had to reshape support systems like the kitchen and that kind of thing, yes?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So how did that work?  Would you bring in architects?\n\nWhiteman:  For reasons I can’t explain, we turned out to be very good at speaking the language of design and architecture and speaking the language of food and menus, although only one of us was a chef, and that’s Rosanne.  Because we were also operators, we understood how to design a kitchen, so we spoke the language of kitchen design.  We never really designed our own kitchens, but we could lay them out, and we could manage, and still do, manage the work of professional kitchen designers.  So we would bring them in as consultants.\n\nQ:  So in places like the National Gallery, was there space that you could reconfigure?  Well, of course, I guess in the I.M. Pei extension, that didn’t exist in the first place.\n\nWhiteman:  No, that was all new space.\n\nQ:  So that was possible.  But in the older parts of the building?\n\nWhiteman:  No, it was all new space, because all of the food work we did was in the new wing.\nIt might be useful to describe how we worked on projects like that.  The World Trade Center and the National Gallery, well, they’re two quite different projects or had some fundamental similarities.  When you’re starting with a blank piece of paper, you have to figure out what to do.  In order to figure out what to do, you have to figure out what you need to know, because these are not just acts of random creativity.\n\tIn the case of the World Trade Center, we commissioned a major survey of dining habits in Lower Manhattan, and when we were all done, we knew how many people had to eat for under three dollars—I’m making up a number because I don’t remember what the prices were back then, but we knew how many people had to eat typically for under three dollars, how many people could eat for as high ten dollars and how many could spend twenty dollars.  So we had some kind of ratio as to the portions of how people spent their money on food.\n\nQ:  This was people in the building or the people in the neighborhood?\n\nWhiteman:  There was no building.  It was all of Lower Manhattan.\n\nQ:  Did Soho exist at that point?\n\nWhiteman:  No, although it was beginning.\n\nQ:  Actually, that’s Tribeca. \n\nWhiteman:  That’s too far north.  There was no Tribeca.  I’m not even sure, I don’t think there was a name Tribeca then.\n\nQ:  Yes.  People weren’t living around there.\n\nWhiteman:  No.  But we had some then idea of proportion of how many people could eat for various price levels.  We knew there were going to be about 50,000 people working in the Trade Center, and we knew they would be something like another 50,000 people passing through the building for one reason or another, especially since we were on top of a major transit hub.  So you work out some number of what the gross demand is.  You figure out how many people are away on sick, vacation, and travel, which is a big number, which everybody forgets.  We found out how many people bring lunch from home.  We found out how many people don’t eat at all.  So you start subtracting from the gross number until you get something we defined ourselves, was our term, called net effective demand.  From that you then begin to say, “Okay, I now have X number of people who need to be fed at three dollars.  How do we do that?  Do we open fifteen coffee shops?  Do we open a giant cafeteria?”  I mean, there’s all that range of choices.  Fast food was not necessarily in the world back then.\n\nQ:  So in the World Trade Center, what did you do?\n\nWhiteman:  The solution to that was The Big Kitchen, which would allow us to serve large numbers of people quickly, with food that they could either eat on the premises or take back to the office, and the people who could spend over twenty dollars went to Window on the World.\n\tBut we segmented the entire group of net-effective-demand people and built places that we thought were sized appropriately to satisfy that demand, and the same thing took place at the National Gallery.  We had a sense of how many visitors they had, how many visitors they were projecting, how many were going to come in bus tours and school groups, how many were going to be like you and me and just coming, how many would be there between the hours of eleven and two, and what percentage of them you reasonably could expect would want to eat.  Then you figure out a form to make that work.  In the case of the National Gallery, it was this big cafeteria with lots of different stations where you didn’t have to wait in a single line.  You could hop and pop around.  So basically it was a food court except that you didn’t pay each station; you paid at the end.\n\nQ:  Was that new?\n\nWhiteman:  We didn’t invent it, but it was a fairly new form at the time.\n\nQ:  It is, by the way, a very favorite place for people to go for lunch when they’re on jury duty in the federal court, and the food there is so horrible, and if you can manage to get across the streets to the National Gallery, it’s a big plus.\n\nWhiteman:  Well, one of the issues that you deal with when you’re working on a museum is whether the food is in a free zone or a paid zone.\n\nQ:  What is the difference?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, if you want to eat the Metropolitan Museum, first you have to pay your entrance fee in order to get to the food.  If you want to eat at the National Gallery, you can get to it for free.  If you want to eat at the Getty, if you can walk up there, which you can’t, you can eat without paying to get in.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Then how would that affect then what kind of food facilities you develop?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, if you can get in without paying, depending on where you’re located, you suddenly begin to expand the demand.  So now you need a facility that’s larger than otherwise would be the case.  So they are all very interesting problems.\n\nQ:  Now, meanwhile, were there other—there must have been, but how many food consultancy businesses, restaurant consultancy businesses began to develop?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, there was George Lang, who—oh, by the way, I never finished the George story.\n\nQ:  Yes, do.\n\nWhiteman:  When we opened in 1976 and Windows was a great success, there was an editorial in the Times or an article in the Times talking about that success, and they quoted George as saying, “Well, of course it’s a success.  Look at the location they had.”  [laughs]  There was George, there was us, and quite honestly, there was nobody else in the country that I know of who was capable of doing that level of work.  There were a lot of kitchen consultants who also did restaurant consulting as part of what they did, but I don’t think there was anybody capable of working on the large complicated projects that we were doing.  Nowadays, by the way, no one needs a restaurant consultant.\n\nQ:  Tell me why.\n\nWhiteman:  When we began, there weren’t any architects and designers that knew how to design restaurants, so we had to teach them, and it was before the days of the star chef and it was before the days when chefs had lots of restaurants.  The famous people in the restaurant business when we started were usually the owners, and they were successful owners because they were in the front of the house of their restaurant all the time.  So there were very few of them who had more than one restaurant.\n\tWhat Joe did, which nobody really understands—you know, they call Joe the father of the theme restaurant because he opened up all these themey places.  What Joe did was to substitute a lot of razzle-dazzle design and a lot of in-your-face food in theme-ing and make it all strong enough so that it would be a substitute for the personality of the owner on the premises.\n\nQ:  Did he do that consciously?\n\nWhiteman:  No.  Just came out that way.  And it was because of that, that he was able to open so many restaurants.  So the heirs of that are people like Danny Meyer and Drew Nieporent and Wolfgang Puck and all the star chefs who you see on television now who became famous not because they owned a lot of restaurants, but because they were famous because they were famous, which allowed them to open a lot of restaurants.  But those are the heirs to the notion that you could replace the personality of the owner or the personality of the chef on the premises with something else.\n\nQ:  When did that take place, if you can give a date?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, Joe started doing that before I began working with him, so it would have been in the fifties.\n\nQ:  How did he create the kind of business that he had?  What did he do before that?\n\nWhiteman:  Joe?\n\nQ:  Yes.  He didn’t just emerge fully formed.\n\nWhiteman:  No.  He grew up in the hotel business.  His family owned a hotel in Saratoga Springs, and he worked in Florida at some of the resort hotels there.  He was hired by the then president of Restaurant Associates to come up and open the Newarker, which was Restaurant Associates’ first theme restaurant.  The Newarker was a grand, flamboyant restaurant at Newark Airport, which was the last place you would ever think anybody would want to go for dinner, but it was the beginning of mass commercial travel and the jet age, and people would go out to the airport just to watch the planes take off and have dinner.\n\nQ:  He brought in food consultants for that as well, didn’t he?\n\nWhiteman:  I don’t know whether anybody worked as a food consultant on that.  I think Jerry Brody, who was the president of Restaurant Associates, and Joe dreamed it up.  I don’t think they had any consultants at the time.  They didn’t exist.\n\nQ:  At what point did Joe’s business begin to describe itself—well, how did it describe itself?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, after he lost his boardroom battle, he became a consultant.\n\nQ:  But what kind?  A restaurant—\n\nWhiteman:  Not a food consultant.  It was a restaurant consultant.  And we still call ourselves food and restaurant consultants, but it’s mostly restaurant consulting that we do.\n\nQ:  That must have been a fairly daring thing for him to do.\n\nWhiteman:  Well, in a way it was, except that he had one fairly large project in his pocket called the World Trade Center.  We ended up designing and putting into operation a quarter of a million square feet of food space, which is a lot of food space.\n\nQ:  In the World Trade Center.\n\nWhiteman:  In the World Trade Center.  And it was a project that began in 1970 and ended in 1979.\n\nQ:  So that paid the bills.\n\nWhiteman:  We put everything into operation at the World Trade Center.  Hilton International—let me back up.  We were consultants to the Port Authority.  We created the master plan and the designs for everything that was to be built there.  The Port Authority went out looking for operators, and, ironically, they got very few responses because, number one, of the economic conditions in Lower Manhattan; number two, nobody wanted to operate that thing on top of the building which was absolutely going to be a failure.  But they were interested in all the other stuff.\n\tThe winning proposal was from Hilton International, which is not the same as Hilton domestic.  It was owned at the time by TWA.  Hilton International signed a master lease to operate all the restaurants in the World Trade Center, with the proviso that we open everything and run it for three years, because they had absolutely no idea how to do this.\n\nQ:  You did that with them or without them or what?\n\nWhiteman:  We did that.  They signed the lease.\n\nQ:  Hilton International signed the lease to—\n\nWhiteman:  Yes, and they formed a wholly owned subsidiary called INHILCO.  It’s an inversion of Hilton International.  Basically, we became INHILCO for the first three years of its operation, and at the end of the three years, we gave them the key and they operated it from then on, and we went back to being consultants.\n\nQ:  So your company set up all the restaurant possibilities in—\n\nWhiteman:  And ran them.  We opened them and ran them for three years.  Not very many companies can say this, but we moved from the 106th floor to the 63rd floor, so we moved down a lot.  [laughs]  And moved our consulting offices to the 63rd floor.\n\nQ:  About how many people were involved in food service in the World Trade Center?\n\nWhiteman:  Eight hundred or so.\n\nQ:  Did that project change the nature of how the company saw itself, your company?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, it didn’t have to see itself, because everybody else saw it.  They defined us, and that’s when we were publishing this non-client list.\n\nQ:  Oh, you actually published it?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, I mean, amongst ourselves.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  I see.  What kinds of non-clients were there?  What kinds of projects did you not want to take on?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, sometimes we would get things in places where we’d have to change planes to get there, and we said the hell with that.  [laughs]  Sometimes they were just too small.  Our fees were very high, so very often they were just too small or too impractical or just not interesting.  To this day, we take on jobs that generally are either interesting or too rich to say no, but we do a fair number of jobs for people who come to us with absolutely no money and a couple of kids who need some help.\n\nQ:  What kinds of projects might they be?\n\nWhiteman:  Oh, somebody might be opening a prototype for a health food store chain and they don’t really have any financing, and so we’ll do it for next to nothing.\n\nQ:  Why?\n\nWhiteman:  If it’s interesting.  You know, it’s one of those sometimes you look at a job and say, well, why not?\n\nQ:  The restaurant business has changed considerably from the time you all started working with restaurants, yes?\n\nWhiteman:  Oh yes.\n\nQ:  How would you describe that?\n\nWhiteman:  It’s changed more than once, and I’ll describe it to you after I have a bladder break.  [laughs]\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  We were talking about changes in the restaurant business.\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Could you describe them over time?\n\nWhiteman:  There have been a whole cluster of changes since we started working.  As I said earlier, most successful restaurants were run by single proprietors who usually were people in the front of the house rather than famous chefs.  Nobody knew who chefs were.  They knew who the owners were.  There were a whole series of shifts around the time we started working.  One was that people from other fields found it respectable to work to work in the restaurant business.\n\nQ:  From other fields like?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, two people come to mind, but they’re just examples of a larger number.  Jeremiah Tower, who was an architect, decided to be a restaurateur, opened a very successful restaurant in San Francisco called Stars and became famous because of it and opened a whole bunch of other restaurants.  Barry Wine, whose earlier life I just can’t recall, but it had nothing to do with food, opened The Quilted Giraffe in New York, and it became a success.  And there were a whole group of people who maybe ten years earlier would never have considered working in the restaurant business as a profession because it wasn’t really respectable and it wasn’t a profession.\n\nQ:  When are we talking about right now with Barry?\n\nWhiteman:  We’re talking about the late sixties.  There were people who got into the restaurant business around that time who had gone to college, graduated with good degrees and gone to good schools, who decided that they couldn’t bear to work for a large corporation.  It was that time of life when everybody was anti-corporate, and so they began to work in restaurants as cooks and chefs.  It became an outlet for creative expression and began to lend an air of respectability to the restaurant industry.  Very big change.\n\nQ:  How did that change the kind of people who ate in restaurants and the habit of eating in restaurants?\n\nWhiteman:  I’m not sure that’s what changed the kinds of people who ate in restaurants.  I don’t think you can isolate one thing from another.  It was around that time that increasingly large numbers of women joined the workforce, and as a result of that, the number of people who had to eat out every day multiplied and continued to multiply, by the way, until just a couple of years ago.  Two things happened when women began to enter the workforce.  Number one, the number of meals that had to be eaten out during the day multiplied, and, number two, the number of people who had income to eat out more frequently in the evening also multiplied, while at the same time the amount of time people had to prepare food at home diminished.  So irrespective of who was doing the cooking in the restaurants, there was an increase in demand, and that increase in demand made it possible for the kinds of people that I’m talking about to get into the restaurant industry, which otherwise might not have been the case.  So that was a very big change.\n\tOn top of that, food became a matter of style rather than just something you ate, and people began to link food with design as a matter of self-expression.  I don’t know what the year was, but if you go back to the beginnings of a magazine called Apartment Life, you will find in that the beginnings of the integration of food with design.  So at some point in the process, designers began to become familiar household names and people began to talk about who designed the restaurant and where the china came from and who designed the uniforms, so it became part of the vocabulary.\nAlso at the same time, we began to see the introduction of a new kind of American cooking, which was basically the injection of foreign ingredients into an American vocabulary, and that was the beginning of the so-called fusion food.  So it was in the 1970s, I guess, that you began to get smoked duck burritos with brie and topped with caviar.  I used to make fun of all this mixed-metaphor cooking, except that’s really the way people today have told us they want to eat.\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nWhiteman:  I mean that people no longer distinguish their food by its geography or by its ethnicity, because American food has now become this fusion amalgam of all manner of ethnicity, and nobody cares where the food came from anymore because it didn’t come from anywhere.  It got smooshed together, which was not the case when Jim wrote American Cookery.\n\nQ:  That’s an old copy.  Is that Roseanne’s or yours?\n\nWhiteman:  He inscribed it to me.\n\nQ:  Oh, how spectacular.\n\nWhiteman:  So it’s 1972.\n\nQ:  How wonderful.\n\nWhiteman:  There’s not much in the way of ethnicity in here.  This is basically American regional cooking, as it was known at the time, and it was American, so you won’t find heuvos rancheros in there, and if you did, it would be a standard heuvos rancheros.  It wouldn’t be a heuvos rancheros with naturally raised local oxtails, which you would not be surprised to find that on today’s menu or made with organic duck eggs with a salad of micro greens on the side.\n\nQ:  I refuse to pay for micro greens in a restaurant.  Just seems wrong.\n\nWhiteman:  But that’s been the major change.  The major change has been, in my opinion, the injection and acceptance of all manner of foreign ingredients into American food and certainly American restaurants, and the way for that was paved by the food and the design magazines that arose out of the increased demand that I began to talk about earlier.  We also became more prosperous, so we could afford to buy these things or experiment with them without feeling that we were going to be beaten to death in our pocketbooks.\n\nQ:  But what happened when we weren’t more prosperous the last time around?\n\nWhiteman:  Last time around that we weren’t prosperous was 2001, and it was then that the goofball in the White House told us to go shopping, which we did.  We just didn’t know we didn’t have the money to go shopping with.  Before that was 1987 was a crash, didn’t last very long.  Most of the recessions have been fairly short.  1982 was a bad one, and a lot of people were out of work.  But the cycles have been pretty short, so the restaurant industry has continued to grow until last year, but it hasn’t changed eating habits.\n\nQ:  What I was wondering about was during those periods, it seemed like, or people write about them as comfort foods came in maybe quickly, left quickly, I don’t know, foods that were more affordable to make and therefore to order in a restaurant.\n\nWhiteman:  Well, meatloaf makes its resurrection every time there’s a downturn in the business cycle, and each time it’s come back with more levels of creativity attached to it and it’s always a little bit fancier.  Macaroni and cheese is the same thing.  What started out as macaroni and cheese became macaroni and cheese with prosciutto, and the next time around it became macaroni and cheese with confit duck.  [laughs]  What you’re seeing right now is gourmet hamburgers in all manner and variations and gourmet hotdogs.  I think they’re both phenomena and that they represent people’s desire to trade down without feeling poverty-stricken, and so they’re trading down at the same time that they’re trading up.  Rather than trading down to a lowly hamburger or a lowly hotdog, you’re now getting—I just saw one the other day, I saw a Chilean hotdog with sauerkraut, mayonnaise, and a huge spritz of guacamole on it.  There’s a guy in Chicago selling confit duck hotdogs with truffle oil.  I’m sorry.  And I have one in my files of somebody who’s taken a hotdog and wrapped it in Monterey jack cheese and wrapped that in a burrito and thrown it in the deep fryer.  So all those are premium hotdogs, so people who are not spending fifty dollars on a steak are saying, “I’m not going to spend two dollars on a hotdog.  I’m going to spend six and treat myself well.”\n\nQ:  Could you tell me the circumstances of how James Beard gave you that book?  Do you remember?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  We were still working together.  We hadn’t opened Windows on the World yet.  We were at a cocktail party for the publishing of this book, which I believe was at The Coach House in Greenwich Village, which no longer exists, and he inscribed the book to me then.  I remember that day.  I’d been having a really hard time with Joe, who was just impossible to work for, and Jim said, “Well, how’s it going?”\n\tI said, “I can’t get this and I can’t get that and I can’t get anywhere with him.  I’m feeling terrible.”\n\tJim was really a mountainous man.  I remember him putting his big hand behind my head and putting my head against his enormous chest and holding it there and saying, “Don’t worry.  It’ll be all right.”  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Did you ever go to dinners at his house or anything like that?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  I used to have a lot of meetings at his house, both houses, because he had one before the one that’s now the James Beard House.  He had one across the street from the Jefferson Market Courthouse, and it was equally bizarre.  [laughs]  He was so big, he just filled up all the space.\n\nQ:  Could you describe what the dinner parties were like there?\n\nWhiteman:  They were really rather simple.  There were not a lot of show-offy things.  People weren’t doing show-offy cooking, and Jim didn’t because his food tended towards being voluptuous and cuddly.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nWhiteman:  And a lot of ferment and conversation.  But he wasn’t really so much about doing a tour de force for dinner.  If you asked me what I ate, I couldn’t tell you.\n\nQ:  And the meetings you had there were not accompanied by food?\n\nWhiteman:  No.  Usually something to drink.  I think it was with Jim that I had my first Perrier, not knowing what it was before then.\n\nQ:  But he had been in France and knew.\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  And he had this bizarre electric kitchen, which was part of his cooking school.  Nobody cooked with electricity, except he was being paid by the electric people and had an electric kitchen.  So all these housewives used to come in and have to learn how to push the button in advance.  [laughs]  “In ten seconds, I’m going to have to reduce the heat, so I’ll push the button now.”\n\nQ:  Did you ever go to any of the classes?\n\nWhiteman:  No.  Jim, of course, was highly visible.  You couldn’t sneak anywhere with Jim.  But wherever we went—because he worked with us also at The American Restaurant in Kansas City, where we were consultants, which was a development owned by Hallmark Cards.\n\nQ:  Was it for the Hallmark people?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  You’d have to get to the airport a half hour early if you were with Jim.  Number one, he walked slowly, but, number two, people kept on coming up to him.  You couldn’t get anywhere.  I remember once walking with him from somewhere in Windows on the World to the elevator in order to go downstairs, and three people came up and wanted to say hello.  One woman in particular came up to him and said, “You’re not going to remember me, because it was ten years ago and it was in Detroit, and you were at my house doing something or other.”\n\tAnd he looked at her and said, “I think it was in Grosse Pointe, not Detroit.”  [laughs]\n\nQ:  And he was right?\n\nWhiteman:  And he was right.  And he wore the most crazy combination of patterns and dots and designs.  Nothing matched, but because he was so big, he looked like a multimedia presentation when he walked.  So he was really highly visible.\n\nQ:  How did he get along with Joe Baum?\n\nWhiteman:  Oh, famously.  They’d been friends forever.  I remember once somebody picked him up from a meeting at the World Trade Center.  I guess it was Clay Triplett, but I could be wrong.  And they picked him up in a Volkswagen.\n\nQ:  Oh, my. \n\nWhiteman:  And he had to be squeezed into the front seat of this little thing, and when it drove off, the car was listing to starboard.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  When did Joe Baum die?\n\nWhiteman:  Before 9/11, so it probably would have been, I don’t know, ’99 or maybe 2000.\n\nQ:  Did that change the nature of your business?\n\nWhiteman:  No.  Joe and I went our separate ways some years before that, and we divided the company into Joe having a small share of the consulting company and my having a share of the operating company.  We divided into an operating company and a consulting company.  It was the consulting company that had the contract to redo the Rainbow Room, and it was the consulting company that won the competition to take over and rebuild Windows on the World after the 2003 bombing.  The consulting company turned the operation over to the operating company.\n\nQ:  That’s what I was going to ask you.  But you worked together?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  The consulting company got royalties and a big consulting fee from the operating company in order to have it created and put into operation.\n\nQ:  But the company now bears both your names?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, it did then.  I don’t think there’s a Merrill Lynch or a Pierce, Fenner and Smith any longer, but it’s still called Merrill Lynch.\n\nQ:  I see what you’re saying.  They were two different divisions of the same company?\n\nWhiteman:  No.  The operating company had a different set of investors and partners than the consulting company.  The consulting company only had the three of us.\n\nQ:  So what kinds of projects do you have now on the boards?\n\nWhiteman:  Today I’m doing five restaurants in a hotel in Chandigarh, which is the capital of Punjab in northern India.  I’m working on the master plan for mixed-use development in San Antonio that will have about 60,000 square feet or so of food space.  I don’t know what that food space is yet, except that part of it will be a public market, and the rest will be various restaurants once I figure out what the demand and the criteria is going to be.  And we’re working on the food program, a new 60-million-dollar skate house for winter and summer in Prospect Park here.  Oh, there’s an example.  I’m doing that for nothing because they don’t have any budget.\n\nQ:  It’s a skate house?\n\nWhiteman:  There is a Wollman Skating Rink, ice skating rink, in the park right now.  That’s going to be demolished, and a new skate house, big skate house, is going to be built with two rinks, one for ice hockey, one for regular ice skating, and then one will convert to roller skating in the summer, so it will be a year-round attraction.\n\nQ:  Where, compared to where we are right now?\n\nWhiteman:  We can walk to it in about twenty minutes from here.\n\nQ:  Is it a larger company now?\n\nWhiteman:  No, it’s smaller.  Joe died.  One of our other partners retired when he turned sixty-five.  So now it’s me and Rosanne, and it’ll probably never get any bigger.  We don’t chase after a lot of work.  It comes and it keeps us busy enough.  I’m now seventy-one, so I don’t necessarily want to spend all my life, all my time of the rest of my life, working, although I’d like to work for the rest of my life, and, again, if the projects are interesting.  So I give four or five speeches a year.  I write three or four articles a year for Food Arts magazine.\n\nQ:  Describing where you think things are going or what?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes, or something that interests me.  Then we do two or three large consulting jobs a year, and that’s more than enough.  I will never again operate a restaurant, ever.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  So the journalism background didn’t hurt after all, though, if now you’re writing.\n\nWhiteman:  No, the journalism didn’t hurt at all, nor did the graduate work in economics, and neither had anything to do with writing journalistically.  It had to do with the ability to put together a project and describe it to a client as part of a written document, so the programs that we wrote and continue to write bear no resemblance to any other consultant’s programs in terms of their language, their structure, and what they bring from the outside to a project.\n\nQ:  What is the difference between theirs and yours?\n \nWhiteman:  Well, a typical consultant company’s program document for a project is usually a format into which they plug the language and the words in and the concept, but they’re all the same.  Ours are far more complex, and each one is written in a completely different manner, depending on the project.\nI should mention along the way that until this year we had created more New York Times three-star restaurants than anybody.\n\nQ:  Oh, no kidding.\n\nWhiteman:  Got tied this year by Danny Meyer.\n\nQ:  So those three-star restaurants were?\n\nWhiteman:  The three-star restaurants were the Rainbow Room on top of Rockefeller Center; the Market Bar and Dining Rooms; the Cellar in the Sky in the World Trade Center; Aurora, which is a three-star aesthetic triumph that we had on East 49th Street, the tax loss for which I still carry forward.  [laughter]  And the Hudson River Club, which closed after the 9/11 disaster, in the World Financial Center.\n\nQ:  I suspect there may be additional ones.\n\nWhiteman:  You never know.\n\nQ:  Thank you.  This has been a lot of fun.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tWhiteman - 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n","description":"One of the most ubiquitous eating venues today is the food courtâ€”an essential component in suburban shopping malls, office complexes, railroad stations, and other public spaces. Upscale versions are currently very fashionable in New York City.

It’s June 15, 2009, and I am here with Clark Wolf.\nGood afternoon.\n\nWolf:  Hi there.\n\nQ:  I thought we would start with my asking you to tell me something about, first of all, where and when you were born and a little bit about your childhood.\n\nWolf:  Certainly.  Well, I’m first-generation American, and I was born in southern California, actually in Los Angeles, at Queen of Angels Hospital in 1951.  My Jewish immigrant mother woke up surrounded by nuns and was quite shocked until she remembered where she was.  I don’t remember that; this is just family lore.\n\tBoth my parents came to this country, my mother when she was twelve, and my father when he was about eight months old.  The reason I say this is because it’s very much a part of my early upbringing.  My mother came at twelve.  She was a concert pianist.   She was a very talented handworker.  She wove things and embroidered things and did handwork and won awards in Kishenev in Maldova, and in Europe was an award-winning concert pianist and craftsperson. I don’t really know what it was called, but she won something at nine or something.\n\nQ:  Amazing.\n\nWolf:  For many years, we weren’t really sure, but after my parents passed away last year, we discovered my mother’s lycée school report card, so she did, in fact, study French and Italian and English and all those things that we had only heard she’d done.  We had proof.\n\t[Referring to street noises]  Is that disturbing?  Okay.  It’s New York.\n\nQ:  Exactly.\n\nWolf:  Anyway, she came to this country at twelve in ’39.  They sold everything.  They were landed Jews, which wasn’t too common.  They had a forest and lumber company.  This is my mother’s mother’s family.  But my mother’s mother died when my mother was two, and she’s a woman for whom I’m named, Clara.  When Clara died, her sister, Sonia, was made to marry my grandfather.  This is fundamental because this is fundamental.  So I was raised by my parents, but I grew up with my grandfather Misha Morris Barenstein (Bernstein), and Sonia, really my Great-Aunt Barenstein, and they were in Hollywood.  They were in La Crescenta, which is near Pasadena.  They had a huge impact on my life early on because they were quite sweet to us when we were children, when we were small, and my grandfather always grew grapes, anything.\nMy earliest memory of seeing them was in La Crescenta at a home that had a gas lamp out front, glass, dark burgundy with a column between it, and in the back after the yard was a vineyard.  I’d always assumed that it was there, but I’m told that my grandfather apparently planted vineyards wherever he lived.  This is every house.  When they were in the Hollywood Hills, they would buy a house, fix it up, and sell it.  That’s what they did as immigrants.  And they had an apartment building at one period of time where I used to visit them and stay with them for a week at a time every summer.\n\tSo my grandmother cooked, but my grandfather—I think I got it more from him—my grandfather planted fruit trees and planted herbs and tomatoes, and I never saw a tomato in the refrigerator.  I never saw a melon in the refrigerator.  There was fresh cheese in a Melmac bowl, plastic bowl, on the table at lunch and at breakfast every day that I was there.  I have very, very vivid memories around food with my grandparents, and it was very positive.  It was very beautiful.\n\tI remember being in the Hollywood Hills with my grandparents in a pink stucco, two-story, and roses and dichondra.  My grandfather had planted fruit trees on the terraced hill behind, and we stood there one day and suddenly from above a deer came down and really very comfortably reached up and began eating a peach off the tree.  I said, “Grandpa, Grandpa, the deer is eating the peach.”\n\tAnd my grandfather said to me, “So, somebody has to eat it.”  I mean, that was part of what he did.  As a human being, it was part of his job in life to grow food.\nI’ll go into this a little bit more, but what’s interesting is that when they came to visit me in the eighties when I first moved to New York, we were at Orloff’s Delicatessen.  That’s where they wanted to go, to a delicatessen.  And my grandfather began to tell the story of his family.  Now, my mother’s mother’s family, Sonia’s family, was fancy, two carriages, one ebony inlaid mother-of-pearl and the other a wagon, depending on if the Russians or the Romanians, you know, what the Hapsburgs were doing that Thursday.  But I guess my mother’s father’s family wasn’t so fancy.  They had one or two inns and a peasant grocery.  When my grandfather said, “Yeah, so we had a grocery, dried beans and salted fish in a barrel,” my grandmother got hysterical and said, “Shut up, shut up, shut up.  It’s no good.  It’s no good.”  She didn’t want me to know that they were low-class.  Here I was being a fancy grocer, coming to the world through the pantry, and as a food professional that was extraordinary, and I came by it genetically, honestly.  My grandfather always had a big, big huge bar of chocolate in his back pocket.  So we’d hug him and steal the chocolate.\n\tSo the point is that good food was part of everything.  Affection and food went together from my grandparents’ perspective.  Growing up in the San Fernando Valley, we were surrounded by orange groves and lemon groves.  We had a tangerine tree, an apricot tree, Meyer lemons, roses, lilacs.  To me there is something very connected between the smell of a real garden rose and the scratch of the skin of a Meyer lemon.\n\tIronically, my mother, who made her debut on the stage of the Hollywood Bowl with the André Previn’s Los Angeles Youth Philharmonic, didn’t do a whole lot with that.  She married my dad and they settled down and had kids, and my mother was not a very good cook.  She, being Romanian and being an artiste, she cooked things until they were dark brown.  Truly, I used to joke that I was twenty before I found out that zucchini wasn’t brown, you know.  Very funny.  And I think we were of modest means.\n\nQ:  Do you know why they went to California?\n\nWolf:  Family.  My father’s father, they went to Philadelphia first, and then they found that my father and his mother, who also died early but in her sixties, and apparently I’m very much like these two women who are dead, so I can kind of do whatever I want, because there’s no model, he had scarlet fever as a child and his mother was asthmatic. It was mostly for health reasons they moved to California.\n\tMy mother’s family came because my maternal grandfather had a brother who had moved out before, and apparently it was very similar to where they all were from in Odessa and Maldova.  I mean, Maldova and Kishenev sound a little like the San Francisco Bay Area in some ways, rocky vineyards and towns, five or six hundred thousand that was the center of a larger—you know, it sounds kind of similar.  But, of course, southern California was then the promised land in the thirties and forties, certainly not during the Dust Bowl, but by the end of the thirties and in the forties and fifties, it was something.\n\tMax Factor is somehow related, the makeup guy.  My father’s father owned a piece of Wilshire Boulevard, selling it moments before it was valuable.  But he had a dry goods store, and there was very much actually a memory of my father’s father in and around Fairfax Boulevard and Kantor’s Delicatessen, and the smell and the community and the taste and the sharing of food was very, very important.\n\tI visited my great-grandfather.  We think he was anywhere between 96 and 106, depending on how close my mother was in relationship to the truth that year or month; we didn’t know.  But whenever we visited, he had a paper bag full of grapefruit or oranges for the kinder.  So, love, health, safety, food, citrus, season, all that stuff was very much ingrained.\n\nQ:  Was anybody a good cook in all this family connection?\n\nWolf:  My grandmother was a good baker.  She made strudel.  I mean, oddly, there was a real respect for the food.  She had compote.  That’s what I remember most about my grandmother, strudel with cheese layers and sometimes fruit or honey, and compote twelve months a year, and it was always different.  Sometimes it was in a glass jar in the fridge, cooked.  Sometimes it was on the stove, stewing.  Sometimes it was in a bowl, kind of macerated.  But she always had fruits from the garden enhanced by some fruits that you bought, enhanced by whatever it is she did, and it was a one kind of expressive word, “compote.”\n\nQ:  What is that?\n\nWolf:  It was a state of mind.  It was not a compote.  It was a compote.  It was like plasma.  You know what I mean?  It was a critical element of our lives.\n\nQ:  What was your education like?\n\nWolf:  Well, interestingly, I went to a grammar school around the corner.  I mean, I walked.  I went to junior high school, where there was one black person, and I remember bad food.  It was terrible.  When I got to high school, I was the editor of the newspaper, the school newspaper, and I was in an advanced placement class, so I began to get—it was a very middle or lower middle class, middle middle class, but white, suburban education.  Pretty mediocre, but apparently better than most now.\n\tMy brother went to college.  I have an older brother, one older brother.  That’s it.  He was tested in the third grade with an IQ of 185.  He went to college at about fifteen or sixteen on a full scholarship to USC and then came home, and all the family resources went that way.  So when it was time for me to go to school, and I always felt I was supposed to, I did the first thing I could, which in those days was to go to San Fernando Valley State College, which became university, Northridge State University, and then after doing that for two and a half years and that was $35 a semester the first year.\nWhen I left school, I was at San Francisco State University, and it was $235 a semester.  I transferred, and the two state colleges, those two particular campuses had been elevated to state universities.  They weren’t on a caliber with, let’s say, Cal, Berkeley, certainly not Stanford, and they were much better than a community college.  I ended up getting into Northern California by auditioning for the only department that I could get into that was of interest, which was the drama department.  There was apparently at that time very good, mostly children’s theater, but I had to audition, so I had to get in, and I got in, and I was pretty proud of that.  Did that for about a year, and blech.\n\tBut transferred to the English department, because when it became evident that I needed to declare a major, I had a 3.1 overall and a 3.89 in English literature classes, so I clearly was an English major.  And Kay Boyle and Mark Harris and these other, Carolyn Schrodes,  S.I. Hayakawa, they’re amazing semanticists and poets and writers at this school at that time because it was a kind of a public thing, and because this was post-fifties and sixties, there was in the Bay Area great respect for writerly efforts.\n\tSo I was in a department and actually got a student assistantship, which was how I survived, $2.45 an hour, in a group that was very smart.  In my early twenties when I moved to San Francisco, I became friends with my detective fiction teacher, who was in her early thirties.  So all my friends were ten years older and they were professors.  They were highly literate.  So I began to get an education not just in the written word, but in social discourse and intercourse.  And, of course, they and we drank a lot.  It was, you know, San Francisco.  But these were very interesting people.\n\nQ:  What was your living situation like?  Were you by yourself?\n\nWolf:  Oh, my.  When I moved to San Francisco, I had a roommate for a very brief time, a couple of times.  It was terrible.  I just was not the kind of person that has a roommate.  I was very independent.  But I was sometimes living on Kraft dinner, nineteen cents a box.  It was tough.\n\tBut I really did—and I claim this honestly—I had an epiphany over at the San Francisco Chronicle with a Dungeness crab, and at their recommendation, “Take this newspaper and lay it down.  Buy a freshly boiled Dungeness crab.”  I bought a half, a baguette of Boudin sourdough bread.  I thought it was pronounced “bo-dayn,” but it was “boo-deen” or “bo-deen” or something.  Mayonnaise, Meyer lemon, and a bottle of Wente Brothers chenin blanc.  It was pretty bad, but the crab was great, and I just thought, “This is really cool.”\n\nQ:  Why did that appeal to you, I mean, why doing it?\n\nWolf:  Well, I moved to San Francisco for transformation.  I moved to San Francisco to not be in the fifties or suburban California.  I moved there to be in the world.  I saw San Francisco and I went there.  I had gone as a child.  All the time we grew up, if dad was doing okay, we got a one-week vacation.  If dad was doing a little bit better, we got a two-week vacation, or they were both working, and I could always tell because—and I still have it—my mother had a black very ornately painted tin sewing box.  My grandmother made Mandel bread, hard cookies, basically biscotti de Romania, you know.  And if it was half full, we were going for a week.  If it was all full, we were going for two weeks.  So, yeah, and we went up and down the coast and all through California, from the age of, I’m told, when I was four months old was the first trip to Yosemite.  So we went to Yosemite and we went to Carmel and we went to the Sequoias and we went to Monterey and we to San Francisco and all those places.  So it was very normal to do that, and so I had seen San Francisco as a child, and I was enamored.\nSo I went there for transformation, and part of the transformation was to not eat Green Giant green beans almondine out of a plastic bag from the freezer, you know.  I thought that there was something transformative, and I immediately was connected by the social mobility of food.  It struck me as this magical, elegant, wonderful, visceral, sensual, metaphorical, poetical, tasty thing.  And I found very quickly that I had an affinity, so when I finally left the English department, the last thing I did was to cater the English department faculty party, 167 English teachers, and I covered, bound, a master’s thesis in foil, made them into steps and put palm trees on them and quotes from Shakespeare, you know.  “For one sweet grape, who will the vine destroy?”  I mean, it was hilarious.  I was the mascot of the department.\n\nQ:  How did you learn to cook so that you could actually cater something?\n\nWolf:  I was hungry.  My mother was a terrible cook.  Actually, I just took to it.  I don’t really remember.  My mother in our family was known for making the JELL-O salads.  This was a concert pianist with great aesthetic ability, and a beauty.  My mother was a very striking woman, and a lot of serious costume jewelry, and a brilliant gardener.  So she had some of them right, but she hadn’t the patience for cooking, or the taste, and also my father was her audience and my brother was her audience, and they just kind of scarfed it down or wanted it less interesting.  And I was the sissy, and I wanted something beautiful and delicious and wonderful.  Apparently, when I was a little kid, my aunt, who was a gal Friday at William Morris, took me to the Brown Derby, to Chasen’s, to Perino’s.\n\nQ:  Fabulous.\n\nWolf:  Again, I don’t remember except for one instance, but it was an often told story that, you know, I walked in to one of them and said, “We’d like the table by the window.” You know, that was my nature.  The one thing I do remember, and I was pretty young, I was expressive, let’s just say, with my body and hands and whatnot.  I was sitting at a table, and I think it was the Brown Derby, but I don’t remember.  I know it wasn’t Chasen’s, because I would remember the red banquettes, the red Hollywood booths.  A man came over to us and said, “I’m a director.  If that child can speak Italian, he’s in a movie.”\n\tAnd my mother said, “Sadly, he can’t.  He can speak ad nauseam, but not Italian.”\n\tSo I mean, I was quite gregarious, and I think also a natural for the catering business, I was in a youth group at synagogue.  I was Debra Winger’s youth group leader, and she and I are two of the few that got out, and many of them are still there.  I had fifty relatives, aunts and uncles and cousins, that are still in the Valley, if they’re not dead, or they moved out to the beach, ooh.  And I was hungry for something more interesting.\n\tBut as youth group leader, fifteen or sixteen, we gave parties and events, and I remember very vividly at the age of fifteen or fifteen and a half, I was the outgoing president of the youth group, and there was an incoming president, and we gave an inauguration night, or it was called something, I don’t know what, installation night.  And I knew that people were going to be paying $75 a couple for what was basically spaghetti on paper plates, and so it occurred to me that they needed to get something.  And I picked up a microphone, and the rest is history.  The point is that I knew that an evening and a dinner was more than a sum of its parts.  I got that message very early on, that you did the best you could with this and this and this and this, and you brought them all.  So they were all the elements that were interesting to me.\n\tWhen my parents turned—I guess when they were married thirty-five years, maybe, because I was already living in New York and I already had a boyfriend here, we all went to Yosemite for their anniversary, and the first night we stayed in these big cabins.  That was the other thing, is that we went to Yosemite.  When we were kids, we stayed in canvas tents and just ate whatever, you know, canvas tents with wooden bases that were six dollars a night.  But when we got a little bit older, the family would rent a couple of cabins in the Wawona Basin above Yosemite Valley.  Actually, it was called the Wolfs, which is funny.  These people had bought and built these cabins before it became a national park, and so they were allowed to keep it as long as they rented it out.  And the families would all stay together, cousins and aunts and uncles, you know, and other people who really weren’t relatives but always traveled with us, and we always thought they were cousins, they were longtime family friends, and all cooked together.\n\tAnyway, this one time, my boyfriend and I had our own cabin, but there was a big family cabin where we all gathered, and my mother wanted to be in charge of the dinner for the first night.  The main course of that dinner was a brisket, I joke, was conceived when I was.  It was black rock.  And we had bought some asparagus to bring along, and it was steaming away happily, and I said, “Mom, they’re done.”\n\tShe said, “No, they’re not.”\n\tI said, “Mom, they’re done.”\n\tShe said, “No, they’re not.”\n\t“Mom, it’s what I do for a living.  They’re done!”  You know what I mean.  And I took them off and rinsed them in cold water and put them on the table.  And my father ate asparagus for the first time in maybe twenty years, and my mother didn’t speak to me for a day and a half.  For her, they were supposed to be gray or grayer.  I mean, you know, I don’t know if it was the Romanian thing, because in that particular part of the world when she was growing up, things were cooked a lot.\nI also do think that we were very poor at times.  We were very strapped for money.  In his maybe forties or fifties, my dad had a heart attack after an automobile accident, and blah, blah, blah.  I remember as a kid, she would make a roast or a brisket and it would be parceled out.  “This is how much you’re having tonight,” you know.  Some of it was Depression left over, even though they weren’t in the Depression.  Some of it was my mother controlling us, and that was all the control she had.  Until she went to work when I was about twelve, she was a stay-at-home mom and she was one of those people who—my mother was pretty difficult.  She was quite wonderful in retrospect, but in fact quite difficult and wanted to see the world and wanted to be in the world, but wanted to be married and all that.  And what they did with women in those days is they gave them pills.  So my mother took pills, and later on, when she stopped taking the pills, she drank secretly, so that’s another whole story.  But it’s an element of it.  I don’t know, looking back, how many times my mother got plastered and served us mush.  Who knows.  You know what I mean?  We were not aware.  We didn’t drink in our house.  My dad had the same bottle of Cutty Sark forever, and every once in a while would have a little sip just to approach being butch in some ways.\n\tAlso then when she went to work, I was growing up, you know, and we fended for ourselves.  Again, I was raised in a household where my mother said, “I can’t be bothered.  This is so too much trouble.  It’s too much.  I’ve got too much to do.  It’s too upsetting and besides, no one cares anyway.” And my father kind of didn’t care and my brother didn’t care at all.\n\nQ:  You mean about the food?\n\nWolf:  About the food, yes.  I mean, you know, to this day, well, my brother’s still learning and getting better, but there’s great insecurity there.  For me, it was freedom.  I could tell the difference.  When I catered my parents’—I want to say twentieth, maybe twenty-fifth—no, twentieth because I was still living with them, I was in my teens, late teens—anniversary, I orchestrated it, and what I did was I got everybody in the family to bring what they were best at, and I knew.  I had a great aunt on one side—I shouldn’t say “ah-nt,” because we always said “ant,” but I can’t help it—who made brilliant kreplach, I mean, like air, and she made something that her family called bubby cookies.  She was their bubby, their grandmother.\nSo I had these little patches of—and if you grow up really knowing—because you eat in the height of the season—watermelon and asparagus and citrus fruits in the winter, you have those things.  Tomatoes, I really knew once what those things tasted like.  And then you tasted other things next to them, you know that this dog won’t hunt.  When you have some people in your family that make some things that are cookery and transcendent, then you know when other things are made that are lousy and leaden.\n\nQ:  The fresh vegetables and fruit that you ate, would you mother buy those too?\n\nWolf:  Oh yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she did.  I mean, again, we were not allowed white bread.  We fought a lot about Fritos and things like that.  She wanted us to be American enough, but not so American.  Canned vegetables were there for economy and convenience.  She preferred fresh, but when she, again, began working after I was twelve, it was harder, which in fact it wasn’t.  I mean, the irony is that if she had embraced it and taught me a little bit more and let me.  She was very afraid to let go of her domain.\n\tThe other thing is that I was a gay kid, and my father knew before I did.  My mother and I were very close, so my father, they were very nervous about my being a sissy any more than I already was.  So where I may have done things in the house—I mean, you know, this wasn’t a big, rolling lovely southern neighborhood.  This was a little cookie-cutter suburb.\nSo they were also quite concerned, I’m sure, that I not do too much at home that I repeat and be beaten for next door, and believe me when I tell you I was, you know.  I got home from school as quickly and as invisibly as I could because I was beaten up all the time, and it wasn’t even over—and the irony is and what’s funny about it is, in retrospect, there were other gay kids, but I was not particularly sissified in that respect.  I didn’t like sports.  I was verbal and I was intellectual.  And the irony is that I just spoke to a friend that I had not seen in years, we met in Berkeley at a party, and we locked eyes and later hooked up, and the first thing he said to me when we were alone was, “I didn’t know if you were gay or European,” which I’ve used as a joke for years.\nBut that part of what happened was my father knew gay from gay, because my dad had been in the army and my dad was a guy, and my dad was a good guy, a very good guy and sensitive human being.  My mother was an immigrant who came at twelve, not speaking very good English, and really wanted to get along and fit and wanted to protect her children.  You know what I mean?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nWolf:  And in a lot of ways, I’m guessing that she saw things that I might do that could be construed as foreign, as the enemy.  So food was not—in the fifties and sixties in southern California, it was all about—I remember going with my brother to McDonald’s, and it was nineteen cents.  We would go, the two of us, with a dollar.  It was a special occasion.  Mom said we could go to McDonald’s.  We would go together.  He’s two and a half years older.  We would walk, go to the Mickey D, get a hamburger and a French fries and a small Coke, each of us, and it was a dollar total, you know.  So it was a big deal.\n\nQ:  When you graduated from college, what did you think you were going to do next with your life?\n\nWolf:  I left college before I graduated.  I was in that very difficult period of time in the seventies where we didn’t know whether to commit or not commit.  We didn’t know whether to join the culture or fight the culture.  I was a second child, not a first child.  The simple difference is my brother went to USC on scholarship and then loans when he was taking too many drugs to maintain the scholarship at the full level, but when he got arrested for protesting against the war, one of his rich friends bailed him out.\n\tI went to a state college with my own money.  I supported myself all the way through school entirely.  So I was much more independent and cranky, and I was better at dinner parties.  I was amusing company, because I needed to be.  But I had to leave school when I couldn’t go anymore.  It was just “I can’t do this anymore.”\n\nQ:  Were you living at home?\n\nWolf:  No, no, no.  Well, in southern California—\n\nQ:  Oh, you couldn’t be.\n\nWolf:  —I did the first two years—\n\nQ:  That’s what I meant.\n\nWolf:  —living with my parents.  I didn’t leave until I was twenty, for two reasons.  One is that my brother had left so early and that had been so hard on them, I thought I would make up for it.  It was a huge mistake all around.  And then there was no money, so I knew when I had to go, I’d have to go it on my own, and it’s a little bit daunting or very daunting.  It’s terrifying.  And I did it.  But anyway, so I moved up and I finished, they came to the graduation.  I hadn’t finished; I had a couple things left to do.  But I got a couple of jobs.  I worked at the—\n\nQ:  Why did you leave?\n\nWolf:  I left because I was done, because I couldn’t do it anymore.  I was done.  All my friends and also because my parents so needed to be at that graduation.  It really didn’t matter.  So I went through it, as I say, and I told them later, but not immediately.\n\tI got a job.  Well, I was working in a family counseling agency.  I don’t know the order of all these things, but I got a job as a waiter on the railroad between Oakland and Chicago, and I have to say that was a real awakening as well.  I was often the only white person working.  We served six hundred people in forty-eight seats at ninety miles an hour in two hours.  Most of the food came out of the can, if you were lucky, or a bag.  It was pretty bad.  And yet some of the equipment was, number one, left over from so long before, that it was wood-burning.  There were stoves that were burning wood.  What they wouldn’t give for that now.  The food that we served was terrible.  The food that I ate was brilliant at times, because they were all black cooks and you would have gumbo and jambalaya and ribs and ham hocks and all this stuff.\n\nQ:  When you cooked for each other?\n\nWolf:  No, we didn’t cook for each other.  They cooked for us.  When the cooks cooked for the general public, they’d cook what was on the menu, designed by the company and out of a box or a bag or a freezer or a can.  But they made staff meal, and staff meal was genius.  And I just thought this was the coolest thing.\nI thought I was in a book.  I thought I was in a novel.  So I would always have a tan, a good haircut, a manicure, starched white shirts.  We wore all that funny little stuff, you know, jackets and bowties and all that stuff.  I loved it.  And two and a half days to Chicago, twenty-six-hour layover, two and a half days back, sometimes double and triple out, which means you left the next day.\n\tWhen I went to Chicago, when we got to Chicago, I had to remember, number one, none of them would share a hotel room with me.  There was a given hotel room, meaning they gave you a hotel that was like worth about nine dollars a night, if you can only imagine on the South Side of Chicago near the train station.  Yeah, I didn’t stay there too often.  So you took your tips and got yourself a little bit better hotel room, usually with a friend, but most of the time if I was with a mostly black crew, they wouldn’t room with me, and it wasn’t because I was gay, it was because I was, you know, a white guy.\nSo I would save my pennies, and I went to the Pump Room, I would go to a little café or I would go to the coffee shop of a big hotel to be in a big hotel, and then get up the next morning and go to the Art Institute or the Art Museum of Chicago, Chicago Art Museum.  Do you know what I mean?  I’d been in San Francisco, but San Francisco compared to Chicago is nothing.  I’d never been to New York yet.  So to me, this was a big city, and it also the rest of America.  I was amazed.\n\tThen when I could eat chocolate, I would go to Marshall Field’s and buy Frango mints and eat each one very slowly as it melted in my mouth.  So it was wonderful.  Do you know what I mean?\n\nQ:  I do.\n\nWolf:  I also knew that I could really enhance the experience of people’s travels across the country by how I treated them at the shaking and rumbling dining table.\n\nQ:  It was somewhat formal service, wasn’t it?\n\nWolf:  It was old-fashioned service.  It was white tablecloth and lots of silverware and all that stuff.  It was kind of ridiculous.  But it was wonderful.  It was vestigial, but it was brilliant.  And the old black cooks would tell me stories about how they used to have to sleep under the tables and how at times during certain wars if you were black and you weren’t in the army or whatever it was, they would pull them out of service and you had to live in the dining car because that’s where you lived.\nI mean, so I got this whole other—and here I’m first-generation American Jew, so I had survivor’s guilt implanted DNA and also quite specifically.  I did have relatives who died, and I was always told they sold their property at a loss, but they sold it and got out.  They were stopped in Gibraltar on the ocean liner by Nazis, my mother and her parents, and the Nazis boarded, but somehow they got through, bribes or whatever it was.  So the point is I was really lucky, and it was told to me over and over in many, many ways.  I have all kinds of—every survivor’s guilt you can think of, pick three.\nSo I had an intense appreciation for life and intense need for it.  I grew up in a little room that I painted, myself, hospital white.  My mother had a thing about “Is it mother clean or Clarkie clean?”  You know.  So I was going to show her.  My mother, may she rest in peace, was a fairly crazy Virgo, very controlling, very frightened, and so I, kind of both to satisfy her and to also feel myself, had to kind of outdo her in a lot of ways, and I did in a lot of ways.  I made it cleaner than she could imagine.  Of course, in the process of painting that room, I totally destroyed a Chinese hooked rug that my grandparents gave me.\nSo it was a real combination of things, where my grandparents in some of their homes had room, a room, for me and my brother, so we had a room at our grandparents’ with a four-poster bed and a hooked rug and beautiful things on the wall.  Do you know what I mean?  My grandmother had amassed, with not a lot money but a great deal of taste.  It always had a what they called a gong, a dent in the back, it was cracked, but it was a good piece.\n\tI mean, I vividly remember brushing my grandmother’s hair in her house in their suite of rooms.  I mean, they lived beautifully.  They lived with great aesthetic style, and they were kind of grand.  So I had some of that grand in me.  You know what I mean?  And my mother was very striking and very dramatic in her way, but subscribing to this new fifties kind of household and always trying to do it in a way that made my father proud but not scared, a very, very tough line.\n\tOne of the great things, now that I think about this, that food offers is it can be something that’s actually brilliant and not scary.  My favorite thing in life with food is to be able to provide food that for the sophisticated person is extraordinary and resonates on a lot of levels at once, and for an inexperienced person or for a sheltered person, they’re not afraid of it.  I used to say, I want it for your Auntie Mame and your Aunt Millie in Ohio because that’s, to me, the universality of food.  On the emotional level and on the visceral level, I like things that are deeply satisfying.  I like the resonance of it all.\n\nQ:  What did you do after the—\n\nWolf:  Train?\n\nQ:  Yes. Dining car.\n\nWolf:  Well, in this period of time, I should say, I moved to San Francisco in 1972, at the age of twenty, with hair to my backside.  I mean, all the way down my back, I mean all the way, blue black.  The girl that I was dating at the time—I moved up to kind of figure out my thing about guys, but I fell in love with a woman, who I’m still friends with and who is very dear and who, also, I will say came from a very kind of refined family on a 250-acre gentleman farm in northern Illinois, and so I got some exposure to the table with her and from her.\n\tOne of the things that happened was she was renting a room in the house of a woman in Berkeley, and to make ends meet, I helped.  I cleaned that house once a week or once a month or twice a month, I don’t know what it was.  She was one of the original investors in a restaurant in Berkeley, and one day she said to me, “I’ll take you to this restaurant,” because I was an attractive young man who was good company.  I learned that one early on.  And my girlfriend was away or something, and so this woman, Jean Opton, took me, and because she had helped save the restaurant, she had a card that said meal for two once a week or once a month for the rest of your life.  There was no table, so we sat on overturned garbage cans in the kitchen of Chez Panisse.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nWolf:  She had a shop on Shattuck Avenue called The Kitchen, and she taught a lot of people in Berkeley how to pick up and hold a knife.  I bought dishes from her that I still have that were from the south of France, that are blue on white in a way that doesn’t disrupt the food, that has pattern.  And this is a woman who used to say, “When you’re done cleaning, please do the following.  Take the leg of lamb out of the refrigerator.  Roll it, braise it,” and she would give me these instructions that—\n\nQ:  Did you know what the instructions meant?\n\nWolf:  No, but I always did them, and she was always pleased.  So I, “What?”  This was, unbeknownst to me, one of the most refined people in a most refined community.  So those are my early—\n\nQ:  Did she teach you what something like what braise or boil or—\n\nWolf:  No, no.  She left a note.  Sometimes I think I must have looked things up or asked people or sometimes I just went by instinct.  “Brown all sides of the—.”\n\nQ:  Got it.\n\nWolf:  So there was only one pan out, so I browned it in that pan.  One time I put oil in the pan, and by putting oil in the pan it took longer to brown, so I tried to brown it without putting oil in the pan.  Do you know what I mean?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nWolf:  I didn’t do it that much, though, but everything—and you should have seen what she left me for lunch.  Oh, my god.  All I remember is how I feel about food.  The fireplace in the living room you could walk into.  It was on La Conte and Le Roy.  So the aesthetic was similar to my grandparents, except that it was arts and crafts as opposed to Hollywood Hills, you know, 1930s, and 19-teens, Hollywood, whatever.\n\nQ:  This was after the railroad car?\n\nWolf:  No.\n\nQ:  Before?\n\nWolf:  This was before.  Interestingly, it was before.  I mean, again, all that period of time is kind of overlapped.  No, it was before I went on the railroad, after Alice, after I stopped being involved with women.\n\tWhen I came back from the railroad, I was living on lower Nob Hill, Nob Hill adjacent, and, again, it was very important for me to walk through beautiful neighborhoods.  I had grown up in just nothing, in horrible suburban developments that just got worse and worse and worse.  So it was important for me to walk on Nob Hill, and San Francisco and Twin Peaks, and I did all those things and I had this youthful intensity and tension.\n\tI had a boyfriend, a really beautiful boy, who was very slender, very fragile, and delicate actually in a lot of ways.  His name is Stephan Hennigan.  He had pale skin, dark, dark brown hair, dark, dark, long, long lashes, and his eyes were actually golden, golden.  This beautiful creature.  He was a bird.  He was a creature, and in some ways transitional between man and woman, although he was definitely a boy.  And I said, “You know, you can’t just lie around the apartment every day.  You have to go get a job.”  And I said, “I saw a sign in a window.”  In those days, and still, you rent an apartment in San Francisco, and you get a job with a sign in a window that says “Apartment for Rent.  Don’t bother owner.  Call.”  Or “Knock quietly on Apartment 4,” which I thought was just the most romantic thing.\n\tAnyway, he came back very quickly and said, “This is the job for you.”  It was a sign in the window that said “Wanted, manager for soon-to-be-open cheese and wine shop.” \nSo in 1976, I got a job to open a cheese and wine shop.  I spent the first couple of weeks going back and forth.  These people had another shop in San Mateo, a wealthy suburb near Stanford University; South Bay, I think it was called.  So I would go and see how the other shop did it, and there were some lessons because it was kind of a franchise from the seventies of a cheese shop based in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nQ:  Why was it a job made for you?  I mean, why was that perception there?\n\nWolf:  I don’t know.  What was funny is that what I really wanted—and I wrote in a journal, and I had a lot of journals in those days—that I wanted a job that was vaguely European, not that I knew what that meant, and that had something to do with being in the community.  I wanted to connect somehow.  I wanted to feel like I belonged somewhere, and so it was about cheese.  I had been going to the co-op Cheese Board in Berkeley, and I liked food, and cheese was something I could learn, and I had to make the shop nice every day, and I was fastidious in that respect.  My brother used to joke that I had an apartment that was pathologically clean.\n\tSo I got this job, and I learned about it, went back and forth.  I remember the first week there was a woman that walked in, a big bouffant with a flip and argyle—I mean not argyle, alpaca sweater, and those stretchy pants with the straps, you know, really unfortunate.\n\nQ:  Stirrups.\n\nWolf:  Stirrups, yes.  And I said to the boy next to me, because I liked a good stage whisper when I could, “She really has got to stop going to Catherine Hearst’s hairdresser.”  Of course, this was in a period of time when Patty Hearst had been kidnapped and the Hearst family was very much on everybody’s mind, certainly in the Bay Area, and Catherine Hearst was a much maligned object of ridicule.\n\tSo this woman ordered a Cheddie Cheese Log, which is really cheese food.  It’s disgusting.  It’s byproducts and stabilizers and fillers and colors and flavorings and salts and some other chemicals rolled in very expensive chopped up pistachios and made into a log.\n\nQ:  This was for the cheese shop?\n\nWolf:  Yes.  We did it ourselves from a block of gelatinous mush.  Then she bought some caviar spread which is made from red—you know, who knows what it was, lump fish, some horrible thing, and creamed cheese.  Anyway, she writes a check, and it’s Catherine Hearst.\n\nQ:  Oh, my god.\n\nWolf:  It was Catherine Hearst.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nWolf:  So I thought to myself, “Taste, money don’t go together.  Okay, this is cool.  I’m poor.  I have taste.  Okay, cool.”  Do you know what I mean?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nWolf:  It was a huge life lesson, not to mention hilarious story.\n\tI managed this—the company went Chapter 11.\n\nQ:  Rather quickly.\n\nWolf:  The company that owned the two shops went Chapter 11 in the second week of my employment, so I got to know what that means, and so I basically—it was a subsidiary of an old family Italian business where the grandson inherited it in his thirties and liked limousines and cocaine and leggy, blonde women, so he spent it all.\n\tSo I got them to give me—he was introducing White Leopard.  It was a liqueur from the Campari people, and he said, “Oh, the cheese shop can cater it.”\n\tI said, “Okay, but you have to pay me, because I don’t have any money or cheese.  So give me $750.”  I remember this so vividly.  Cubed cheese is horrible, with toothpicks, but it got me going.  So little by little, I got revenue and product from the other store, and knowledge.\n\nQ:  But, meanwhile, it was still in Chapter 11?\n\nWolf:  The company was in Chapter 11.\n\nQ:  I see.\n\nWolf:  And I ran this little shop at the base of Nob Hill, and I made it nicer every day.  I brought out 350 cheeses every day for the walk-in and made it pretty.  There was nothing to go in the window, and so I would do window displays that I made up from packing material from—I would make a joke.  It was January, I did a January white sale, and it was white butcher paper, white peppercorns, and white wine.  I was amusing myself because I’d been a funny kid in the English department.  So I made jokes in the window, and it got in the San Francisco Chronicle.\nAnd I remember we’d open cracker boxes to give a sample to go with the cheese that was on the counter, and, of course, after a couple days, the crackers were stale.  So I had all these half boxes of crackers that you couldn’t give away.  In fact, they were bad.  So I thought, “What the heck am I going to do?”  There was a broken cornucopia basket that I shoved into the corner of the window, and it was a classic bay window with a wooden base and glass, you know, lovely, kind of old-school.  I put the cornucopia, shoved it in the corner and began making a flat mosaic of all the different crackers, you know.  Right?  I had a little friend who was in the neighborhood who was like a regular customer, kind of a groupie.  I can’t remember his name.  Daniel or David or something.  But he was a funny little kid with a beard, and he would wear a beret once in a while.  And I said, “Do you have a picture?”\n\tHe said, “I’m a photographer.”\n\tI said, “Would you bring me a picture of you in black and white in the beret, with your hands askew, like, ‘Oooh’?”\n\tAnd he said, “Sure.”\nAnd he mounted it on some cardboard for me, and I did this mosaic on the ground, and this picture of him with a big sign that just said “Crackers,” you know.  It was like—and people would stick their head in and go, “You are!  You betcha!  Me and you!” whatever.\n\tSan Francisco was very kind of—and this was at a time when Margaret Cho’s parents had a bookstore down at the corner.  This was on California between Market and Polk.  This is a very interesting time, you know.\n\nQ:  How old were you?\n\nWolf:  I was twenty-five.\n\nQ:  Were you the cheese buyer as well?\n\nWolf:  I was everything.  In fact, it was a while before I could hire anyone, and they could only come—it was so funny.  I really did get this pretty quickly, that I think they were two dollars an hour, four dollars an hour, something like that, and they would come in the afternoon for two hours or four hours.  I would immediately run up the hill, which was a park nearby, and lie in the sun to get a tan because besides the fact that I was vain, I truly believed that people would buy nicer cheeses from someone who looked well rather than somebody who looked sickly.  I needed to look like I had just gotten back from Biarritz so that they would buy a piece of cheese.  I was learning.  I was desperate, and I was also talking on the phone to people, and cheese people and cheese distributors would teach me how to do it.\n\tThere was a guy named Jim Sebastiani, a bearded guy, and he was vaguely from the Sebastiani wine family.  But he would come up in a little refrigerated van, and I would climb into the van, and there would be goat cheeses and French specialty cheeses that you wouldn’t believe.  I mean, this was the mid seventies.  They were just coming to this country.  They were amazing.  I would invariably buy more than I could afford and therefore have to sell them, so I friggin’ sold them, you know, because I had to.  If I didn’t sell them, there would be no money the next week.  Do you know what I mean?  There would be no money.  So I was learning how to run a business as if it were my own, never forgetting that it wasn’t, making a living entity, building it little by little.  Credit for cheese is short, seven days, and liquor even shorter, and cracker and specialty foods a little longer.  So I learned how to do that.\n\nQ:  You mean how to balance payments?\n\nWolf:  How to make it work.\n\nQ:  For vendors, yes.\n\nWolf:  Yes.  And I did all the bookkeeping, because when I was twelve, I helped my cousins, who were accountants, post and spread, so I knew what it was.  It’s not brain surgery.  Bookkeeping is very simple.  You write it here, you write it there, you add it up, you make sure, you know, it fits.  They gave us a little training focus on basic principles.  You always had the safe bolted into the ground, so that somebody looking through the window could see if you were being robbed, you know.  You don’t put it in the back.  Put it in the front.  That’s why grocery stores have it in the front window, so if you’re going to take a gun to me, everybody’s going to see, kind of thing, even though we did get robbed, but by an employee.  I learned all those lessons. \n\nQ:  There probably weren’t very many shops dedicated to cheese at that time.\n\nWolf:  Three.\n\nQ:  Three, in San Francisco?\n\nWolf:  Or four.  In the whole Bay Area.\n\nQ:  Oh, in the whole Bay Area?\n\nWolf:  Yes.  It was a big deal, and when people—I remember after doing it for a year or so—I did it for two and a half years.  When I moved to San Francisco in ’72, all I wanted was to see anyone that I knew.  It was like, I just wanted somebody to say, “Hey,” across the street.  Ten years later, I couldn’t get away from people I knew.  Because I was in retail, very visible.\n\tSo I remember, just in this little cheese shop, that I finally took a day off on Thanksgiving the following year or something, and I’m at the top of Twin Peaks with a friend, and there’s nobody there, and we’ve walked to the top, and up over the hill comes some guy, and he looks at me and he says, “Hey, Jarlsberg,” you know.  I was like arrrgh.  So thus began my love/hate relationship with being publicly known.\nBut, you know, it was good.  I mean, I borrowed an old Metropolitan, black and white Metropolitan.  I have photographs of it, a car, little car, for the grand opening from a friend, and put balloons on it and gave things away and tastes and all this.  I have still photographs today.  I made a fuss.  I said, “We’re here.”  I learned all these things.  Some of them were natural to me.  Some of them they kind of told us to do and I embellished, and some of them just—I don’t know.\n\nQ:  What kind of customers?\n\nWolf:  Oh, well, interesting, a broad range.  Quirky, mostly, the kind of people that shop in little shops.  When I later went to the Oakville Grocery, some of them came with me because I had gone on to something that was more comprehensive, and some of them wouldn’t come with me because the new shop was a little bit too fancy and worldly and upscale and public.  So, I mean, it was a cross-reference.  We had a lot of regular customers who were legendary we would talk about and tell stories about because they were—some were wonderful, some were horrible.\n\tThis one woman always used to drive us crazy, German woman who found something wrong all the time, would bring a cheese back three weeks later that I think had been under her couch.  I remember one day she walked in, Mrs.—oh, gosh, I can’t remember.  But one day she walked in with one black shoe and one white shoe, and she was saying she woke up that morning blind in one eye.  It was all we could do not to giggle for three weeks, because, I mean, these were characters.  You know what I mean?  This was a reality television show.  It was hilarious.\n\nQ:  Is that where you met Jim Beard?\n\nWolf:  Yes.\n\nQ:  How did that happen?\n\nWolf:  One day I was by myself, and the door darkened.  I mean, it was a little shop on one side of California Street, and the door darkened.  I looked up and I was like, what, is it a cloud, what, a storm?  And there was this huge man in a black leather trench coat that went from the sky to the ground, and, you know, wearing jeans and some big striped shirt or something, but black leather trench coat.  Terrifying.  I knew it was James Beard.  I don’t know why.  I guess I was aware of him, and I think he must have had a column in the paper and this, that, and the other.\n\nQ:  With maybe a picture, a picture of his face?\n\nWolf:  Oh yeah.  So I said to no one, “That’s James Beard.”  He came in and he bought Morbier’s, St. Nectaire, and Appenzeller.\n\nQ:  Morbier’s, St.—\n\nWolf: Morbier, which is a French cheese that has—\n\nQ:  Ash.\n\nWolf:  —a line of ash in the center, separating the morning from the evening milk.  Appenzeller, which is an alpine melting cheese.  And St. Nectaire, which is a real, from the Savoie, table cheese with a natural rind.  All complex, interesting, fairly sophisticated, specific cheeses.  And he says, “You know, my doctor says I’m not supposed to have any of these things.  I’d like some of this, some of that.”  And we had a short little chat, and he walked out.\nAbout a year later, I had been hired to do the cheese department of the Oakville Grocery.  The Oakville Grocery was originated in Oakville, which is a little town across from the Mondavi winery on Highway 29 in the Napa Valley.  In the thirties, it was the general store, had a post office and everything.  In the seventies, it became the supply hut for the Mondavi farm workers, sold beer and pretzels and potatoes and sandwiches, whatnot.  Then as Michael James and Billy Cross, of the Great Chefs of France, this couple of crazy, you know, very flamboyant gay men, actually, were bringing great chefs from France.  It was called the Great Chefs of France, and then there were the Great Chefs of the World.  Troisgros and La Notre and Bocuse and all these people were coming to do one-week cooking classes for rich ladies from either the Napa Valley or Texas, mostly the two.\n\nQ:  In the Oakville Grocery?\n\nWolf:  In the Mondavi winery, in their kitchen across the road.\n\tSo we were the grocery.  Joe Phelps, Joseph Phelps, the winemaker actually now, but at the time he had been a billionaire, which in those days was a lot of money, from Hensel Phelps Construction in Denver, huge, freeways, highways, towns, whatever.  He had started Phelps Vineyards, Joseph Phelps Vineyards, and gotten a lot of acclaim.  He was in the middle of a divorce and it was induced by this young man to buy the Oakville Grocery.  As I understood it, some of the thinking was in the divorce, if Solomon says cut the baby in half, he could give the wife the Oakville Grocery, the upscale fancy grocery, you know, and he would keep the vineyard and the winery.  He kept it all, but that’s beside the point.\n\tAnd I was hired in San Francisco, [for their new shop there] from this cheese shop.  I was looking for a job, and I was either going to become a salesman for a cheese distribution company or I was going to get this job.  There was this fellow named Phil Quattrogiochi.  I think he worked for Daryl Corti at the Corti Brothers in Sacramento, and he was offered the job at the Oakville Grocery, and I was offered the job selling cheese for this cheese company.  We said, “Nah,” and switched.  So he really didn’t want to be in retail, and I didn’t really want to be in wholesale.  I wanted to be on the stage of a shop, and he wanted to be in an office.\n\tHe went on to be a co-owner of San Francisco International Cheese Imports and later died of AIDS, and be a good friend, and I went on to do the Oakville Grocery.  I started out being the cheese guy, so I’d once again go up to the Oakville Grocery in Napa and learn about what they were doing there and be part of a team that was developing this new grocery.\n\tI have very vivid memories of pulling up to this building with a 1930s Coca-Cola sign painted on the entire side, thinking, “Hmm.  This is an important moment in my life.  This is a strong visual.  I will remember this for the rest of my life,” and I have, needless to say.  And I redid that store, much the same way as—except for one department.  It’s the way I did it.\n\nQ:  You redid it when you became more than the cheese guy?\n\nWolf:  No.  I redid it when they were paying me and I was the merchandising kid.  The guy who owned it knew about people.  His name was John Michaels.  He had bought it from Tom Maye, who had owned it and sold it to Joe Phelps.  He—I think I gave you the letter—was looking for—I mean, it’s so interesting that in all that time John turns out to have been a closeted gay man, married, with children.  I mean, there was all this subtext.  I mean, at that period of time in history, the homosexual subtext of food was extraordinary in certain sectors, not in all.  Certainly not in restaurant kitchens so much, but certainly in specialty foods.\n\nQ:  What else did the Oakville Grocery sell?\n\nWolf:  Well, there or in San Francisco?\n\nQ:  Where you were.\n\nWolf:  Well, I was coming once or twice or three times a week to the Oakville in the Napa Valley to prepare.  The San Francisco store, we rented an apartment at the top of Nob Hill near where I lived and we had people coming in to taste hundreds of olive oils and hundreds of mustards and hundreds of hams, and they were Alice Waters and Ruth Reichl and Jeremiah Tower and Joseph Phelps and Marion Cunningham and Catherine Brandel.  These people were the cream of the crop of the Bay Area, and the Bay Area is the cream of the crop of the country, quite frankly.  And I think James must have sat in from time to time, but I don’t remember that specifically.\n\tSo there was this coterie of really brilliant food professionals and cookery folk, and basically we were assembling their fantasy larder.  The thing about San Francisco is that it always had very fine groceries, but they were invisible because it was a hilly town and big trucks couldn’t get in.  So they were like little tiny groceries, corner groceries, that could get you anything and did, black truffles, fois gras, but you had to ask.\n\tSo this was a truly discretely sophisticated town.  This was the home of Williams-Sonoma, and those people knew about that, and I can tell you—I got to know Chuck Williams because I would spend Thanksgivings at Marion Cunningham’s and he was always there.  And I spoke with him and interviewed him for various things over the years.\n\tSo about a year later, I had been hired by the Oakville Grocery, and we were in the development period, and I was initially hired to do the cheese department.  I was always involved in the tastings, and two weeks before we opened, I was told to go to New York, take a look at Dean & Deluca, Balducci’s and Fairway and Zabar’s and come back and do a California original, because they knew I could merchandise.  And I had nine days, and the national press was coming.  What did I know?  So I made it up as I was going along.  And two weeks after we opened, I was doing all the buying and all the selling.  So in other words, I did all the ordering, and two months later, I was running the store.\nIt was very nerve-wracking for Joe because I was twenty-six, twenty-seven, he didn’t really know me, and I had no allegiance to him.  I was poor, Jewish, gay, you know.  Right?  And I scared him, and I found that out later.\n\tBut I was in love with this.  We did $17,000—no, I don’t remember what we did.  Maybe $17,000 one day on a short day on Christmas Eve the first year, and no wine, no liquor sales, no takeout.  We had four salads that we filled, platters that were filled from a two-burner plug-in.\n\nQ:  Who cooked?\n\nWolf:  This woman called Rick O’Connell, and I’ll tell you about her.  But the point is that we sold cheese.  For the first six months, 16 to 46 percent of the business was across the counter, because I knew how to do that.  I put on a show where, you know, I had the cheese boys and we had people who were sampling and tasting, and it was in the middle—we had amazing produce.  I would ask everybody about everything, and so the Häagen-Dazs frozen ice cream truck from the Natural Foods Company pulled up and I said, “What else you got back there?”\n\t“Well, we’ve got these farm chickens.”\n\t“What?”  We were selling free-range chickens in 1980, you know.  Brilliant cooks were saying to me, “Can you get capers and salt?”\n\tAnd I’d say, “I don’t know.  What characteristics should look for??”  And I’d get them because I didn’t know I couldn’t.\n\tI brought arugula all the way from Italy.  The first year it was $18 a pound.  The next year it was 89 cents a bunch.  You know, people would walk in and go, “Oh, weeds.  Well, you know, I can grow that.”\nWe had hand-gathered wild mushrooms because we discovered that there were all these organizations hand-gathering mushrooms, collecting them, vetting them, and sending them to western Germany—remember West Germany?—where they were boiled and put into cans and sent back for what James called the “gourmie” section of the grocery store, which was that little jobbed thing in the middle, sometimes there with the frozen stuff where mushrooms would sit there, Champignon or Chanterelles, and they’d collect dust, or for that one German lady who had to have them.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nWolf:  So it was extraordinary, and I was learning about thousands of things.  I had some rules, you know.  I made my own rules, but I got them from brilliant people.  If it has things on the label that I don’t understand, just don’t eat it.  Don’t even try it.  Don’t even worry about it.  Just no.\n\tAfter we opened, we had more than four thousand things in the store, and, again, this is stuff, individual, eight kinds of rice and a hundred mustards and sixteen, eighteen, twenty-two, thirty-two olive oils from different—and this is in 1980.\n\nQ:  How big was it?\n\nWolf:  Two thousand square feet.\n\nQ:  Oh, my. \n\nWolf:  And there was a wine shop in it, so we were only about sixteen thousand square feet.  It was extraordinary what we did.  And this produce section, I had this brilliant guy who did produce, but he would often not show up, because he was a brilliant guy who was crazy.  So I had to learn how to take care of everything, because otherwise, it would go bad.  So these had to be covered with a damp cloth, and these had to be left open, these had to be put in water.  I got this huge postgraduate course in food.\n\tPart of the cost of money is often somebody’s relative, and so Joe said to me, “You have to be nice to my daughter,” Leslie.  She was part of the cost of money.  She was the assistant manager.  This is a girl who would give me cocaine in the middle of the afternoon.  I would go to the bathroom, put it into a tissue, wrap it up, put it in my pocket, come out, run around, because cocaine and me, that’s kind of redundant, and then I’d give it back to her on her birthday, you know.  “Here, Leslie.”  “Oh, thank you.”\n\tThe tenth anniversary of Chez Panisse was held at Phelps Vineyards, and there was an oyster booth, and there was a grilled corn and sausage booth, and there was a crépinette booth, and there was an extra virgin olive oil and tomato booth.  This is in—must have been the early eighties.  Upstairs there was a cocaine booth.  I mean, you know, you went upstairs and there was Jeremiah Tower.  Anyway.\n\tSo Joe Phelps said to me at one point, “You know, you need to be a little bit easier with Leslie.  Sometimes she finds you intimidating.”  And he paused and he said, “In fact, sometimes so do I.”\n\tAll I thought to myself was, this is a billionaire, and I’m this funny little immigrant.  This food thing is kind of good, you know, because it’s the most important thing and people know it.\n\nQ:  Now, during this time, were you getting to know Jim Beard when he came to California for the classes?\n\nWolf:  What happened was I was in process of getting this shop opened, the Oakville, as part of the team, and I started seeing this young man, John Carroll, sort of dating.  John came to me one day and said, “I’m one of James Beard’s assistants, by the way, and he remembers meeting you in the cheese shop and would love it if you’d join us for dinner on Friday evening at the Stanford Court.”  James lived there half the year.  He learned and taught me early on that New Yorkers get tired of you, so you have to leave a lot.  And he said, “Now, don’t be insulted if he sends us home at 10:15 saying he’s tired.”\nAnd at quarter to one a.m., when John went to the bathroom and James and I were each sipping our second Glenlivet neat, the second in my life, he said, “Come around tomorrow and we’ll have a good gossip.”  You know, he knew a kindred spirit, I guess, fast and funny and silly and reasonably smart and all those things.  You know what I mean?\n\nQ:  So this is, what, maybe a year after you met him after he came into the cheese shop?\n\nWolf:  He probably came to the cheese shop in ’78, and this happened in ’79, because I think it was before we actually opened the Oakville Grocery.  Then he invited us to Christmas in New York, and, as you saw from those newsletters, when I came back the next year, for the next Christmas, I wrote about having been there.\n\nQ:  What did you two talk about when you were with him?\n\nWolf:  It seemed very normal.  He was a worldly man who had been all over the world.  He was a gay man who lived in Paris in the fifties.  That’s all I cared about.  You know, we didn’t talk about food that much.  We shared sensibility.  He asked me things.  What impressed me was at ’83, I brought—this is sometime later—a thirty-year-old Iranian Persian guy who I was working with who imported caviar.  We brought this caviar to Jim’s house.  We tasted all these caviars.  They were amazing.\n\tThe next day, I got a call from James Freaking Beard asking me to ask my young friend some questions.  You know, here he was, James Beard.  He remembered Tehran in the sixties, and he was describing the tile and the paint on the wall to the point where my friend was in tears, and he was asking questions.  So I thought this food thing is really cool.  It’s okay to ask questions and learn for all of your life.  You’re young for all of your life.  You’re never going to learn all of it.  It’s food.  It’s all of nature.  So I loved that he loved people.  I loved that he was conflicted, you know.  I also knew that I was never going to be the object of his affections.\n\nQ:  How did you know that?\n\nWolf:  We know these things.  Not his type.  And that clearly he was not my type.\n\tSo I was sleeping with John, who was this very handsome guy who everybody thought was gorgeous.  That was always a good idea.  And so James was a bit of a connoisseur and mostly visual when it came to good-looking guys, and he liked attractive young men around him.  Who doesn’t?  All the women I know feel the same way.  Most of the men I know, even straight men, it’s just having nice attractive young people, vital and with life.  But also James loved people in every age.  I would meet people at his doorstep.  He would call me—so we got to be friends a little bit.\n\nQ:  In California?\n\nWolf:  In California.  I came to a couple classes, blah, blah, blah.  But clearly I was an adult to him, as opposed to John, who was one of his minions, albeit gorgeous.  You know, he really did classify people in different ways.  I had a pretty—I liked my classification.  He acknowledged me nicely pretty early on.  I’m not sure why, maybe just because I knew about stuff that interested him.\n\nQ:  When you saw him, what kinds of events, for want of a better word, were they?\n\nWolf:  Well, in California, it was at a cooking class or a dinner, a table.  In New York, we came to visit him for the holidays, and we went to his house.\n\nQ:  You and John.\n\nWolf:  John Carroll and I.  I don’t remember where we stayed.  We did not stay with him.  He never had people over to stay.  But we had lunch and dinner and all those things.  It was me, John, James, his longtime upstairs miserable companion Gino Cofacci, and John Ferrone.  That’s it.\n\nQ:  This was before you moved here?\n\nWolf:  Yes.  And then after, the reason I moved is I was growing uncomfortable there.\n\nQ:  Because?\n\nWolf:  Well, I was becoming the star of the Oakville Grocery, and it was making Joe angry, because Joe liked to be the star of the world.  There was another guy who was running the wine department, who was a wine guy, and so they could get drunk together.\nWhat happened was Marian Burros came to California, and she was doing these pieces about California cuisine.  She’s the one who kind of wrote about it in the New York Times.  She’d just come to the New York Times not long before, from the Washington Post.  She called up and said, “I want to come to the Oakville Grocery and I want to talk to you about California foods and people and whatnot.”\n\tI said, “Great.  Come on Sunday at twelve-thirty.  We open at twelve.  Saturday’s our biggest day, so that will give me a chance to get cleaned up and be ready to speak with you.”\n\tShe arrived at eleven-thirty.\n\nQ:  [laughs] Oh, man.\n\nWolf:  I took her up to my desk, sat her down, gave her a cappuccino and a croissant, said, “I’ll come back to get you at twelve-thirty.”  I don’t know why.  It was just like I wasn’t intimidated.  I invited her into my store.  I was going to take time.  It wasn’t my store.  That was the other thing is that I really did treat it as not just somebody else’s, but a public trust.  It’s kind of how I feel about food in general, and I don’t mean that to be too grand, but it is a public trust, for god’s sakes.\n\tSo she came downstairs.  And Marian is now one of my best friends in the world.  She came downstairs and grabbed something, I don’t remember what, and said, “What do I want to do with this?”\n\tAnd believe me, what I said in my mind and what I said to her were not the same.  “You know, whatever you want, lady.”\nBut we got over to the produce department, and there was a big tub of fresh tofu.  Remember, wild mushrooms, fresh tofu.  Right?  It was barely the eighties from the seventies.  And Marian, who had always been very interested in healthy food things said, “Now, what do you do with tofu?”\nIt was such a food lady, food section, home-ec question, and I said, “Well, nothing in public.”  And she cracked up, and we became friends.\n\tSo a couple years later, she did the story, I mean, and the first part of the story came out, or the story came out in the Times.  Things that we had talked about were there.  People we talked about were there.  Ideas we had talked about were there.  No mentioned of me, no mention of the Oakville Grocery, nothing.  I thought, okay. \n\nQ:  This was about the California cuisine?\n\nWolf:  Yes.  I thought, okay, so that’s how that works.  Ouch.  All right, fine, whatever, you know.\n\tI was then asked to come to New York to go to Bloomingdale’s, because Bloomingdale’s in those days did these national promotions.  So they do a French promotion.  Everything in the store is French, the clothing and the dishware and—\n\nQ:  I remember.\n\nWolf:  And their food hall was all French too.\n\nQ:  You were supposed to do what?\n\nWolf:  I was supposed to come out representing the Oakville Grocery to possibly be part of a California promotion.\n\nQ:  Got it.\n\nWolf:  The problem was a couple of things.  Number one, Barbara Kafka wanted me to come to work for her.\n\nQ:  How did you know her?\n\nWolf:  Through James.  She was working in the classes, too.  I’d met her.  Marion Cunningham and Barbara were the senior helpers, and then there were all these other hangers-on.  Barbara didn’t want to call me because she did some consulting work for Joe, she did wine lists for Joe, and she put Joe’s stuff here and there.  So she didn’t want to call because it was a conflict, so she had James tell me.  By this point, I was talking to James on a regular basis on the phone.  He was a great phone guy, and I was a great phone—I love talking on the phone.\n\tSo I get a call and, “Hi, Barbara would love it if you’d come to New York.”  And he said, “And I’d love it if you were here too.  I’d really enjoy having you here.  I’d get to see you lots.”\n\tWell, that’s a no-brainer, so I decided I would come and see about this.  And I \nbring my stuff, and I get a call.  I’m here in New York.  I’ve gotten them to pay my way.  \nI have these specialty food products, California goat cheeses and some boxes and this, that, and the other.  And I get a call from Bloomingdale’s, “I’m terribly sorry, but tomorrow is the launch of our promotion for the Philippines.  Mrs. Marcos is going to be in the store, and there will be a demonstration on Third Avenue.  The security will be too tight.  You can’t come.”\n\tBarbara Kafka takes me to the Four Seasons for lunch, to the Grill Room.\n\nQ:  That was a good thing to do.\n\nWolf:  “There’s Henry Kissinger,” she said.  “There’s Arthur Schlesinger.  Wouldn’t you like to move to New York?\n\tAnd I said, “Would we be eating here a lot?”  [laughter].  What?  You know, what do you say?  Right?  I really did say that, and she was very nervous.\nAnyway, I didn’t know what to do, because I had had a falling-out with Joe and I really did want to leave and I really did want to come to New York and I wanted to accept this job, but I didn’t know what it was.  Clearly Barbara Kafka is wack.  She’s, I think, at heart probably a good person somewhere, and I think she wasn’t unkind to me, but she’s crazy and she was crazier then.\n\nQ:  What did she tell you you would be doing?\n\nWolf:  Oh, I was going to help her open and run Star-Spangled Foods, an all-American food store.  This is in 1982.  This is before its time, and she had things from all over the country, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and I was just bringing my expertise and some other things from California, blah, blah, blah.\n\t“But I don’t want you to run the store.  I want you to open the store and then run several.  We’ll have three, we’ll have six, we’ll have a chain across the country.  We’ll take over the world.  There’s Henry Kissinger.  There’s Arthur Schlesinger.”  So, you know, it’s like what am I going to do about this?\n\tThe next morning, the second part of Marian’s obvious two-part piece comes out in the New York Times in the Wednesday section, and I and the Oakville Grocery are about 30 percent of it.  And I get a call from Bloomingdale’s.  “We figured out how to have security.  Please join us.”  So I am twenty-nine years old.\n\nQ:  That’s fabulous.\n\nWolf:  And with my fluffy black curly hair, and I’m first-generation American, grown up in the Valley, I mean, you know, in the middle of nowhere.  Now I had gone back, as I said, and learned a little bit about my mother’s mother’s family because I wanted a little grand credibility, for me, just to get through the afternoon, just to make me feel like I wasn’t a piece of total garbage, or nothing, that I was not hopeless.  I really did feel that way, that if you dig into your past, you’re going to find upsetting things and you’re going to find hopeful—things that give you hope.  I decided that I was going to lean on the stuff that gave me hope and a place in the world.\n\nQ:  Do you mean not feel hopeless or not feel like a country bumpkin or what?\n\nWolf:  Well, both.  Not feel worthless and not feel—\n\nQ:  Unsophisticated?\n\nWolf:  Yeah, that.  Not have any genetic connection to success.  My father sold hardware.  His name was Izzy, for god’s sakes, you know.  My mother’s name had been Devora Barenstein, and she became Delly Wolf.  I mean, can I breathe here?  Do I have a place here?  Do I have a voice, you know, somehow?\n\tI used to read a lot of books and kind of live in the literature, but this was real.  So suddenly I’m in Bloomingdale’s, and I have my VP Purchasing and my security guy, and over there is Imelda Freaking Marcos with puffy starched sleeves and her VP and her security guy, and she’s looking at me like, “Who the heck is that?”  What?\n\tSo I didn’t say anything to Barbara.  I just did the thing, came back to California.  I borrowed a woman’s house in the Napa Valley and took my then boyfriend, which was another guy named John, and we swam in the sunshine and I spent a day and I went in and said, “I’m leaving.”  In six weeks, I sold everything on the street, some of which was—\n\nQ:  Your personal things?\n\nWolf:  Yes, some of which was like pretty good arts and crafts wicker.  Damn.  And moved to New York.  James fed me about once a week, once every other week, Saturday or Sunday, oftentimes until a point where Gino would say, “He has to go.  He has to go,” because they wanted to listen to opera on the radio.  And sometimes James would say, “Oh, go listen upstairs.  We’re still talking.”\nI spoke to him every morning.  I opened her store.  It turns out I brought most of the products for the whole store.  It turns out the thing was kind of scam.\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nWolf:  She didn’t have the stuff.  She said she needed me or she couldn’t have done the store without getting me.  She would not have done the store.  I had the Rolodex of life.\n\nQ:  I see.  She didn’t have the product or the connections to get it?\n\nWolf:  Exactly.  It was kind of smoke and mirrors.  Her father was dying.  Her mother, one of the meanest people I’ve ever met.  She was overspending and breaking every rule.  She didn’t have the money.  She didn’t raise the money to do it.  So she lied about most of it to me, and it was a very difficult year, because she had painted the store the colors of Giverny, which, you know, is not exactly the best way to have an American food store.  She didn’t want to—she’s an obscurest.  And while there might be an interesting intellectual connection, that’s not how people buy or experience food.\n\nQ:  Wait a minute.  In terms of the color, you meant it wasn’t red, white, and blue, it was—\n\nWolf:  It was the colors of Giverny.  It was that pinky blue and—\n\nQ:  With that same subtle—\n\nWolf:  —yellow, none of which are good food colors.  She decided that if she’d made the shelves eighteen inches deep, she wouldn’t need storage downstairs, because she didn’t have any.  Well, the reason shelves are shallow is because that way they always look full.  She didn’t bother to learn anything.  She didn’t have any respect for any history.  It was only about her, and she actually did sit in the window at her own typewriter, typing, writing her column for Vogue.  She was being a Vogue-ette—she was then the food editor of Vogue—in her own shop.  She was being clever, but she was being clever about food, which doesn’t work.\n\nQ:  What was the idea behind the store, though?\n\nWolf:  That it would be the first food store that had only American foods.  She would do the first international store that brought food [only from America].  The problem was she wanted everything categorized by state.  What was interesting was it was all about her, not about the people buying the food.  And you can do that with perfume and fashion to some degree, but only to some degree.  But with food, it’s absolutely not about you; it’s about everyone else.\n\tSo, in fact, a lot of struggles.  She introduced me around to really some very interesting people, some heinous people.  The first day I went to meet her, besides the fact we went into her basement that was very small and very stuffy and she farted a lot and thought that was okay, that was my introduction.  I thought where is Henry Kissinger and Arthur Schlesinger when we need them?\n\tThis woman called Paula Wolfert was working with her, for her, and Paula said, “Do you want to share a cab?”\n\tAnd I said, “Sure.”  We were both going, I don’t know, uptown or downtown, probably downtown because Barbara lived on 92nd Street, still does.\n\tAnd the first things out of Paula Wolfert’s mouth were horrible things about Barbara.  She basically wanted to gossip about what a horrible person Barbara Kafka is.  And I said, “Excuse me.  She just brought me to New York, and we’re not going to have this conversation.”\n\tWhen I was on the phone with Barbara, she was on the phone with Stephen Spector.  Stephen was another of Jim Beard’s friends, and a very important person.  He changed American food in restaurants, actually.  He had a restaurant called Le Plaisir for two years.  It was the first real place where food people got together in a restaurant and talked about the food, and later on it became an American place for Larry Forgione.\n\tAnd Barbara said something horrible and catty, because basically she was homophobic in a way that people love fags, you know what I mean, very fashionista.  And she said something horrible about a third person and handed me the phone and said, “Here’s Stephen.”\n\tAnd Stephen Spector, bless his heart, said to me, “This is not how you want to meet me, is it?”\n\tI said, “No.”\n\tHe said, because James had said I was a nice young man, I guess, or something, “Meet me tonight at Cherche Midi.  I’m having dinner there.  Meet me later in my dinner and we’ll have a cup of coffee, tea, and go for a walk.”\n\tSo Stephen Spector, after that, took me on a walk in Central Park—this is 1982—with his six champion terriers, told me the story of New York, and became my friend, you know, really was very generous and dear.\n\nQ:  He was approximately how old?\n\nWolf:  I have no idea.  Maybe in his fifties.\n\nQ:  But a lot older than you.\n\nWolf:  Yes.  Maybe in his fifties.  He was the partner of Peter Josten.  He used to refer to himself as the last of the Lehman Ladies, because Peter Josten was of the Lehman family.  And Stephen Spector had an apartment on Fifth Avenue at 880.  It was the penthouse just below the Frick.\n\tWhen I left Barbara a year later, and what I did with Barbara was I finally—at one point we were fighting about this, that, and the other, and I said, “Barbara, you’ve got to get some more money.  You’ve got to get money by October 31st or I’m closing the door because—.” \n\tShe got the money from her mother.  “But it will cost me.”\n\tI said, “You mean emotionally?  Who cares.”  You know what I mean.\n\tAnd she would buy a new bauble at Bulgari and not pay for it, but then we didn’t have money to pay the jam lady or Milton Glaser, who did a bad job.\nAnyway. we’re walking and we’re discussing all this.  Finally she says to me, “So, but how are you otherwise?”\n\tI said, “What do you mean?”\n\tShe said, “Well, you know, how’s your personal [life]?”\n\tI said, “Barbara, I moved all the way across the country to find out everything you told me wasn’t true.  That’s as personal as I’m getting with you.  My professional life, that is my personal life.”\n\nQ:  What did she say?\n\nWolf:  Nothing.  I mean, no one had ever talked back to Barbara before, you know.  They were all afraid of her.  Everybody was afraid of her.  And it was like, “Barbara, you’re full of shit,” you know what I mean?  You know what a tomato is, and aren’t you excited?  You know it because you went on vacation to the Amalfi coast.  I went because they grew in my backyard.  Next.\n\tIt was a very interesting time because what I realized when I got to New York was that what I knew more than a lot of other people, what James knew, was what things tasted like.  We came from the West where things grew, and we came to New York and could identify and were much less dependent at that time on European travels.  We had a healthy sensibility about the French sensibility.  I mean, I went to Berkeley.  I knew what France was.  I knew what a croissant was.\n\tAt that point I will admit that after I worked at the cheese shop and before I started the Oakville Grocery, I took the only vacation of my life that was a month long and I went to Europe, and I was post the age of being able to sleep on the floor, so I went to cheap hotels in pension and I went to Paris for a total of nine days at different times, London, Paris, Surrey, Brussels.  I took the overnight train that went through many different borders to Berlin, to what was then West Berlin, Milan, Florence.  You know, I went many, many places because I needed to find out what the fuck this was all about.\n\nQ:  This was before you actually moved?\n\nWolf:  No, this was before I worked for Oakville Grocery.\n\nQ:  Oh, oh, oh.\n\nWolf:  It was after the cheese shop before the Oakville Grocery, because I needed to go to Pek in Milan, and I needed to go Fauchon in Paris, before I opened the thing up.  I couldn’t be overly impressed by Balducci’s.  I needed to know what Milan looked like, what the street flow—I went and I was ravenous.  I was a gay man in his twenties who didn’t hook up with any other men until the last night before I was leaving, and I was so broke by that time that this boy and I sat and had deux Beeg Mac and deux maxi frites and deux Coca-Colas at the McDonald’s on the Champs d’Elysées, which they later closed.  I mean, you know, I was really starved for culture and flavor and texture and context and experience in life.\n\tAnd James had it all the time.  He would call me up.  See, that was the other thing that, in retrospect, was so enriching.  He would call me up and say, “The ambassador from Spain is coming, and I’m tired.”\n\tAnd I’d say, “I’ll be right there,” and I would go over and sit on the floor in my little jeans and t-shirt, and he and the ambassador would talk, and then he’d fall asleep and I’d talk to the ambassador.  Because I really basically like talking to everyone, and I do believe that if you really—one of the things I loved about the language of food is that there isn’t anyone you can’t speak with.  When I went to Italy, I didn’t speak a word of Italian.  I was in the Formaggio Peck cheese shop [in Milan].  I talked to a guy across the counter.  He didn’t speak a word of English, I didn’t speak a word of Italian, we spoke for twenty-five minutes and cried three times.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nWolf:  Because you can speak because it is the most important thing.  It is the great universal.  I remember being told later that Mrs. Getty was so pleased by the way I was so natural with her.  I didn’t know who she was.  She was a pretty lady who spent two grand.  I liked her.  You know what I mean?  It didn’t matter, and it still doesn’t matter.  I’m not impressed by titles.  I’m impressed by the heart and soul and reality of a person.  Do you know what I mean?  In that way, I guess, I’m egalitarian and truly Jewish.  We’re nomadic.  I just like good people wherever I go.  I don’t know what that is.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tWolf - 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Clark Wolf\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #2\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t           New York City\n\nDate:  July 7, 2009\n\nQ:  It is July 7, 2009.  It’s Judith Weinraub.  I’m here with Clark Wolf for his second interview.\nIt’s nice to see you.  Good afternoon.\n\nWolf:  Wonderful to see you here too.  It’s also particularly nice to be sitting on what must have been Gus Schumacher’s family farm.\n[Wolf is referring to the land beneath the 72nd St. building in NYC where the interview is taking place, and near the original Schumacher farm.]\n\nWeinraub:  [laughs]  Definitely.  I thought, since we’ve gotten you to New York and to Star Spangled Foods, that it occurred to me, when looking at the timing of everything, that you seem to have become a consultant pretty soon in that time frame, so I thought you could tell me how that happened, how you worked for Star Spangled Foods and how all of that developed.\n\nWolf:  It actually is an interesting story, even if it weren’t mine, because this is how some things happen, and it also happened to be, as a number of other pieces of my particular personal and professional history, matched a certain cultural revolution.  I had been one of those people that has kind of been floating along the cultural tide.  I knew where I was and I did paddle a bit, but that’s really what happened.\n\tWhen I came to New York, I was brought here by Barbara Kafka, but I came because of James Beard.  He said, “It would be fun if you were here,” and he fed me once every week, once every other week for the first year or so that I lived here, on Saturday or Sunday.  And let me tell you, a good thing too.  Poor as a church mouse, awed and amazed by everything, having been taken by Barbara Kafka to the Grill Room at the Four Seasons and to see—I think I told you—Henry Kissinger and Arthur Schlesinger, which are fun to say together but not always easy to get together at luncheon table, and realizing that a baked potato was $12,000, but that New York was broad and rich and deep and complex.\n\nWeinraub:  Did you talk to James about that or did he talk to you about that at all?\n\nWolf:  About?\n\nWeinraub:  The complexities of what you were—\n\nWolf:  Oh, completely.  I mean, basically he said, “It would be fun to have you here.”  We did speak about people more than about food.  We spoke about people.  We spoke about things.  I think he embodied more than he knew.  He was a gay man who lived in Paris in the fifties.  Excuse me; that’s interesting.  Having twenty minutes with him was more interesting than most things in New York.  Watching him be in New York and, unless he’d been away for a while, go unnoticed and unattended to, taught me all about how one of the important things in New York is that you come and go.  If you’re an absolute total full-time local, New Yorkers ignore you as a public voice.  I learned so much from his richness of life.\nThe other thing is that I knew a lot of food people, but they were so compartmentalized.  San Francisco is a place where food is an obsession and a fetish in a lot of ways, or it’s a connector to your original cultural heritage.  San Francisco is not a very integrated community.  All Ligurians stick together.  All the Hong Kongs stick together.  You know, a lot of these things, which is why you taste it in a pure form, but it’s also why it can be insular.  I couldn’t stand San Francisco because everybody that I was able to be anywhere near was white, and if they weren’t Waspy, they were Jews trying to be Waspy.  You could know somebody thirty years and not know that both their parents were Jewish, because they really worked at it, you know.  When I lived in San Francisco and somebody said, “What do you do?” they meant sexually and in terms of mind-altering assistance.\n\nWeinraub:  Drugs.\n\nWolf:  Yes.  And when they say, “Where are you from?” they meant it emotionally or psychically or spiritually.  In New York, suddenly I was a first-generation American Romanian Jew, and it was wonderful, different, no more complete in its identification than anything else, but it was just such an extraordinary perspective.\nSo I would visit him, and what I found him to be is more complex and more complete as a human being.  I spent time with a lot of other luminaries.  I knew Julia Child and enjoyed her very much, but she wasn’t an intellectual by any means.  She was socially successful, from a socially successful background, whatever that means, and nice and liberal, but James was truly interesting and truly brilliant and had a great range and a great depth of knowledge, understanding, interest, and it wasn’t superficial and it wasn’t competitive.  It was truly the man.  So I learned about faience, about Majolica.  I learned about the theater.  I learned about opera.  I mean, this man was interested in a lot of different things, and he helped me have it be okay for me to be truly interested in that which truly interested me.  Not a very good sentence, but you know what I mean.\n\nWeinraub:  Did he talk about his own sexuality at all in any way?\n\nWolf:  Oh, of course.  Oh, of course.  I remember he once said to me, “I’m so glad that we’re not attracted to each other.  It makes it so much easier to talk.”  And I never really knew if that was exploratory or a statement, but I didn’t really care.  I took it at face value and said, “Right.”  And we talked a lot about—he was very attracted to somebody I was sleeping with, to John Carroll, and John Carroll is a very handsome man still, the bastard, and was gorgeous then, you know.  I found John very good-looking and so deeply unappealing.  I mean, I love him, but not in that either romantic or sexual, physical way.  But it was interesting to go to parties with John to Bob Coacello’s apartment.  I could go anywhere if I had John on my arm, because he was kind of halting in his speech, so other people could do all the talking, and in NY, powerful people like that.  And he was very good-looking, so it made people feel more attractive.  It was like he was good jewelry.\n\nWeinraub:  Tell me what he did.\n\nWolf:  John actually was one of Jim’s West Coast assistants.  He’s written a number of books.  He lives in San Francisco, and he helped Marion Cunningham with a couple of the Fannie Farmer books.  He’s a very dear man who also makes great pies, amazing muffins.  He’s from Watsonsville; he’s a small-town guy.  His name is John and he’s married to another man named John, and they live in San Francisco and he works three days a week as a customer service manager at Safeway.  He’s a very dear guy.\n\tAnyway, James loved to talk about everything and everyone, and we analyzed and dissected, and it was gossip, but gossip in a fairly constructive way.  It was bitchy at times, but never mean-spirited, and it was really, in my sense, always out of a desire to learn and to know and to understand better.  And that’s my nature as well, so I loved it.\n\tI remember bringing a thirty-year-old Persian—I called him that; he was from Iran—Iranian guy who was an importer of caviar and who I was working with, and I’ll tell that story in a minute.  We run into James, and we had tasted all this different stuff.  I got to bring him to James freakin’ Beard, right?\n\tThe next day, James Beard calls me up and says, “Could you ask your young friend this and this and this?”  Now, this is James Beard who, the day before, could remember the paint on the tile in a hotel in Tehran in the sixties, to the point where my friend was in tears.  And the next day he called up to ask questions, because he was—\n\nWeinraub:  About the caviar?\n\nWolf:  About the caviar.  He wasn’t done learning.  One of the reasons I like Jeremiah Tower, because when all is said and done, he was always very supportive of the reality that we always continue to learn.\nSo, being around him helped me pick or settle on a comfort with my future.  I always felt that I would begin the adult part of my professional and personal career in life in my fifties, which is what’s happened, because food was one of those things where you can’t possibly know enough before the age of fifty to be any use at all.  You can show some talent and some ability, and you show early developed skill sets that you lose later in life, but to actually be of value in something that I find to be fundamentally critical, very important and powerful, you need some time.  So I loved seeing that.\n\nWeinraub:  How much older was James than you?\n\nWolf:  I moved here when I was twenty-nine and he was at the end of his seventies, the beginning of his eighties.  He died in ’85 at eighty-three?  Is that right?  Something like that.  And I came in ’82.  Three, four, five, right?  So he was in his eighties, but I knew him in his late seventies, I guess, in San Francisco.  So it was at the end of his life.\n\tI’ll never forget the first time I went to his house and I thought, “I’m going to James Beard’s house.  I wonder what we’ll be nibbling on.”  You know, thinking caviar, foie gras, an entire roasted suckling pig, just sitting around.  And I said, “I’m starving.  Is there anything?”\n\tHe said, “Sure.  There’s some Skippy peanut butter in the fridge,” you know.  “Calm down.”\n\tAnyway, I move to New York, I work for Barbara.  James fed me a little bit.  I went some places, I did some things, so I had that wonderful first season of a young man from someplace else, in their late twenties, who is polite and good at conversation, and had a blue blazer and decent slacks, and I just accepted every invitation.  I did all those things that I was told to do, and it was lovely.  It was wonderful.  Saw Mrs. Kennedy twice in the first two months.  You know, like that.\n\nWeinraub:  How did you get those invitations?\n\nWolf:  Through the good offices of nice people.  All my friends were in their seventies or older.  So James invited me to—well, historically it’s interesting.  His assistant at the time was a woman called Emily Gilder.  She was married to Harwood Gilder.  They had lived in an apartment on Washington Square Park over those—and I quote—“damn liberals,” the Roosevelts.  She gave parties.  She was his assistant.  She lived next door.  She gave a party.  I was sleeping on a couch and then on a floor, borrowing an apartment for five days, and a woman called Mary something, who lived in Allentown, Pennsylvania, had a pied-à-terre at Tudor City.  All these things that are fun to say— pied-à-terre at Tudor City.  So she gave it to me for a month.  I mean, it was like that.  “Here’s our young friend from California.  Let’s help him.”  So all these wonderful old birds, men and women, they were birds.  They were wonderful old peacocks and doves.  Emily always made her famous turkey tetrazzini.  Such frightening food.  So I was welcomed into a lot of different circles.\n\nWeinraub:  Meanwhile, continuing to work for Barbara or with Barbara?\n\nWolf:  For Barbara, against Barbara, whatever.  To cut to after I finished working with Barbara, I had made contact with a lot of people, because I was across the counter and everybody came in.  Barbara was very well known and visible in those days.  She was the food editor of Vogue.  The Oakville Grocery was a big deal.  I was a big deal, in a way, as a manifestation but also I was funny and charming and young and I had black curly hair and all that stuff, lots of energy.  So people were really wonderful to me.\nI behaved well in the demise of Barbara’s business, and I really did, for its own sake.  I kept my counsel, because it wasn’t my story to tell.  How you behave in tough situations is really powerful, and so I pushed and pushed and pushed.  I did a spring cleaning sale, really convincing people that it was just to clean out the stock and redo for the summer season.  Paid off all the bills of all the little food makers, leaving, of course, Milton Glaser and Barbara’s mother in the lurch, and closed the store.\nI had been with Arthur Schwartz of the Daily News the day before, and I let Barbara tell it, because it was not my business.  I didn’t want to be insidery gossip; I wanted to be a mensch.  I wanted to be a grown-up.  And that happened, and I did it because it was the right thing to do, not because I had calculated.\n\nWeinraub:  What did happen, in fact.  It failed because—\n\nWolf:  She never had enough money or enough product or anything, because she broke every rule in the book; because she was completely distracted; because she made it nearly impossible; because she barely had half of what she needed to make it work in terms of capital; because she was constantly chasing her own tail and making things worse; because she had a window that she wanted to sit in; because she had an American food store painted the colors of Giverny.  If that doesn’t tell you everything.  Because she was an oxymoron and it was her intention to be interesting and contrary, which is really great at a cocktail party and really bad for a business that’s based in the deepest set of cultural norms there are.  Is.  Are.\n\nWeinraub:  You mean eating.\n\nWolf:  Food.  Not eating; food.  Much more powerful than just eating.  Unless you’re absolutely brilliant, you can see permutations, you can discuss them, but you can’t do them and expect to survive.  She was doing an art piece and I was doing a shop.  So what I did was, I threw her out.  She was capricious, and you can’t be when you deal with a business that is on pennies and nickels and dimes.  She couldn’t get good storage, so she made the shelves eighteen inches deep so that she could store things right there.  Well, you don’t do that.  You don’t have eighteen-inch-deep shelves that always look empty, that are made out of wood, that are going to buckle.\nAnyway, basically what I did was I threw her out of the store.  I said, “If you don’t leave right now, give me $80,000 for the stock.  If you don’t leave right now, I will leave and lock the door and tell everybody everything.  Go away.”  So I threw her out.  I re-merchanized the store the way I knew it had to be.\n\nWeinraub:  You got the $80,000?\n\nWolf:  I did.  That was another conversation.  We were walking up the street and we’re talking about all this stuff and what’s going on.  She said, “How are things personally?”\n\tI said, “I came across the country, all the way across the country to do a business that’s seminal, and none of what you’ve told me is true, and you don’t have any of the money or the resources, and you’re constantly being difficult.  That’s personal.  That’s all I’m going to talk to you about.”  And so she gave me the money, and I said, “And we have to have it by such and such.”\n\tAnyway, I re-merchandized the store the way people actually shop in a store in America, in a food shop, and of course sales jumped instantly.\n\nWeinraub:  What did that involve?  What kind of things did you put in that weren’t there?\n\nWolf:  That’s not the issue.  I put all the jams together.  I didn’t separate everything by state.  It wasn’t a library; it was a shop.\n\nWeinraub:  I see.  I see.\n\nWolf:  I put all the things by category the way we do this.  Actually, that was a precursor for my being a consultant, because what I discovered was I know what I know.  And I had been through a cheese shop that went Chapter 11 that I helped make survive.  I knew how a business worked.  She didn’t.  She knew how to get money from her mother.  She knew how to ask her husband for a new piece of jewelry.  She had no idea.\nSo what I realized is that food was compelling, it was becoming very popular, and I actually did understand how it worked, or I understood what I knew and I understood the basics of business.  So for about a year I did tastings and seminars and got to do some articles.  People were nice to me.  They gave me assignments.  I was very concerned about—I wrote a little bit for Pat Brown, for Cuisine, for Cooks Magazine, and I was very concerned—I didn’t want to be a writer or a journalist, even though I thought that way and I had some training.  I wanted to have more possibilities and more options.  I didn’t have a rich husband or wife or trust fund, and I didn’t find writing financially viable.  And having come from San Francisco, where every third person in the Bay Area was a food writer, mostly because they were married to somebody with money or had their own, I didn’t pretend that I could afford to do that, and I realized that if I kept writing, I would be taking the rent, the food, the bread out of writers’ mouths, at the very least taking their opportunities, and that they would hate me and they would be right.  So I was careful not to do that.\nScratching around to figure out what to do, I was doing little projects and this, that, and the other, and in 1985 I got a call from a man named Joe Santo, Dr. Joseph Santo.  John Mariani, who was writing about American food all over the country, and he had been speaking, and Joe wanted to take what had been a failed Tyrolean restaurant on the Upper East Side, on East 60th Street around the corner from Bloomingdale’s, and he had said, “If it doesn’t work as a ski resort-type thing, it’ll work as a southwestern thing, because it’s all wood and stone,” and he’d always wanted to do a restaurant based on that wonderful magazine, Arizona Highways, that had been part of his fantasy life.  Joe asked Mariani, “Do you know anybody who can help me?  Because I have no idea what this means.”\nAnd Mariani said, “Yeah, Clark Wolf.  He knows what the food is and he knows where the stuff is and how to do it.”\nSo he hired me to do Arizona 206 for $10,000 total, and actually, I wrote the menu every single day for six months, by hand; it’s my handwriting.  And actually the typeface that worked eventually was computerized, based on my handwriting.  I did the logo with my cheese shop “for the price of cheddar” marking pen writing, but I did it with a double marking pen orange with yellow over and said, “Let’s color-Xerox this,” because in ’85, color Xerox was new.  I said, “Let’s just take this to a graphic artist and have them do it.”\nAnd he said, “Screw that.  I paid you.  We’ll use this.”  So suddenly my handwriting from my cheese shop was on the awning of a New York restaurant and in a full-page ad in Interview magazine.  It was extraordinary how common sense and fresh eyes can achieve great things or big things or visible things or a viable thing.\nSo what happened was—and I was terrified to do this.  I was having some help from a young man who was working a little bit, my first assistant, a man called Charles Thompson.  He had been one of the kids in my cheese department in the Oakville Grocery in San Francisco, and he’d also been Jeremiah Tower’s boyfriend.  So, for example, when Jeremiah would come to town, Charles would have me pick the places.  Jeremiah would bring a limousine, champagne, and the cocaine, and Clark would design the evening.  We’d go all over New York City to look at the hottest, best blah, blah, blah.  It was hilarious.\nSo I said, “He wants me to do this restaurant.  I’m a food shopper.  I know food and I know restaurants, but I’ve never—.”\nAnd Charles said, “Jeremiah gets $50,000 a restaurant.  He doesn’t know anything.”\n\nWeinraub:  You mean for setting up a restaurant.\n\nWolf:  Yes.  “He knows nothing.  He doesn’t know how to run a business.  He doesn’t know how to set up the phone.”\n\tSo I said, “Okay, I’ll try.”\n\nWeinraub:  Had you left Star Spangled Foods?\n\nWolf:  Yes.  This is ’85.  So between ’82 and ’83 I did Star Spangled Foods.  Between ’83 and ’84, ‘85ish, I was doing seminars and projects, going all over the country and giving talks for Foods & Wine of France, Foods of Spain, whatnot, because I was helping to teach American chefs and culinary teachers.  I remember flying up to Rhode Island to Johnson & Wales in a little puddle jumper that I would not take now, to the point that I couldn’t hear when I got off.  There were fifty chef teachers.  This was their fourth weekly program of on their day off, come in for a seminar.  The other three were lousy, and if this wasn’t good, they were never coming again.  There would be open revolt.  Well, we had a great time.  I learned how to communicate with people who know what I know, who know what I don’t know, and who don’t know what I know.  So it was a training ground.\n\tI did a French cheese-tasting seminar for the Balducci family [upstairs next to the original store].  No, wait a second.  At seven-thirty at night on Sunday.  Can I just tell you, if it hadn’t been useful, they would have put me into the pâté there.  The first thing I did was I set up a table that looked like it could have been one of their cases, so they were impressed by my actual retail ability.  Then I asked them a question and they had the wrong answer, so I said, “Okay.  Do you trust me?  I know a little something and I’m here to help.”  I gave them several ideas.  They made money right away, like if you put farm eggs into a big glass jar of rice in which you also have truffles, you will be able to sell the eggs for a lot of money.  They’d never heard of that.  Remember, I had been spending two and a half years learning from the best chefs in the world.  The Oakville Grocery, I mean, everyone from Elizabeth David to Alice Waters, to Roger Verge, I mean people from all over the world would come and tell us things.  Diane Kennedy.  These were brilliant, brilliant people. \nMarcella Hazan.  I’ll never forget, at the home of Lonnie Kuhn in Pacific Heights in San Francisco, Marcella was giving a class to a bunch of rich women, quite frankly, and two really confused men, but anyway, I walked in just as a visitor to the class, to observe, and she shoved them out of the way to show me and have me taste 100-year-old balsamic vinegar out of her hand, because I was symbolic.  I was hungry.  I was a sponge.  I still kind of am.  But I was this young, hungry collaborator, and that’s really what it was, it was collaboration.  I wasn’t ever going to compete with them and they knew it.\n\nWeinraub:  But your confidence level must have been growing a little bit.\n\nWolf:  You think?  [laughs]  Well, what happened was, when I was working at the Oakville Grocery, Joseph Phelps from Hensel Phelps Construction—we talked about this.  I think I said that the last time I was with you, said to me, because his daughter was working for me, because that’s one of the costs of money, “You need to be a little bit easier with her.  You’re sometimes intimidating to her.  Sometimes you’re intimidating to me.”\nWell, food knowledge is so powerful, that if you have a little bit of it, it’s huge, and I actually had a lot of it because I hadn’t grown up with a mother who was a good cook, but I did grow up with a very intelligent, creative mother, and there were fruit trees, you know, and my grandmother could cook and all those other things.  So, yeah, I had a lot of confidence.  Certain things you know, and when you’re selling something for $150 a pound, you need to at least speak with confidence, with authority, right?  That’s my Mary Martin story.\n\nWeinraub:  I don’t know about that.\n\nWolf:  Mary Martin walked into the Oakville Grocery and said, “Hi.  Are you Clark?”\n\t“Yes.”\n\t“My friend told me about you.  I’m Mary Martin.”\n\tI said, “I know, Miss Martin.  Nice to meet you.”  It’s Mary Martin!\n\tShe said, “My friend says that you have really good truffles.”  So I took her over and I sold her about $95 worth of Perigord black truffles.\n\tI get a phone call the next day.  “Hello.  Is this Clark?”\n\t“Yes.”\n\t“This is Mary Martin.  Do you remember me?”\n\t“Yes, Miss Martin.  Of course.”  I said, “How are those truffles?”\n\tShe said, “Well, they were wonderful, but my friend had meant the $1.25 chocolate ones, but I did have the best roast turkey in my life.”  Isn’t that wonderful?\n\nWeinraub:  [laughs] That’s a great story.\n\nWolf:  Right?  And sometime later, Larry Hagman walked in, drinking champagne in the store, and said—\n\nWeinraub:  “My mother sent me.”  [laughs]\n\nWolf:  “Walk me around, but be careful, my ma says you’re dangerous,” or something like that.  It was amazing!\n\tBut anyway, so, yeah, it was extraordinary.  You could meet anybody in the right context in a service position, right?  But what I learned early on is that what I had that was useful and what I learned in NY was, if you would like to have some influence [unclear] a place, be useful, offer something.  So I offered what I knew, and that’s what I did. \n\tSo I did Arizona 206.  It was a hit because I understood the strategy of business development and of personal development, because I was in the midst of the experience for myself, and always have been.  I’m first-generation.  I’m just starting out.  So just starting out is who I am.  So I kept pushing Joe Santo and asking him, “Why are you doing this?  What’s your goal?”\n\t“Well, my goal is to be successful.”\n\t“No, no, no.  What’s your goal?”\n\t“My goal is to have Sign of the Dove stop hemorrhaging so much money.”\n\t“No.  What’s your goal?”\n\tUltimately what I discovered was his goal was to take the Sign of the Dove, which had been called by Zagat and other reviewers “the black spider, the restaurant that New Yorkers love to hate”—extraordinary—and make it viable again and redo Yellowfingers, which he also owned, and make all the properties successful, sufficient, so that some day at the top of a real estate cycle he could sell all of it, retire, pay off everything, and take care of his family.  So once I knew the short, medium, and long-term goal, I knew what to do.\n\tSo once we opened Arizona 206, I said to him, “How do we make money?”  Because we made $1000 the first year in fifty two seats.  That’s nearly impossible.  That’s good, but that’s no way to do a business.  So he then took over the shoe store next door, in a building which he owned, actually, to make a café that was more casual and you could go there more times.  I had the experience of learning how to build a strategy with a very talented, alchemistic businessperson who was kind of crazy, and he was.  He was very emotional, very visceral, very artistic, very self-indulgent, you know, kind of crazy and wonderful, and I would never call him Dr. Santo because he was an oral surgeon who didn’t practice.  If he wasn’t Joe to me, I couldn’t work with him.\nI did the Sign of the Dove, and I’m working on that and I said, “You know, you have to make this real.  This had been opened as a bar in the sixties while you were getting your practice going, and it was such a hit and it became this basically clip joint, where you charge way too much for what it was, and for a long time it worked and then ultimately it bit you in the butt.”\n\nWeinraub:  And he was responsive to your suggestions?\n\nWolf:  That’s a broad way of putting it.  I was funny, I was smart, I was crazy, I was intense.  At one point I said, “I think you need to leave the restaurant.  You’ll still run the company, but you need to go to the corner at Arizona 206 and let your brother and sister-in-law be the new face of this restaurant.”\nAnd he almost hit me.  He said, “You’re firing me from my own business.”  He said, “I can’t believe you’re throwing me out of—.”\nI said, “Joe, you’ve tried everything else for four years.  I’m telling you what will work.  Give it a shot.”\nHe did, and it worked.  My favorite was Jane Freiman at Newsday wrote, “It’s as if somebody opened a window and the rococo escaped.”\nWhat I did was, I began to, because I had the mind of a writer to some degree, and because I understand the realities, I began to try to imagine and describe what it is I wished people would think about this restaurant, whoever they were.  What will the locals think?  What will the regulars think?  What will the writers think?  What will the out-of-towners think?  And putting myself in all those positions, because, again, I’m nomadic, I’m first-generation.  And I was, in many cases, able to lean into what we used to say, the kind of review you want your mom to write.  It is a collection of skill sets.\n\nWeinraub:  Yes, it is.\n\nWolf:  It really is.  So that’s what I started doing in the two and a half, three years, I don’t remember.  We redid Arizona 206.  I mean we did Arizona 206, we did the café.  We redid Yellowfingers, and I brought Judy Rogers, who is now at the Zuni Café, and I sat them down and I said, “You have three choices.  Improve this as it is, make it a Cal-Italian hybrid,” which in those days was a term I mostly started, “or go all the way and really reconceive it as a new version of what it’s been.”\n\nWeinraub:  This was Yellowfingers?\n\nWolf:  Yellowfingers.\n\nWeinraub:  Was she in California?\n\nWolf:  She was here.  She came here.  She was out of the Boonville Hotel [in California], maybe.  She had been working with Marion Cunningham as an advisor in the kitchen. She was an Alice Waters groupie and quite strange and self-involved and self-important and intense and wonderful.  She came and really intimidated all of the African immigrants who were downstairs doing all the hard work.  She was scarier than they were, and she probably still is.  But anyway, she was very good.\n\tAnyway, the result was, they went all the way.  They redid it and it was called Yellowfingers di Nuovo.  Yellowfingers had been one of the first places that had a discotheque downstairs.  I mean, Joe was a very interesting culture vulture.  The thing is—and as it happened is food had become an important part of restaurants.  What a concept.  And New York was behind the curve, so I had this power that they didn’t have.  New Yorkers didn’t know what food was.  They knew what a certain kind of restaurant was and they knew what certain kind of European restaurants were.  So to marry those things safely is something I understood and I learned how to do and I learned how to learn as I was going along.\n\tSo the result was a great review in New York Magazine that referred to me as “the Sol Hurok of food.”\n\nWeinraub:  Pretty good.\n\nWolf:  Yeah.  You should understand that as the son of a concert pianist, that was pretty good.  Judy Rogers proceeded to call me up and started screaming at me that I didn’t deserve to be getting press because I didn’t do the real, hard work, and I said, “Judy, read what it says.  It was the brainchild of Clark Wolf.  It was.  You didn’t bring yourself here on the subway.  This is an inappropriate phone call.  Go fuck yourself hard and get back to work.”  Click.  You know.  She’s always been afraid of me since, and she should be.\nTell the truth.  Tell the truth.  Tell the truth.  That’s my rule.  I don’t always like the truth, I don’t always like telling the truth.  It is not always received well.  What I learned is that you take all the skill sets you have, help to maximize the ones or find the ones that you don’t have available, fill in the gaps, the challenges, find the things that are undiscovered resources, and bring them forward in a positive way and tell the truth, maybe in private, but I learned very early on that that if bullshit isn’t 80 percent true, it doesn’t work.\nAnd I also learned—and it was really a relief to me—that if you tell a journalist a lie, you’ll soon be not getting any more phone calls.  I saw very big-named oft-quoted people suddenly disappear from the conversation because they lied.  They took advantage. They were arrogant.  David Lederman is a great example of this. Finally I said, “How come you didn’t talk to David Lederman about this?”  I said this to a journalist.\nShe said, “Never again.  He lied and I caught him twice.  Done.  Done.”\n\nWeinraub:  At that point, in terms of who was in the food consulting business, Joe Baum—\n\nWolf:  It was Joe Baum, George Lang, and their disciples.  The end.  Restaurant Associates, big companies.  I didn’t come from Cornell.  I didn’t come from Lausanne.  I couldn’t afford it and I wouldn’t have done it anyway.  I felt that they were already anachronistic.  People would ask me, “Do you want to be the next Joe Baum?” and I would say, “Ugh.  Short little cranky guy who yells at people?  No!  I want to be the first me, but not with quotes around it.  I don’t know what I want.  I want to work.  I want to do what I do.”  I became a consultant in part because I’m entrepreneurial and somewhat unemployable.\n\nWeinraub:  But you must have sensed that there was room for somebody like you.\n\nWolf:  Clearly.  Because I do have an ability to see more things around me than others do and put them together in ways that others don’t, and that, along with skill sets, is what makes a consultant.  After the first Cook’s Magazine’s “Who’s Who,” which was in ’84, I was asked by Chris Kimball to help identify the food makers who might be in the first fifty Who’s Who of Cooking in America Awards, that included James Beard, Julia Child, Craig Claiborne, an extraordinary collection of people.  So I assisted, and some of the food people included Laura Chenel and her goat cheese, and D’Artagnan foie gras, and we few of us remember Jeff Hvid, a forager.  1984.  It was at the Abigail Adams Museum here in Manhattan.  It was in a big, stuffy, hot room, all at one level.  The intensity and the magic in the room was so thick that I walked up to Chris and I said, “Great idea.  Lousy party.”\nAnd he said, “Fuck you.  Next time you do it.”\nSo for the next seven years or five years or whatever it was, I did it, and that meant I was a consulting editor to Cook’s Magazine.  I wrote once in a while.  And I helped develop a strategy that included broader people.  We did it at the National Arts Club; we did it at the Equitable Center; we did it at the Palladium, the nightclub; we did it at Lincoln Center twice.  So I did it five times, and I emceed it four of those five times.  So, yeah, I was a new voice of this new construct.\nIn ’85 I also founded the New York chapter of the American Institute of Wine and Food, which was an organization started in California by Bob Mondavi, Julia Child, and Richard Graft.  I had been involved in that not at the very first meeting, but starting from about the second meeting.  It was immediately the largest chapter.  I learned also about launching more.\n\nWeinraub:  Tell me why you felt that there was a place for that here.\n\nWolf:  Well, because what I liked about the AIWF then was it was a crossroads uniquely of professional and non-professional, of various fields and various interested parties, and that had never been done before.  It was more than the sum of its parts, and it was usefully embracing. semi-academic.  It’s more powerful.  If you have academics in front of practitioners, you know what I mean, if you have cheese mongers in front of professors, things happen that wouldn’t ordinarily in their own little world. \n\nWeinraub:  Yes.\n\nWolf:  And it’s not for every day, but it’s for once in a while, carefully presented, carefully constructed, carefully achieved, carefully gentled with iron will.\nSo I cancelled the first two things and the first event of the AIWF chapter in New York was Wines of the U.S.A.  This is in ’85.  Bruce Springsteen had an album called Born in the U.S.A.; that was the takeoff.  It was something like July or August 28th in a restaurant that everybody hated.  It was $15.  There were wines from thirty-four states, not all of them delicious.  And it blew everyone away.  We had three hundred people.  It was an amazing experience.\nWhat I learned from that was in many cases, many times in certainly new businesses, new organizations, new efforts, you only have one choice: success.  Every single hit must be out of the park or a triple or whatever.  You need to be successful in one way or another, and there are lots of ways of being successful.  That’s what moving forward was all about.  So I was very careful, and for two and a half years I was the president of the chapter, chairman, whatever it was called.  I sat on the national board, so I ended up being this kid with a B.A. in English literature from San Francisco State University commuter school, on the board of directors with some of the world’s most seasoned—I used to trade final or penultimate sessions at the American Institute of Wine and Food Conferences on Gastronomy with Johnny Apple, and it was because I was the only one who could follow him—that’s a pretty pushy thing to say—and also if he had to cancel and go cover a war, they knew I could cover.\nI was the program chairman, so for six conferences I conceived the structure of what a semi-academic, specific interest, multidisciplinary blah, blah, blah conference would be so that people would go away from it with a sense that something had happened.  It was fascinating and I loved it.  It included topics I didn’t know about.  We were talking about American agriculture in the eighties.  It was my graduate studies.  That’s what I could afford to do. I gave my time and energy and I got real graduate exposure across the board in wine, in culture, in farming, in so many things.\n\nWeinraub:  I would think that you would have known as much, if not more, than Johnny at that point.\n\nWolf:  I’ll leave it up to you to say.  I knew as much or not more about a lot of things, not the world, and I hadn’t traveled as many places, but, yes, that’s why he liked me.  Also we were funny.  So this is what I did for many years.  At the same time, I helped to found the American Cheese Society.  I was one of those early kids who just—the American Cheese Society lived in my basement for two years and it only cost me $1500 a month to support it.\nThis is a period of time where it was so interesting.  I had to learn about a lot of things.  I began to be well known in my early thirties, like thirty-three.  There was a piece on me in New York Magazine, “A Wolf in the Kitchen.”  They used to have a section called Fast Track, right?  And there was a picture of me and I was holding a glass of champagne, on the telephone, with my fluffy hair and my Sally Jesse Raphael glasses.  I had a cold, I was about to get on an airplane, and they took this thing and it was a huge hit.\nThen I began to see that being famous was another full-time job and that it required money and time and energy and was disconnected from my heart, so I ducked.  I was on the Great Entertainers Council with people who turned out to be Martha Stewart and Lee Bailey and Beverly Sassoon.  Then I would see people like Brian McNally get these four-page stories and then crash and burn and go to hell.  I didn’t want to do that.  I didn’t know what I knew yet that was sufficiently developed to make me happy inside.\n\nWeinraub:  Had you started Clark Wolf Associates at that point?\n\nWolf:  It’s never been called that.  It’s always been Clark Wolf Company, and I incorporated in 1986, simply to be taken seriously.  You know, remembering that James, as a benchmark—or not a benchmark, really, but a guide, it’s not that people didn’t know he was gay, it’s that it wasn’t an issue.  He was so nonsexual.  I used to joke that the voice of American cookery is an aged English woman, including James.  Well, I wasn’t a cookery person, so I needed to be presented as kind of this appealing young fellow of indiscriminate focus.  I was not entirely comfortable being out.  I never lied to anybody, I’d had a girlfriend in California.\nI was told in California that I could marry well in San Francisco, and I said, “I’m gay!”\nAnd the woman said, “As long you’re discreet, if you marry well and show up for dinner on time in the right outfit, that’s fine.”\nAnd I thought, that is exactly the last thing in the world I ever want.  I mean, oh my gosh.  So, for example, that’s what caused me to really dislike and distrust Peter Kump, because I met this gay man who had been married and had kids, and whenever possible, with his boyfriend in the other room fixing things, would talk about his wife and family whenever it suited him.  It’s called being a sociopath, and I found him to be, may he rest in peace, an absolute bold-faced A-1, double-plus straight-on liar.\nThere was an article in New York Magazine—this is completely verifiable—and in it they would do an annual/periodic piece about the New York cooking schools.  There was a picture of Dorothy Hamilton, Dorothy Cann’s new French Culinary Institute’s kitchens and her gorgeous young French chef, double-page-spread photograph, and they screwed up the caption, as New York Magazine is wont to do, and it said “The kitchens at Peter Kump’s cooking school.”  Now, that’s bad enough, and that’s where I coined the phrase “Nobody has ever accused New York Magazine of committing journalism.”  That’s not what bothered me.  Peter Kump had it copied and used it as his brochure, and actually in a confrontation with me and Dorothy, because we were going to try to do something together, the three of us, he said, “Oh, it’s just marketing.  You would have done the same thing.”\nAnd Dorothy and I said, “Peter, no, we wouldn’t have.  It’s called lying.  It’s called stealing.  We don’t do that.  And you don’t build something as important and elemental as cookery on a bold-faced theft and lie.  Icky, poopy, feh.”\nI also didn’t want to be Lee Bailey.  They wanted me to be a party and design fag, and I’m a gay man, but it’s only a descriptor.  You know what I mean?  I’m a lot of things, and that’s only an adjective, not a noun.  I didn’t want to be a professional homosexual.  I mean, that’s another story.  [laughs]  I wasn’t built for it.  But the agent that I had that sold my book also represents Colin Cowie, another example of ew, yuck.  I don’t want to be a caricature.  I want the culture to catch up with me.  I’m young enough.  I have energy enough.  I have patience, I think, I hope.  You know what I mean?  So I ducked.  It was hard.  It was difficult.  I had to put down some lightning.  I learned a lot from it and I’m grateful.\n\n\n[Interruption]\n\nWeinraub:  This is Judith Weinraub.  This is a continuation of my second interview with Clark Wolf.\n\tWe’ll stop for a moment and turn off the air conditioning.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nWeinraub:  We’re back.  Why don’t we go back to your development as a consultant and tell me where that leads.\n\nWolf:  If you recall, I got a degree in English literature because it was really all I could afford to do.  I learned how to learn.  So what I discovered was, as a consultant and having this experience with the Santo family, that it had multiple layers and it was all about applying what you’d learned.  As a high school student in Advanced Placement English, I learned to come in late, not having read the book, listen so that I could perceive, analyze so that I could have something to offer, and articulate, whether it was I raised my hand—once I got it, I would raise my hand, say something very strong with a particular viewpoint that was very clear, and then shut up and hide the rest of the time if I had to.\nSometimes I would write an essay, and it really was about thinking.  In retrospect, I wasn’t cheating.  I wasn’t even cheating myself.  I was doing what the exercise was designed to do, just my way.  What happened was, I would get papers, and my favorite paper would be one where I got an A, and the teacher would write at the top “This is an answer to the question I didn’t ask but probably should have.”\n\nWeinraub:  That’s great.\n\nWolf:  And that was in high school.  So what I did was, I continued to learn how to learn.  And when I was with James, I realized that all of it was a wonderful experience and all of it was a learning experience.  With James I really determined that I was going to be a person who learned for the rest of his life.  If I was lucky, I would learn for the rest of my life.  I loved the difference between people in their sixties, seventies, and eighties who went to cultural institutions to just rack them up, just divert themselves, and those who actually were moved and changed.  Having been on the railroad as a waiter, I felt that if you go someplace and don’t take yourself with you, you aren’t really there as who you are, you’ve missed out.  But if you come away from a new place unchanged, you’re a fool.  So I tried very hard to do that, to always bring myself and to never leave unchanged.  And that’s what I’ve been trying to do all my life.\n\tSuddenly James dies, blah, blah, blah, long story short.  And Emily Gilder gives me a Saks Fifth Avenue bag filled with things that she’s fished out of the garbage can because he was emotional and not sentimental.  They had things like his honorary degree from Reed College.  This is the college that threw him out because he was—\n\nWeinraub:  I’m sorry.  Who gave you this?\n\nWolf:  Emily Gilder, Jim Beard’s assistant.  In it were letters from M.F.K. Fisher, from Elizabeth David, from Paul Bocuse, three-page handwritten top to bottom, side to side suicide note from his early collaborator José Wilson.  Yet I must tell you, in retrospect, it was an extraordinary lesson for myself as a person who has experienced cycles of depression and had a father who was periodically depressed.  This is a woman who, had she lived in this day and age of drugs, would be alive today.  She was just dealing with cyclical misery.  It was a brilliant letter.\n\tThere I was, and what happened was, I began to have a respect for the fact that I was at times experiencing history.  I sat with James, one of our little morning visitings, because I lived kind of kitty-corner.  He lived on Twelfth off of Seventh, and I lived at Waverly and Eleventh, just off of Seventh.  I could run over in ten seconds, although I was in a fifth-floor walkup, that was sublet illegally to me by a guy who was working for the International Herald Tribune in Paris.  He abandoned several pieces of really good Mission furniture that I didn’t want because it was reminiscent of living in northern California, that I now treasure.\nOkay.  So here I was, sitting with Jim Beard.  The phone rings and it’s Arthur Schwartz at the Daily News, discovering and asking him how he feels about—oh, what’s his name?  Richard [Nelson].  Some fellow from northern Oregon or somewhere up there in the Northwest who has basically written a cookbook, a third of which is stolen from James, a third of which from Richard Olney, and a third of which is from some dead Italian.  I was there at the start of a news story that became a major scandal nationally and internationally in our very small world.  So it was interesting to be able to see how these things worked and how, if you want to, and as Gerald Asher, who wrote for thirty years as the wine editor of Gourmet, said, it’s not what you do; it’s who you are doing it, which I thought was brilliant.  If you pay attention, history happens and it can have a huge impact and you can make choices.  I really just wanted to be useful.  So I realized that information and the work of talented people, having been a literature guy, I was less interested in the tortured poet.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nWolf:  I wasn’t interested in the tortured, starving poet; I was interested in other kinds of history and other kinds of movement, and to me, food was so mobile, you could be a drunken bus boy and in five years be a leader in your community and a multimillionaire and really doing things that changed the world.  I can give you some names here in New York, but I won’t.  All right?  Or you can be an honorable person and you can fall into the depths of drugs and alcohol too, and usually they’re brothers.  But anyway, I was collecting intellectual structures, social structures, cultural structures.  I didn’t really realize it at that time.\n\nWeinraub:  That’s what I was going to ask you.\n\nWolf:  I was only partially aware.  I knew I was learning.  I knew I was putting things into a way of being able to explain and share.  I knew that oversimplifying was not my choice, although as I’ve come to get older, I feel that even more powerfully.  I had a tendency, and I seem to retain this tendency, to be able to crystallize things verbally, so that I was quoted a lot.  I was accused of being Mr. Sound Bite.\n\nWeinraub:  It’s a good thing to be able to do.\n\nWolf:  It’s not a bad thing to do, but in point of fact, the reality is, I tend to be able to say something succinct and resonant because I’ve thought about it a lot.  Joe Baum used to always say, “Don’t ever talk to a journalist.  Call them back.”  Well, that would be Joe.  This is me.  I’ve already given it a lot of thought, all of it, all the time, like crazy, and I tend to be in front of the curve of what people write about, not because journalists aren’t up to the moment, but because they have to write about what their editors and what their readers want, so therefore they have to hit it at the right moment culturally.  They’re the practitioner and it’s got to hit.  I’m just thinking.\nAnd I tend to be a tougher critic than critics, so I learned how to—and I’m grateful for this—I learned how to judge the dynamic of restaurant criticism amidst some of the smartest people in the world.  I got to watch Craig Claiborne.  I got to see Gael Greene against Bryan Miller, against Molly O’Neill, all at the same time, all writing at the same time, all talking to each other in print.  So I knew how to be part of the conversation because I knew what the conversation was, and I was able to look and see what they got right and what they got wrong.  So when I did something as a consultant and they understood it correctly, it made me very happy.  When I did something as a consultant and they understood it incorrectly to the benefit of my client, it actually made me feel guilty.\nMy worst experience about that—and it’s so funny—is that I was working on the Post House with Alan Stillman.  I worked for Joe Santo, Alan Stillman, and Faith Stewart Gordon, three of the most accomplished, toughest restaurateurs in New York history.  I’ve also since worked for Shelly Fireman.  He’s the only other one that’s that difficult.  I wouldn’t ever work for Warner LeRoy because he was more difficult than he was fun, and quite frankly, I didn’t think I could learn anything from him.\n\tBut what was I telling you?  So I was working at the Post House, and the first thing I did was tell Alan Stillman—and the Post House is a great example.  He had owned the restaurant where it got four stars and went out of business.  In other words, it’s not about being the best by some standards; it’s about doing what’s right for you.  And I learned then you have to build a restaurant that works for the people running it and for the people enjoying it.  Everybody else has got to fit in the middle.  I learned that the first thing you need to do in a confused restaurant is to clarify.  So I made him take out everything that wasn’t American, so it became an American restaurant and steakhouse.  I made him trim the bones and cover the lamb chops, and I made him take out anything that was messy and start all over, reconstruct from a better ground.  You know what?  It’s a good way to approach any food business.\n\nWeinraub:  How did you do that?  You looked at the menus?  You looked at service?  You looked at what?\n\nWolf:  I ate everything.  You know what’s funny is I also had to prove myself in a lot of ways constantly, which is the nature of life, but I was a hot shot with fluffy hair and a lot of Armani suits.  You know, I was a first-generation southern California Jewish gay boy and I was in an old union house.  They were serving very good meat that was completely unseasoned.  So I would ask Marion Cunningham, “How do you make meat good?” and she said, “Well, dear, there’s only one secret: salt.”  And I asked everybody and they told me that the way to salt beef is on the turn.  That means you put it under the broiler or on the grill, and before you turn it, you salt it, you turn it, you salt it.  That’s it.  That seems to be, all things considered, in a not completely controlled environment, the safest bet for getting a good seasoning and a good relationship with the salt and the crust and the interaction or whatever.\nSo I had an assistant then, a little tiny skinny girl named Anna Herman, and I didn’t do it, the restaurant kitchen was through a hallway which was the pantry and the dishwash down two flights of stairs to a basement kitchen with an eight-and-a-half-foot ceiling that was 120 degrees in the summer.  It was a couple of old union Latin grill guys who were as wide as they were tall, and they tested the meat with their thumbs.  This is a raging broiler.  I had Anna, in a little dress, stand there with a cup of kosher salt, and for six hours salt on the turn, salt on the turn, salt on the turn.  Tips went up markedly.  I mean, suddenly everyone, “Where did you get this—?”  So I got their attention.\nThe next thing I did was—and this is like ’88—I reintroduced something I had grown up with in California, the Caesar salad.  I had all union waiters; they knew how to do it.  We brought a trolley.  Now, they used an emulsified—that means we added a little mustard—dressing that they picked up from the cold station, from the pantry salad station in the hallway.  They did it in the bowl.  They asked if you wanted extra anchovy, all those things.\n\nWeinraub:  What year was this?\n\nWolf:  I think ’88, something like that, ’87, ’88.  And I had them all doing it.  It was $7.25 for something that cost 73 cents.  They all got great tips.\nSo about a month and a half into it, I had a meeting with the staff, with everybody, and I said, “Okay guys, what do you think?  What do you love?  What do you hate?”\nAnd at one point some guy says, “Well, do we have to mash those anchovies?  I mean, it’s really a mess.”\nI said, “Okay, guys.  This is representing over 28 percent of the business.  You’re all getting great tips.  All of you whose wrists are too limp to mash an anchovy, please raise your hand.”  They got it.  As I said to a guy who worked for me, “I may be gay, but I ain’t no sissy.  I’ve been a waiter on the railroad.  Shut the fuck up.”  And they laughed and then they trusted me.\nSo it was a question of—and this is what I do to this day—build trust, make success.  If I ask somebody to do something that was more difficult, it was always married with something that was better and easier.  It’s a series of skill sets that are consultant-based, but they’re not just consulting-based; they also have to deal with my personality, because it has to be a reflection of who’s actually doing it.  You know, some of this is not just what restaurant a chef could cook at, but what will really suit their abilities.  Then after that I was doing these AIWF events down at the Regency Hotel, so I was doing different kinds of things that were kind of crossover.  I was doing a series of individual food tastings, milk tastings, butter tastings.\n\nWeinraub:  Explain what AIWF meant and is.\n\nWolf:  The American Institute of Wine and Food was a real effort to gather these multidisciplines.  It was ultimately backed and overpowered by the wine industry that was basically using it as a way to raise the credibility of American wine and control what happened.  It’s funny, oftentimes wine or other alcoholic beverage industry pieces are fuel for the development of culture and business, but anytime they get in control, they ruin it.  They can’t help it.  It’s like when real estate or finance takes over, if there isn’t a balance, their natural appetites are destructive.  So I was one of the food guys in the American Institute of Wine and Food.\n\nWeinraub:  Explain for whom those events were.\n\nWolf:  Well, the events at that time were for smarter, more modern professionals, interested parties and cognoscenti.  There really was a cognoscenti in New York City, and in order to be part of that, you had to give something that no one else was giving.  It was our form of a tactile salon.  Steven Spector had Le Plaisir, which was a restaurant on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that later became an American place where Barbara Kafka and Paula Wolfert and James Beard hung out and talked about food.  Okay.  It was one of the first real food-related salons in New York City.  I was a kid and I joined the salon and I brought the salon with me from time to time.  So I was doing events where we had groupies.  So you wanted to be on that panel because it was credibility-making.  People would come and say, “I want to work for you for six months or a year and then I want to go out and do business for myself.”  In other words, you want to learn from me and then steal my client base.  Thanks.\n\nWeinraub:  What I’m saying is, who was the audience?\n\nWolf:  The audience was anybody who was smart enough to be the audience.  In other words, it was wine makers; it was restaurateurs; it was chefs; it was food writers; it was authors; it was people with enough money to go to a tasting.\n\nWeinraub:  And they were paid events?\n\nWolf:  All paid.  All paid.  And not necessarily cheap.  I wanted to do things that got attention, that surprised people, that changed the conversation.  When we did a butter tasting, people were blown away.  Americans didn’t realize what butter was.  They didn’t know what the water content was in butter.  I mean, it was shocking.\nWhen we did a sparkling rosé tasting at Maxims de Paris, we did it with half—I want to say six sparkling wines from California and six sparkling wines from France.  Afterwards, the Consortium de Champagne banned such events worldwide, permanently.  It was so powerful and interesting, and they couldn’t control it.\n\nWeinraub:  Interesting.\n\nWolf:  I wanted every single thing to be four-run home run out of the ballpark, oh, my god, life-changing.  And we did the Marketplace Tasting, which was based on the tasting of summer produce in Oakland, which got farmers across the table from people, and the Marketplace Tasting was conceived—we did it for ten years in both of the armories, in the alley behind the French Culinary Institute, in the kitchens of FCI.  I wanted to show that New York—this is where I got the phrase “If it grows in Manhattan, scrape it off.”  But that New York is one of the great crossroads of the world and it’s the marketplace of the world.  In those days, this was actually just at the beginning of the green markets.\n\nWeinraub:  This was under the aegis of AIWF?\n\nWolf:  All under AIWF, yes, so the local chapter hosted this and we did these benchmark events.  My purpose was, I wanted to do events in New York City that, when they’re successful here, we’ll roll out across the country because if it can work in New York City, it can work in Dallas, it can work in L.A., it can work in Santa Barbara, it can work in Tucson.  And a lot of them did.  Some of the things that the AIWF does—and it’s a much smaller, quieter organization now partly because many of our goals were achieved.  Sometimes when a movement achieves its goals, it dissipates.  We wanted to get food on the national agenda.  We wanted to get nutrition between the eyes of food people.  We wanted to get food between the eyes of nutrition people.  We did all these different initiatives.\n\nWeinraub:  But you were not being paid for any of this?\n\nWolf:  I paid to do it.  That’s why I say it was truly postgraduate work, because I was being a hot-shot consultant, getting my name in the newspapers, helping people be a successful restaurant, to pay for this.\nSuddenly at that time Jon Tisch needed somebody to help, and the guy at the Regency recommended me, and I began what was to be a twelve-year consultancy where I was their inside-outside guy.  So they bought up like eighty or a hundred days a year.  It was my base.  I was their ex-officio, basically, VP of food and beverage for Loews Hotels all over the country, in fact all over the world.\n\nWeinraub:  But how did that work?  You were introduced to him.\n\nWolf:  Yes.  He had seen some of the events that I’d done for AIWF at the Regency, and he understood that I understood basic business and how to bring these things forward, how to do it in a way that would be successful and high profile, but also reasonable and real and doable.\nThe first thing I did was help him with Santa Monica, which was unhelpable, and I helped it.  This is a place where the chef was French.  We were on the beach at Santa Monica, and of course in the lobby bar and lounge you had to have salsa and chips, and the French chef was producing the worst salsa and chips in America.  So I grabbed the chef by the hand and I said, “Let’s go to the kitchen.”  And I asked for the attention of everyone in the kitchen.  This is in Los Angeles.  “Ladies and gentlemen, is there anyone here who knows how to make salsa?”  And of course, after the laughter died down, we had nine recipes.  We ended up with a triplet of salsas.  The chef took all the credit for it.  You know what I mean?  That kind of thing.\nI walked into the all-day restaurant at that restaurant, which was basically in those days they called them the coffee shop, and there was a huge chandelier the size of this room, and oversized chairs and thick carpet.  I turned to the chef and I said, “I feel that I’m about to be overcharged.”\nIt was putting into tangible terms visceral experience.  I was a spoiled Jewish prince.  I knew how to do that and how to relate that and what it was like and how to enjoy it, and I could explain how to do business that way that was viable and profitable and also good quality.  I did food conferences for their chefs and later for their food and beverage directors at various properties.  Prior to a new opening, I helped them open restaurants.  I helped them conceive a—I did every single possible permutation.\nI was working on a San Diego property, their Coronado property, and part of the reason he hired me is that I knew about the Oakville Grocery, and part of their deal to be able to sign a contract was they had to have an all-day specialty market that the folks in the quays across the way could use.  So there I was.  So it was a combination of trading skill sets, things I already knew how to do and could adapt for things that I wanted to be able to do and learn and could learn how to do, or could advise and guide others to do.  That’s how I built my portfolio of abilities.\nIn that period of time I worked for what were then credible PR companies.  Food PR used to be an honorable profession.  I’m not saying there’s none of it now, but there were agencies that really specialized in—they couldn’t lie, because if they did, they’d be out of business.  They were creative people who had learned things in the kitchen and shared them with America.\n\nWeinraub:  So what kinds of companies were they?\n\nWolf:  I didn’t work with very many, but I worked with the California Advisory Board, helping bring forward how cheese is made and what it is and all that good stuff.  I’ve worked with the Walnut Council.\n\nWeinraub:  That is good.\n\nWolf:  They’re wonderful.  What I did for the Walnut Council, again it’s never “I’m just going to sell your product.”  I was never a spokespuppy.  What I did was, I said, “Walnuts are a part of a construct that we need to understand, local, regional, seasonal, international.  We need it all.”  And walnuts are kind of a combination of a bunch of them.\n\nWeinraub:  And healthy.\n\nWolf:  And they’re very good for you and they don’t take bees to pollinate, and all those things.\nSo we took journalists around the country and we showed communities that embodied these dynamics.  So we started in western Sonoma, where I spend time.  We took them to Seattle.  We did something in Georgia, outside of Atlanta.  You know what I mean?  We did really interesting things that held up very well and have held up very well.  So I like to do things that are valuable and worthwhile and resonant and helpful and fun and all those good things, and profitable.\nSo what I found was that I could be an advisor at times.  I found that some people—Faith Popcorn was always wanting me to be part of her advisory panel for $300, and I would say, basically, “No.  You’re not going to use my head, which is better than most of your advisors and sell it.”  Because I find a lot of analysts analyze only one thing and they only know one process.  I happen to be a big-picture guy who can actually stand behind the counter and cut a piece of cheese, and in those days I could get it exactly on a digital scale on point.\n\nWeinraub:  So how much of that was work that you were doing pro bono, and how much were you being paid for?\n\nWolf:  It’s all a relative term.  Depends on what time and what.  I was working day and night.\n\nWeinraub:  I’m just wondering how you made a living.\n\nWolf:  I made a living being a hot-shot consultant for New York City restaurants and for hotels based in New York or the company based in New York, and then other gigs, but more than a third of my time, sometimes half of my time, was pro bono stuff, which I had to at times stop and pull back.  First of all, I’d earned my stripes.  Second of all, I was less inclined to do some of the really gritty, nasty stuff that you have to do.\nWhen “Biff” Grimes—when William S. Grimes became the critic for the New York Times, I basically told my clients not to open restaurants, because he didn’t know what he was talking about.  He didn’t like to go out.  He was not a good choice, and he knew it.  He turned it down twice.\nSo I did the Soho Grand; that had been very successful.  They wanted me to help them do the Tribeca Grand.  I said, “No restaurant.  He doesn’t know what he’s doing.  This is not a good business climate.  Let’s get a three-star restaurant sous chef to do amazingly good food at the bar and around it.  The heck with them.  Let’s do what we do for a living.”\n\nWeinraub:  Interesting.\n\nWolf:  He gave three stars to a bunch of restaurants that went belly-up instantly because they didn’t know what they were doing and he didn’t know what he was doing.  Who cares what a guy from Astoria thinks of a Manhattan restaurant, especially when he doesn’t want to go out, when he complains that he “doesn’t understand all this Valentine’s stuff, about a romantic dinner followed by you-know-what.”  Well, sorry, honey.  That’s more information than I want from you.  It’s only been done for 6,000 years.  Next.\n\tSo, again, truth-telling….  I did less in New York, and New York is very lucrative, but New York is very combative, and I really didn’t want to—there are times at which you are almost forced to be quite aggressively negative against other people.  That’s not my nature.  I only like to compete with me.  So I try to find new paradigms.  And also, again, I was nervous about being famous.  I didn’t like it.  I don’t mind being the center of attention as long as I can be controlling it or guiding it.  I like to be in the crossroads of attention.  You know what I mean?  The genesis of it, not the object of it.  It’s distorting and uncomfortable.  I can perform well, but I prefer to be passionate, intense, and memorable because I can’t help it and it’s appropriate rather than because somebody paid me eight bucks or three billion bucks.  You know what I mean?  I can perform, but this is too important.\n\nWeinraub:  But meanwhile, you were basically living here in New York.\n\nWolf:  Yes, and then I was involved with someone who wanted to open a restaurant, and I realized that if I didn’t open a restaurant with him, that would be that.  So we opened a restaurant.  And what’s interesting is that it did put all my basic principles on the line.  Here was the consultant.  And the thought was, okay, as other consultants have done, I’ll own part of a restaurant.  That will be part of my power base.  I’ll open a couple of restaurants together with these guys.  It’ll be good income, and I’ll continue consulting.  Well, I folded down everything except for the Loews Hotel thing, and it turned out—\n\nWeinraub:  Oh, wow.  I see.\n\nWolf:  —the two partners were fearful.  One was fearful and the other was lazy.\n\nWeinraub:  And that was the Markham?\n\nWolf:  That was the Markham.  It truly was frightening and wonderful, because Ruth Reichl was the critic, and Ruth Reichl and I had the same palate because we grew up in the same context, even though she’s from Eleventh Street.  She lived in Berkeley.  I went to the Swan, where she started in a natural food restaurant at Cal.  You know what I mean?  We’d grown up together.  We had the same palate.  She was one of those people that taught me to taste, that was around those tables.  So I figured if she likes it, we’re good.  If she doesn’t like it, I’m over, I’m done, because I’m lying to myself.  She wrote, again, one of those benchmark reviews that if I would have written the review for me and had the New York Times publish it, that was it.  She wrote about these three restaurants that I had built in one place.  It was amazing that it was one restaurant early, another restaurant in the middle of the evening, and another restaurant later on at night.  I built a modern, timeless Manhattan brassiere across from Forbes.\nNow, it ended, thankfully, to the demise of the relationship.  My partner and I, we sold out to the third partner, whose money it was, really, and who was crazy and icky and Swiss.  His father put in the money and he lost 30 percent of it the day he gave us the money, because the dollar went down, blah, blah, blah.  So I made sure I wrote into the deal that if after eighteen months we were paying our bills and it was on the up and up, we could choose to buy each other out.  He thought that my ego would be too involved and I’d give him a bunch of money.  I said, “No,” because I knew what was going on in my personal life.  I pressed the button, we got a couple of bucks, we got out, and left a packed restaurant.\nThe next week, a full-page story in New York Magazine, Marian Burros had done a wonderful piece about a scotch-tasting I had done just before.  I mean, it was rocking and rolling.\nAnd in the course of that, I met the life editor of Forbes, who interviewed me a little bit, and I ended up writing a column for the back of Forbes for two and a half years, called “Napkin Notes.”  It was basically my diatribe about what people should know and do and be realistic about, and it was meant to be an entertaining and enlightening and trend-watching and all those things.  I enjoyed it.  Until they had to let go of all their columnists, I loved doing that.\nSo I went back to consulting.\n\nWeinraub:  Meanwhile, what was happening with your relationship with James?\n\nWolf:  He had long since died.  What’s interesting is that he said something to me that Maggie Waldron said to me.  Maggie Waldron was at Ketchum in San Francisco.  She had Maggie’s Kitchen.  She was one of those old-time old-school public relations ladies who really knew about food and really—now, mind you, at the Food Editors Conference, she was one of those PR ladies who could hold you by the elbow, because they invited you, with such a steel grip that you had no feeling in your fingers, but you added to the conversation.\nMary Lyons was the woman from Food and Wines from France.  She was brilliant too.  She took me all over northern France.  Anyway, these were people who educated up-and-coming practitioners of all sorts and informed the conversation for generations.\nSo Maggie did a piece about me.  She had a thing in her company called Market Watch, and the first guy interviewed was Joe Baum, and the second guy interviewed was me.  Wow.\n\nWeinraub:  Yes.\n\nWolf:  So she was talking to me about how I might consider going into advertising because I really had that kind of mind that was creative, blah, blah, blah, and then suddenly she stopped in mid-sentence and said, “Oh, my gosh.  I’m sorry.  You have a career.”\n\nWeinraub:  And this was approximately what year?\n\nWolf:  Eighty-three, ’84, something like that.  Then suddenly James was kind of doing the same thing.  After I’d finished with Barbara, he was, “There’s a little market that’s going to be over there.”  And suddenly he turned to me one day and he said, “You actually have been building this career.”  So I got that acknowledgement, you know, and I also realized that what he taught over and over and what he visited over and over were benchmarks.  It’s my nature too.  He remembered his benchmarks from being three and eating an onion.  One day he called up and said, “Do you like crème brulée?”\n\tAnd I said, “I think so.”\n\tHe said, “Come on over.  I’m making a good one.”  So I came over, and there he was, it was James Beard with a pan of ice and water in it and a souflée, a full-size four-quart souflée, with a blowtorch gratinée-ing the top of the crème brulée until it was an ice-skating rink.  It was Wolman rink.  And he said, “Now, listen.  This is the sound.”  And he took a big silver spoon and went “thwack” and it resonated.  It rang like a bell.  And we ate the whole thing, and believe me, I ate my share.  That’s the kind of thing he would do.\n\tEven before I moved here, for Christmas—I’ve told this story; it was in the newsletter—Christmas was a country ham with mustard fruits and a purée of beets and a purée of spinach.  I mean, it was elemental but beyond brilliant.  And some of it was a lot of hard work over a long period of time to get something that you experience in a simple, complete way.\nThat’s the other thing I learned from being with him and from all of my experiences, and I love when Harold McGee explained to me that the complexity of the leaf, one leaf, is more complicated than we can, as humans, understand, but the experience is a leaf.  And that’s how I have always dealt with food.  All this other stuff aside, is it good or not?\nSo in this period of time I was learning how to taste; I was learning how to teach; I was learning how to translate into multiple uses of things.  Emily Gilder had given me this bag of letters which I locked in a drawer, at her direction.  She said, “You take this and when the time comes, you’ll know what to do with it.”  Wow.  First of all, what a thing to say to anyone.\n\nWeinraub:  She was the last person who worked for—\n\nWolf:  The last assistant to James Beard, and towards the end she gave all of his parties next door.  She also was somebody who, at her eightieth birthday, I gave a cocktail party for in my back yard on the Upper West Side and I couldn’t believe how all these old people could drink.  Whew!  They’d get more lucid, and they were all from Connecticut.  And at my fortieth birthday party, a bunch of them came to Shelter Island, where I gave myself a birthday party on a Sunday at four p.m. because I knew that people would be coming back from their weekend and could all coalesce.  It was quite wonderful.  You know, so much of this was about what I just said; it was putting things where they belong and then knowing what to do when the time is right.  That’s so much of the application of culture and it’s so much of my life.  Whatever it is I’m supposed to do and offer, a lot of it is lots of work and offering it in the right way at the right time, and staying in touch with that is quite a challenge.\n\nWeinraub:  So how does that relate, then—it sounds like it does—to helping Marion Nestle and why you were in the food services department.\n\nWolf:  Let me see.  I had all these years of dealing with people from different disciplines, and I had to make sure, as chairman, that I didn’t insult journalists, I didn’t insult academics, I didn’t insult wine makers, I didn’t insult rich ladies from Texas.  Them I insulted sometimes.  And it was an extraordinary tutorial in balance and credibility.\nSo Marian and I were at—well, I told the story of how I got to New York with Marian Burros and the New York Times and all that stuff.  I think I did the first time.  She had come to interview me about California cuisine.\n\nWeinraub:  Yes.\n\nWolf:  Okay.  So Marian Burros was having yet another book party, bless her heart, and the ambassador to the United Nations from the Philippines, giving her a party on 96th Street somewhere, and Marion Nestle was there.  I think we had briefly met.  She remembered meeting me at the Oakville Grocery.  At the Oakville Grocery I was so wound up, Marion Cunningham used to say I was like little white Sambo running around the tree and turning into Normandy butter.\nBut anyway, so we got to talking and she was telling me about her frustration and how she wanted to “food up” the Department of Nutrition.  And after a walk from 96th Street to the West Village to her place around Washington Square Park, I committed to helping her “food up” the nutrition department, which resulted in, within eleven months, through the department, the school, the university, and the State of New York, establishing the first food studies discipline program, where you could get a B.S., a master’s, and a Ph.D. in food studies.  This was, as I explained it to myself and to others, the course of study I would have taken had I had the opportunity back when I went to school many years before.  I used English literature to learn about life and what was important, about how to function in the world, about how to think, about how to learn, but I could have used food studies for sensory evaluation, culture, history, politics, economics, biology, all those things.  It would have been a bachelor of arts and sciences, which is even more interesting.  It is the most important thing in the world.\nSo I helped her marshal it through.  It’s so funny, we presented the two focuses, food studies—food studies meaning more pure in a culture way—and food studies, food management, because there had been a management side.  I said to her, “The management side, if it’s going to be in this department and not in the School of Hospitality or whatever, should be almost the same, with a couple of variations.”  And it’s interesting, because we sat at the Knickerbocker restaurant and watched the O.J. [Simpson] verdicts come in.  That will tell you what year this is.\nAnd she said, “What do I do?”\nI said, “Watch.”  We watched and we complained, and I said, “Make them almost exactly the same.  Take that back to the dean.”\nShe took it back to the dean, she said those things in her way.  [Snaps fingers]  Done.\nSo this was beginning to develop.  I was building a Continuing Ed component to this, which was less and less useful, but then the library got a gift of Gourmet magazine complete collection, and Marion helped to acquire the collection of Cecily Brownstone, whom I’d known with James.  Cecily Brownstone took me to what she referred to as the “third annual Cecily Brownstone takes James Beard to dinner for his birthday and brings Clark Wolf.”  That’s what it was called.  She was a pistol, and she taught me that you can know everything and still shoot from the hip and be hilarious and off-color and tiny and powerful.\nAnyway, I was thrilled.  Eighty-five hundred volumes and 5,000 food pamphlets, so that was the beginning of it.  Then what I did with Marvin Taylor and with Marion in the development of this collection is the same thing I’d done with the department.  I asked a lot of questions and helped develop a strategy for achieving identified goals.  I had wanted for a long time to do a Critical Topics symposium.\n\nWeinraub:  Back up for a second.  How did you develop the advisory committee?\n\nWolf:  So she said to me, “I need some help.”\n\tAnd I said, “Why don’t you develop an advisory committee of people who are only advisors, not board members.  In other words, we only ask them two or there times a year, we ask their advice and take some of it.  They’re overqualified, all of them, and there’s no upkeep.”  And since I knew all these people and Marion had a great reputation and knew some of them as well, and I ran the meetings, so I amused them.  We had them for a couple of years, and people would call afterwards and say, “When’s the next meeting?”  Well, that’s good.\nBut she got a lot of ideas.  She was able to present to the faculty, to the dean, to the advisory board there at school, whatever the various processes are, the credentials of the people sitting around the room.  So we really moved things forward quickly.  We were able to move things very quickly because we had a broad range of commentary.\n\nWeinraub:  Ballpark, when was that?\n\nWolf:  I don’t know.\n\nWeinraub:  Okay, we can fill that in.\n\nWolf:  It’s twelve or fifteen years ago.  I don’t know, because life seemed to be moving so quickly.\nWe thought if, in five years, we have a few master’s students, that will be great, and we had reached the five-year peak in the second year.  Obviously the need and the desire was huge.  I helped negotiate some—oh, what are they called? [Articulation agreement]. The two schools helped each other, so you could go to French Culinary Institute and those credits would apply to your—I forgot what it’s called; starts with an A.  So all those things started happening.\nI had long wanted to do a Critical Topics symposium.  I wanted to do these conferences that AIWF had done, that hadn’t been done by anyone else really well.  Timing was good, blah, blah, blah.  Well, the bitchy powers that be were so protective and so—they really wanted a wine and dine society, and they were terrified that someone would come in, and I was credible, so I could take over.  I didn’t want to take over; I wanted to utilize the mechanism for everyone’s benefit.  But there was a lot of jealousy.\n\nWeinraub:  And they presumably wanted to make some money for their organization.\n\nWolf:  And I was fine with that, but I wanted to be able to do it in a real context, in a real way.  There was a big group that really wanted me to help them and then there was a big group that really fought against it or undermined.  I’ve learned this for many years, it’s hard to make things succeed, but it’s really easy to make them fail.  Actually, the entire [unclear] kind of crumbled because of a couple of people who were self-involved and self-interested and really kind of awful, Susan Walter among them, these people who wanted to keep it on a scale that they could understand and therefore diminish what was possible.  I find that so disrespectful.  I intend for things to outreach me quickly.  I used to say that I wanted to be in a room full of people who were older, wiser, and more accomplished than I.  Maybe just wiser and more accomplished because I’m getting old enough to be in a room.  But you understand what I’m saying.\n\nWeinraub:  I do.  So that the timeframe of what was happening there with relation to the Critical Topics series was—\n\nWolf:  What happened was, we did the food studies department.  It was moving along.  I had done some Continuing Ed stuff.  The library was beginning to be developed, and I wanted to do this other thing.  Finally I said to them, “Listen, if you don’t let me do this, I will do a Critical Topics in Food somewhere.”  I don’t know if Marvin [Taylor] asked me or I asked Marvin, “What could we do?”\n\tI said, “I really wanted to do a Critical Topics in Food series, but series means three panels.”  And I explained to him and he loved the idea.\n\tHe said, “We do those kind of things here, and there will be limitations because of the nature of the place that might work for us.  It would be good if you had somebody from the faculty or from another department who was a NYU professor.  It would be good if you had an applied practitioner of some sort.  It would be good if you had some other kind of chronicler, whether it be a journalist or writer or —.”\n\nWeinraub:  All those good ideas, yes.\n\nWolf:  Yes. And because I knew what topics were important, we would do these things.  It took about four years, actually, but in four years, Kim Severson, who had been coming from time to time, wrote a piece about the collection and the books and the series, that was in the Times.  And the reason I wanted all this to happen was I wanted the information and the way of thinking to be more broadly embraced, more broadly accepted.  I wanted people to think in dimensions and not just for a quick fix, and I wanted people to see that they had a responsibility and that these things have to work in concert.  This was what I was good at.  That’s all I knew, is that this is what I was good at offering.\n\nWeinraub:  Tell me who you envisioned the audience as.\n\nWolf:  Well, I wanted master students who were in the program, to make sure that I could inform at least their attitude.  I wanted the professors from the department, and they have shown up.  I’ve seen them.  They’ve been wonderful.  I wanted some of those food historians and other people out in the community that just are interested and that will keep it a more lively, honest, contemporary conversation by not being academic.  And I wanted journalists and writers of all sorts.  I wanted to bring attention to the collection as a resource.  The purpose was always to say, “And we have books here you can read that will tell you more about this, and if you want to know more.”  I wanted every one of the Critical Topics in Food panels to result in people saying, “Oh, I wish that was two hours longer.”  “Oh, I wish I could go to a conference on that.”  “Oh, I wish I could write a book about that.”  “Oh, I wish I could make that my life’s work.”  That’s what my multileveled intention has always been.  And if we ever have one where people don’t say all those things, I’m disappointed.\n\nWeinraub:  That probably doesn’t happen very much, though.\n\nWolf:  What’s interesting is that Marion Nestle, the biggest, toughest critic, said recently—and I love this because she comes into them innocently because I try not to tell her too much—she turned to Kim Severson and she said, “These things are a lot better than they have a right to be,” which I thought was very funny.  But what it means is, they appear to be richer than you’d think something that feels this casual is, but the truth is, I’ve spent years thinking about every bit of it.  I’ve been very careful about juxtaposing voices.  So, for example, when we had a panel on “What’s With All These Books on Food?” the new explosion of food writing, I wanted the most superficial person, the most superficial example, not to be Rachel Ray, but to be Bill Buford, because a middle-aged white man with a three-piece suit and bad clogs, who has discovered Mario Batali is ludicrous.  It’s ridiculous.  It’s delightful, it’s wonderful, it’s superficial.  And if that’s the baseline, this is a more interesting conversation.\n\nWeinraub:  And it was a very readable book.\n\nWolf:  It was very well done.  I actually like his work in The New Yorker better.  I like other things better.  I couldn’t care less about the sweat on Mario’s brow, trust me, or be near it, but I love—\n\nWeinraub:  I said readable, not—\n\nWolf:  And the point is, when I called him, he said to me, “Oh, I was just going to call you to see if I could get on one of your panels.”\n\tAnd I said, “Well, I’m glad you didn’t, because I only invite, but I’d love you to be on this.”  I don’t think he was entirely happy.  I wasn’t icky to him, but it wasn’t a cheap promo; it was a real conversation.  So even the people who feel a little challenged by their place on the panel—I asked Pete Wells of the Dining section, “So isn’t a blog at the New York Times inherently an oxymoron?  Isn’t a blog something that wasn’t important enough to get into the New York Times?”  And he laughed.  I mean, the point is that it’s a public conversation with important practitioners, none of whom, if they’re any good, have ever minded a little challenge.\n\nWeinraub:  I thought the water one was really fascinating, because that brought together people that a lot of the audience really didn’t know about.\n\nWolf:  I want to make sure that there’s some recognition in a broader public, but that’s one place on the panel.  Bob Lewis has been around for a million years.  Everybody in New York, farming and markets, knows Bob Lewis.  Most of those people had never heard of Bob Lewis.  Bob Lewis blew them away with a combination of the—I mean, Lidia Bastianich has been speaking on these things for a hundred years.  I wanted her to say something that was different than she’d ever shared ever anywhere before.\nAnyway, so it happens to be, for me, a place where I can make some contributions and a training ground for me to do other things as well.  I really want to do a Charlie Rose of food.  I really want to do a more substantive kind of a thing in a broader context that more people can reach, although I love the fact that this is videotaped and archived.  It’s called an articulation agreement when educational institutions trade credits.\n\nWeinraub:  Who knew.\n\nWolf: Who knew.  Pea brain.  I need ginseng or to be thirty years younger.  Anyway, right?  So I’m doing it for all the right reasons, including for me.  And that’s what I’ve learned to do over time as I’ve learned more things, is that when I do things pro bono, I want them to be of great value to others and I need them to be of value to me too.  I feel that that’s really fair.  It’s an ongoing—all my life I’ve always felt I wanted there to be a balance between monetary gain or personal reward, influence, you know, or voice in the culture, and prestige, quality.  I wanted the comfort.  I’m willing to trade back and forth and back and forth.  I saw people spending their whole lives miserable so that at some point in their later life they might contribute—as they call it “give back.”  I’m first-generation with every kind of survivor’s guilt you ever met, and gay.  I’m not going to have any kids.  I have to do everything this life and I actually kind of embrace that theologically.\nI asked a rabbi teacher in college what Jews believe about heaven and hell, and he said, “Well, I’ll give you one interpretation.”  He said, “We believe it’s none of our business and that you’re supposed to work really hard and do the best you can now.”\n\nWeinraub:  That’s it.\n\nWolf:  And the other image I loved is that a Jewish Talmudic philosopher metaphysic is a man who stands on his own shoulders so that while his head is in the clouds, his feet can be on the ground.  And that’s the person I’ve tried to be.  I had a lot of early religious training and I didn’t like religion and I didn’t like the practices, and I don’t like suddenly starting Hebrew, the meaning of which I know not, in knee-jerk reaction, but I do embrace Judeo-Christian tradition and I like where it overlaps with Buddhism.  And food, at its best, has a spiritual component, has a cultural resonant—it’s the most important thing and it is nature.  So you have to be in concert with it.\n\nWeinraub:  How much of your time do you spend on things that make you some money and how much on these things?\n\nWolf:  It really changes.  It really changes from time to time.\n\nWeinraub:  But you have to keep your eye on at least paying the bills.\n\nWolf:  Oh yeah.  I mean, the problem is I’d just as soon not make money at all.  I couldn’t care less, and that’s a problem.  It was easier for me when I was in a relationship for ten years with someone who is much younger than I, so I could worry about him and say, “I’m doing it for the family.”  Now I’m single and I have to learn that I’m older and I’ve got to take care of myself and that I have to balance those things.  So I’m getting better at it, at saying I’m not going to sell for the highest bidder and be a hot shot.  I’m not going to give it away either.  Even when I do things that are educationally related, other than NYU, I charge something.\nI’m also getting better at saying to people, “This is where I want to be in a few years and I want to be able to make a living at this and have it be part of my living.”  I also like the practical side of the specialty foods industry, which is a 40-billion-dollar industry, and the food business, which is the largest industry in the world, and there are plenty of places to make money.  The good news is that in a downturn like this, in a down economic cycle, because my expectations are flexible, I use it to learn more.  I made less, I trade more of my time, but it’s then going to be valuable on the other end of the other upswing down the road.\nJulia Child used to say, “It’s not what you eat; it’s what you eat over four days.”  So the answer to your question is, you know, it’s not what I make; it’s what I make over four years or five.  Do you know what I mean?  And I feel very much that way, although there have been times when I had to fold down my business for some reason.  Again, when I was involved in the restaurant, so interesting, people still stop me and say, “When are you going to open it?” because they loved that restaurant, for all the reasons that I really love a restaurant.  I kept only one client.  I had no other income than with that client.  It wasn’t a bad income.  But I design some flower and tableware, so that brings me money for stuff I’ve done before.\nBut I had to start my business up again, because at the restaurant I no longer was the voice of the industry.  I was the voice of that restaurant, which made my partners furious and jealous.  They wanted me to be behind the scenes, but no journalist wanted to call some guy that they never heard of; they wanted to call Clark and get a snappy response.  So all the benefit went to the restaurant, made them mad, made me not able to get consulting gigs.  Extraordinary.  Just as I had a lot of success and public success with Loews Hotels, for many years people thought I only worked for Loews and wouldn’t hire me.  So I’ve done stuff in Vegas and I’ve really gotten better at—I’m really good at engaging and sharing excitement about things, not so much about myself, and so I get so excited that it’s assumed that I’m selling myself, but I’m really forgetting to a lot.  [laughs]  You know what I mean?\n\nWeinraub:  How do you see where you are now with where the future of the industry is?\n\nWolf:  Well, it’s interesting.  Again, I’ve had as many as six or seven people working for me.  I had done the consulting firm thing.  Didn’t like it.  It meant that I had to take on a lot of work that I didn’t like, didn’t believe in, to support other people’s salaries, you know.  No likee.  As usual, it will continue to be the largest industry in the world.  A lot of it more is mission-based, which it always should have been.  We have to de-industrialize to some degree, not 100 percent, because that is not viable.\n\nWeinraub:  What do you mean?\n\nWolf:  If 96 percent of our food is industrial, it needs to be 70.  Because once we hit the eighties—and I know this from scientists—the deconstruction of food-making became so doable that then the diabetes making the—they were so good at manipulating the components, that we’re all going to be dead soon.  So we have to de-industrialize some.  So I think there will continue to be a lot to do for everyone.  The thing is that there may be a period of time where once—it’s not classist, but I’ve always felt—and I said this to Marian Burros in the Times, like in the eighties—that some day the only trend and the only precious thing we’ll all be fighting for is really good, pure, wholesome, delicious food.  It is the logical thing.  Through history it is the thing we’ve all been fighting for.  Oil, wars, all this stuff is all about having the best figs, having access to fresh water, having delicious caviar.  All these things are fought over the best stuff, and the most important stuff is what you put in your body.  I mean, there was a time when it was desirable to be fat because it proved you had success in finding food.\n\nWeinraub:  A cushion between poverty and—\n\nWolf:  Right.  And now it has become the uber silliness of being thin.  I have so much safety, I have so much wealth that I can even afford to be thin and be protected from poverty and starvation.  It’s the ultimate trajectory.  It’s sometimes confidence and sometimes it’s bad surgery.  So I’m very much looking forward to it.  I’m as fearful as the next person about all of it, myself included.  I’m going to be fifty-eight and it’s a really pivotal time.  I still think I’m very young and lively.  I think that we’ve had a period of time where young anything—and that happens periodically—is very important, and the economic downturn makes people turn to the silver hair and say, “Oh, maybe we need somebody who knows something.”  I love—\n\nWeinraub:  Not yet.  [laughs]\n\nWolf:  Well, in today’s New York Times business section was an established story that said something that I have been saying for many, many years, certainly the last six, that sometimes venture-capital money backers will say to a restaurateur or a chef, “Okay, we built a restaurant for two million dollars and we got a 30 percent return.  We want you to spend six million dollars and get a 30 percent return.”  They think that it’s naturally incremental that the more they spend, they’ll still get the—and the thing is, what they’ve done is they’ve spent six or seven million dollars and lost two million dollars because it doesn’t work, because numbers on a piece of paper don’t mean anything if they’re not connected to human beings, cultural anthropology, and nature.\n\tOne of the other things I got to do as a result of the AIWF is I was invited by Carolyn Margolis, who was at the Smithsonian—this was really interesting to me.  She saw me facilitating.  I said the way to do a conference is to go to two or three or four places around the country, gather people in various specialties related to that topic, talk to them and see what’s important to them, and sift and vet and build, and not only will it pre-market and broaden the conversation, I mean, the three or four pre-conference symposia I would do around the country were worth their own value.  They were amazing.  She saw me doing this, and the result was—so she got me invited to facilitate at the Museum of Natural History.\n\nWeinraub:  In Washington?\n\nWolf:  In Washington, D.C., at the Smithsonian.  I demanded that there be science writers, scientists, diorama designers, administrators, fundraisers, all these different people.  It was a big table.  And I was nonplussed.  I did what I always do, which is I had them each talk about who they were, what they did, what their job really meant, not what it was called but what do they do, where they were from, and what was their first and what was their most memorable experience in the museum.  We cried five times.  The image of this person who turned out to be a very dry scientist telling the story of sitting as a small child in an art museum and listening to the sound of nuns’ habits swoosh across the floor was mesmerizing.  At the end of it, the president of—the guy who was in charge said, “For many years there’s been anthropology,” which I define as birds in a drawer, right?  Right?  Dead butterflies on a pin.  “And cultural anthropology, which is man’s place on Earth.”  And this is about—I want to say fifteen, sixteen years ago now.  He said, “We can no longer do those separately.”  The Smithsonian at a conversation I facilitated, the director of the Smithsonian Natural History Museum said, “We must study anthropology and cultural anthropology as one cycle, one construct.”\n\nWeinraub:  Absolutely.\n\nWolf:  I know absolutely, but [gasps].  So I feel very fortunate.  I mean, I did a conference at Loews L’Enfant Plaza in D.C. and I moderated a panel on restaurant reviewing with Ruth Riechl.  This was years ago.  Ruth Reichl turned to me and said, “You were born to moderate.”  [laughs]  Which is funny, because when I first got the job at the cheese shop, my professor, who gave me a recommendation, said, “You were born to run a cheese shop.”  So it’s these modest skill sets that can have a little bit of impact here and there.\n\tI think it’s going all in good places.  I think it’s going in all the places that it ought to go.  We just have to continue to marshal it along and we have to continue to keep it real.  I was taking to a major person at a national magazine that focuses on food, and she said, “How do we appeal to the young?”\n\tAnd I said, “By telling the truth with a straight face.  Don’t pander.  Just do it.”  Young people actually understand this better than the people who are—I mean, what we have to remember is—and again, it’s the same paradigm.  All you can know is where you are in the world.  That’s all you can know and then share that and see how it fits with everything else.  That’s why I tend to be that kind of a culture vulture.\nThe fact is that the reason we got caught is we thought that penicillin meant that we were invulnerable.  So for seventy-five years, you no longer died of a cold, you know, until we got AIDS.  All right?  That’s the whole story.  Industrializing of food-making was a miracle until it wasn’t.  The fact is that certain technological advances are blips.  They’re blips.  Now, if we take a look at the history of the world, it suddenly occurs that maybe Mayan civilization, Egyptian civilization, these other civilizations that are under the sand and dirt did the same thing.  They got so far along advanced until what they suddenly got good at killed them.  Now, mind you, they also may not have come along fast enough so that something that was natural killed them.  Sometimes they weren’t far enough fast enough.  We seem to be at a time when we have many of the facilities to be able to live in our world.  I mean, not at all to be existential, because that’s missing the point, I discover as a grown-up.  But to be of the nature we’re part of includes the mind, includes culture.  So I’m very grateful to be in America.  My parents got here.\nI was on a plane recently where a young man sat next to me.  We didn’t talk until we were about to land.  He was born in Calcutta.  He is half Indian and half Danish heritage, so he looks like a Danish boy with nice eyes, if you know what I mean.  He was doing his Ph.D. on the Farsi literature that relates to the indigenous capitalist community, as opposed to the colonial capitalist community.\nOne of the reasons it was so wonderful for a professor in the Department of Nutrition and Food Studies to do a Ph.D. on that immigration period of the late 1800s when it was Irish, Jewish, and German, is that immigration still works that way in food ways, but it was so discrete and distinct in three big chunks, that they could be studied and understood.  The purpose of academics is to study so that you know how to learn, not to study for its own sake, although those people are there.  I happen to be one of those people, again, because I’m an immigrant, because I’m first generation, because I feel the freedom and pressure of the immediacy and the finite nature of my life and my existence, I get to say, okay, what does all this studying mean?  How can we use it?  What does it mean?  Now what does it mean mid-range?  So my work as a consultant in food is anthropological in an applied fashion.  So in my English class I would perceive, analyze, and articulate, and as a consultant, I add to that apply.\n\nWeinraub:  Well, it’ll be very interesting in the next couple of years to see how things develop, see where we are.\n\nWolf:  What I find comforting is that there are more people studying it as a base discipline, and I’ve had a lot of people working for me that have had master’s in the program.  One of my other purposes in all this was to keep Beard’s legacy alive.  I have been involved in a lot of organizations.  I was there when the Beard Foundation was conceived by Barbara Kafka, Larry Forgione, and Peter Kump and they basically were all fighting to be the next James Beard.  They were doing it for themselves.  That doesn’t mean that good couldn’t come of it, so I laid low and watched them do—some people do smarmy things until the president was put in jail, and I’m very glad that they’re back on track.  It’s not a foundation; it’s a society.  Foundations are organizations that have a lot of money and do good works and give away money.\nBut my giving the papers in that bag to the library resulted in the University of Wyoming giving all the papers that Beard left to them for part of the Popular Culture Collection that never happened, to NYU, which led to Ruth Reichl wanting to give her papers, and they are the most important papers in the late twentieth, early twenty-first century, because Ruth has done the most.  Whatever you think of it, it’s the most important.\n\nWeinraub:  Absolutely.  And the most diverse.\n\nWolf:  And has led to the republishing of some of Beard’s books, some with John Ferrone, one of his original editors and collaborators and editors, and the Beard Foundation and others.  Simon & Schuster owned The Fireside Cookbook, and there’s a piece in there that Beard wrote in like ’49 that is absolutely relevant this minute.  It was like it was written this morning.  “Get fresh ingredients that are in season and local and start there.”  I mean, duh.  So part of this is my wanting to see the better stuff valued and maintained and brought forward so that our continued building is built on a solid foundation.\n\nWeinraub:  And I think to that end, there’s really no need for the next James Beard, because we have James Beard.\n\nWolf:  Exactly.  No.  I mean, that’s the whole point, and that’s what people discovered.  What makes me happy is, for example, on Bravo, which is very cheap television, but they discovered that it was appealing to watch people cook and compete with each other, but they’ve moved it to more professional practitioners because it was disappointing when at the end of the show this poor kid went out with an award and opened a restaurant and failed miserably.  We want the magic, the Queen for a Day to result in real life.  We want the excitement distilled and captured, but we really want it to mean something, so all these master shows and all the rest of it.  Again, I’m just in my own way trying to help the culture catch up to where I want it to be while I’m still alive to enjoy and engage.\n\nWeinraub:  You have many more years to do that, and I thank you very much for this conversation.\n\nWolf:  It’s my privilege.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tWolf - 2 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n","description":"A food and hospitality consultant, Clark Wolf has advised a wide range of clients including restaurants, hotels, casinos, public institutions, and specialty food companies.

It’s December 23, 2009.  I am with Nina Zagat in her office in New York City just off Columbus Circle.\nGood morning.\n\nZagat:  Good morning.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we start with your telling me a little bit about where and when you were born, where you grew up, something about your early life.\n\nZagat:  I was born on August 12, 1942 in New York.  I grew up on Long Island in a town called Merrick, and lived there and went to public schools until I went away to college.  I went to Vassar and then majored in philosophy—\n\nQ:  I did too.  [laughter]  It’s very unusual.\n\nZagat:  —and minored in history and economics, and then went to Yale Law School.\n\nQ:  Tell me something about your family in terms of what your parents did, their attitudes toward food, eating, that kind of thing.\n\nZagat:  My father was a lawyer.  My mother was essentially a homemaker and liked to cook.  My grandmother was a great cook.  My mother was an excellent cook.\n\nQ:  Was your grandmother born in this country?\n\nZagat:  No, my grandmother was born in Russia.  I just have the most wonderful memories of being with her at her house in the country during the summers, where we’d go out berry picking and make wonderful pies, and I’d get the extra pieces of dough to make into little blueberry things of my own.  She’d be baking bread early in the morning, so you’d wake up to the smell of bread baking in a wood-burning oven.  So they were very special memories of food that were not just about eating the food, but the smells, the environment, the preparation, finding the right ingredients, all the things that are really important.\n\nQ:  Had she always been that way, your grandmother?\n\nZagat:  As long as I knew.\n\nQ:  Did she teach your mother to cook?\n\nZagat:  She was my paternal grandmother.  My maternal grandmother, I never remember having anything that she cooked.  There was one dish that I sort of remember people used to say she did well, but it was something that didn’t appeal to me at all, so I never ate it.  But my mother was a good cook.\n\nQ:  How did she get into that, do you know?\n\nZagat:  My mother?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nZagat:  I think just by being a good mother and wife.  It didn’t come from the same kind of passion that my grandmother’s cooking did.  It was doing something that needed to be done and doing it very well and professionally.\n\nQ:  What do you recall of family dinner memories?  What kind of attitude toward food was there in the family?\n\nZagat:  I think everybody in our family always appreciated good food, liked good food, put a value on good food, so I think that the fundamental belief that good, healthy, fresh food was important was always there.\nI’m trying to remember the kinds of food that my mother made.  I went through a period in my life where things like roast beef that had fat on them and juices running out of them just really was repulsive to me.  It’s very interesting to watch your own evolution, because I went through a whole—you know, the beginning period where I’m sure I ate everything and was happy with everything, and then I started getting very critical about various things. I still cut off all the fat from anything that I eat, even though I’m perfectly happy to down more than my share of foie gras.  [laughter]  I think it’s something aesthetic more than real.\n\nQ:  All that white stuff is a little scary.\n\nZagat:  There was a while when I just wouldn’t eat things like that. I remember at one point my mother taking me to the doctor to say, “Is this all right?  My daughter isn’t eating all of these things.”\n\tAnd the doctor said, “What does she like to eat?”  I loved fresh fruit and vegetables and all those things, and he said, “Leave her alone.  Let her eat what she wants to eat.  She’s healthy and she’s happy.  Just let it be.”\n\tIt’s very interesting, because I know that with my own children that was an attitude I always had, which was if there’s something they didn’t want to eat, I never forced them to eat things.  But what I did do, particularly with one of my sons who was very picky about what he’d eat, was make lists of what he liked—it was called John’s Delicious List, and I posted it on the refrigerator so that it would be there even if I wasn’t there, if there was a babysitter, things he really liked to eat.\n\nQ:  And what was on the list?\n\nZagat:  Lots of very good things.  He liked chicken, he liked bananas and apples.  I don’t remember exactly, but there was a good assortment of plenty of healthy things that were delicious to him.  So we just worked on expanding John’s Delicious List, and he’s a happy and healthy eater who’s in his third year at NYU Medical School now.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  It doesn’t sound like your mother—but correct me if I’m wrong—was susceptible to the frozen foods and shortcuts that came around after the war.\n\nZagat:  No, not really, although frozen vegetables I remember having, but I never remember other frozen things being served.\n\nQ:  Throughout our interview, your husband praised your cooking over and over again.  So tell me how you learned to cook and when that happened.\n\nZagat:  I think I learned to cook a lot from watching my grandmother and seeing how she went about the process and seeing the pleasure she got from doing it and sharing it.  So I think that’s the earliest point at which I became interested in cooking, but then I didn’t really cook at all, other than those summers, until I was in law school.  Now, perhaps there were some small things I did in between, but I really don’t remember any.  But then when I was in law school, I just started getting interested in cooking.  Part of it, I think, was the frustration of law school, because you’d really go through a term of studying contracts or torts.  At Yale, where everything’s done with the Socratic method and you’re not really totally on top of the subject till you get to the end and you’re able to put all the pieces together, you’re sort of in flux.  To me, it was enormously relaxing and gave me a great sense of accomplishment to set about making something that I would pick out to try.  These were things that I had never done before, and within a couple of hours you either had a great success or you didn’t.  It wasn’t really whether it was a success or not, although obviously I always like to succeed, but it was sort of knowing where you stood, whether you got it, whether you did it well in a compressed period of time.  That was a great relief in the context of law school.\n\nQ:  You were living in an apartment?\n\nZagat:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So you had a kitchen.\n\nZagat:  Yes.  I shared an apartment with a friend of mine from Vassar, who had gone to graduate school at Yale in English literature.  It was similar to what might be a floor in a brownstone here, so it had a quite nice-size kitchen, although not very well appointed, but it worked.\n\nQ:  In terms of where you got your recipes, did you teach yourself from books or from what you wanted to make or what?\n\nZagat:  I’d say, at that point, from books.  When I look back at them, some of the recipes I think now are just dreadful.  For example, I remember cooking some recipe that was in the New York Times Cookbook, Craig Claiborne, which was some kind of Polynesian chicken or something like that.  At the time, it was exotic, it was highly appreciated by the eaters, and was fine, I guess, made from good, wholesome ingredients, but certainly not something I’d be looking forward to having today.  In fact, maybe I should try it.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Those cookbooks tend to get short shrift, for whatever reasons, but they certainly introduced international cuisines to us, not necessarily the Polynesian one, in a way that Julia Child, of course, did not.  I think that those were very helpful books.\n\nZagat:  Oh, yes.  I liked Craig Claiborne’s book a lot and I enjoyed being able to tell him about the part he played in teaching me to cook, which he was happy about.  He was just a wonderful person and a great supporter to us as we got started in our business.  I learned a lot of things from that cookbook and also the very simple James Beard cookbook.  I forget what it’s called.\n\nQ:  I forget what it’s called, too, but there’s almost a primer—\n\nZagat:  It’s a sort of a small chunky kind of book and it’s very good.  I recommend that to people.  If you want to look up simple things like how long to bake a potato or to cook your beets or whatever, those things are very helpful.  Then I quickly moved on to Julia Child’s cookbook, which was very popular at the time.  It was just out, basically, at that time, and those recipes were, of course, much more complicated, but it was fun.  It was like taking a bit of a hike and trying out some of those recipes, which were terrific.\nBut the thing that I learned later on, when Tim and I lived in Paris in 1968 and ’69 and I studied at the Cordon Bleu, was how incredibly more complicated her recipes were than they needed to be, because when I was at the Cordon Bleu, I went to the demonstrations.  I didn’t sign up for a professional course there, but at the beginning of each month they would post the menus that would be done each day during the month, so I would pick each week the things that I wanted to learn how to make.  To be able to sit there and watch the chef make them, ask your questions, participate with everybody else in the class was really very interesting and lots of fun, and it was all in French, so I learned—\n\nQ:  I’m very impressed, yes.\n\nZagat:  I’d say I learned a lot of French there because I had incredible motivation to understand every single word that was being said, because I wanted to really understand how these things were done.\n\nQ:  Back up a little bit and just tell me about how you and Tim got together and then eventually got to go to Paris.\n\nZagat:  Tim and I met in our first year in law school.  We were at Yale.  There were four courses in your first term.  Three were large classes and then there was one that would be a small group.  Tim and I were in the same small group, and it was contracts, with an absolutely fabulous teacher, Grant Gilmore, who was a very dramatic person with a big handlebar mustache and a very [coughs] way of talking, and had been an admiralty lawyer and professor for many years.  That was really his specialty, but he had this small group that he was teaching contracts to.  He just was an incredibly well-educated, interesting, deep person to spend time with.  So he was great.  We had maybe ten people in our class, and Tim and I were two of them.\n\nQ:  Did you study together?\n\nZagat:  Yes, we started studying together, and we had other people that we’d study with, as well, not everybody from our little section.\n\nQ:  He told the story of—should I call it asking about getting married, and he said to ask you if it was the same version.  [laughter]\n\nZagat:  You mean his not asking me to get married.\n\nQ:  Exactly.  [laughter]  That’s why I was struggling for the word.\n\nZagat:  Well, let’s see.  So I would be doing this.  Cooking, Tim, of course, was a very happy participant and eater and so he would frequently be coming over.  I don’t remember what I was out doing, going to the library or something, and I came back and there was Tim studying.  I came in when he was on the phone with—I don’t remember whether it was my mother or his parents, telling them that we were going to get married.\n\nQ:  What did you say?  [laughter]\n\nZagat:  What can you say?  [laughter]  I mean, of course I was thrilled about the idea, but I was very sort of taken aback.  Ask Tiffany what it’s like.  Tiffany just got engaged in a dramatic way as well.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nZagat:  Well, anyway, so I came in and there was Tim on the phone, and so, I mean, I was taken aback.  Then it was interesting because we decided that we didn’t want to just get a normal engagement ring, that we wanted to design something ourselves.  An aunt of mine was an artist, so we asked her for some recommendations.  We went to New York and met a couple of these different people, and we found this woman that we really liked.  Her name was Irena Brynner; she was Yul Brynner’s sister.  We said what we liked in a design and talked about what kind of stones we’d like, and then she was going to figure out what it would cost and let us know.\nSo off we went.  We sort of had this image of what we liked.  Then she let us know, and it was more than we felt we could afford.  So I said it certainly didn’t matter to me.  “Let’s just get something simple,” and so we just left it at that.  Actually, when I think about the time period, it was really rather compressed because we only had six weeks.\n\nQ:  Between—\n\nZagat:  Yes, because when Tim was calling—\n\nQ:  —his not asking you and getting married.\n\nZagat:  —and not asking me, when Tim was on the phone with my mother—that was before I had gotten back—he had asked her, apparently, if she could do the wedding in four weeks, because Tim likes to get things done once he decides he wants to do something.  So she said she thought that was going to be a little short, could we maybe make it six weeks, which always makes me laugh because nowadays people are planning their weddings for a year, and I think, my god, how can you spend a year of your life?\nAnyway, so we had six weeks and we were in school.  I mean it wasn’t like we were able to roam around Madison Avenue looking at things and registries.  There was no registry.  So anyway, somehow or other in that time we went to see this woman.  We weren’t going to get the ring and we were just sort of letting it be out there.  Then all of a sudden, Tim and I went out to dinner at some very nice restaurant in New Haven, a little bit out of town, and when it came to dessert, there was this delicious dessert.  I can’t remember what it was.  But while I was eating the dessert, I came upon some tinfoil in the cake.  I said, “Tim, this is disgusting.  They left some of the tinfoil in the cake.  It’s a good thing I didn’t—.”\n\nQ:  Chomp it.  [laughter]\n\nZagat:  And Tim said, “Well, take a look at it.  See what it is.  Maybe there’s some reason there’s a tinfoil in the cake.”  [laughs]  I opened the tinfoil, and there was my ring.\n\nQ:  Oh, that’s beautiful.\n\nZagat:  See, we had designed a wedding band and an engagement ring that is separate but fit together as one.\n\nQ:  Oh, that’s beautiful.  And there it was.\n\nZagat:  There it was, yellow diamond and emeralds.\n\nQ:  That’s fabulous.  So presumably you moved in together rather quickly.\n\nZagat:  After we got married.  Well, Tim made a deal with my roommate that she could have his—it was during the middle of the year—that she would have his apartment for the rest of the year and he’d take hers.  People didn’t live together before they were married in those days.\n\nQ:  This was in your second or third year?\n\nZagat:  Second year.\n\nQ:  So you continued studying and, obviously, continued cooking.\n\nZagat:  Yes.\n\nQ:  And then after you graduated, what happened?\n\nZagat:  After we graduated, we came to New York, and shortly after, we started practicing law.  Tim’s firm asked him if he would go to Paris.  I remember Tim calling me and saying that the firm had asked him if he’d go to Paris.  And I said, “Fabulous. When are we going?”  They were going to give us something like a month to get ready to go to Europe.  Maybe it was a little bit longer, but it wasn’t a big advance time.  And Tim said, “Well, we’re not going to go if your firm doesn’t send you.  You’ve got to have a job there too.”\n\nQ:  How evolved of him.\n\nZagat:  And I said, “What are you talking about?  We’ll go to Paris.  We’ll figure it out.”\n\t“No, let’s make sure we get this done.”\n\tSo I said, “Okay.”  So then I tried to figure out this whole strategy of how I’d get my firm to agree to send me to Paris.  I mean, there were hardly any women practicing law at that time.\n\nQ:  What kind of a firm was it?\n\nZagat:  Sherman & Sterling, a big international law firm.\n\nQ:  International.  Good word, yes.\n\nZagat:  So anyway, we finally figured out our strategy, practiced my talk on a few friends, and the strategy was basically to go to this partner, who we had known from when we were in law school because he had come around to meet people.  Mike Forrestal is his name.  He was very involved in all of the international activities at Sherman & Sterling and knew me.  This was right at the beginning.  So I said, “Look, I have this problem.  Do you suppose that the firm would be able to find something for me to be able to do in the Paris office?”\n\tHe said, “No problem.  I’m sure we’ll figure it out, and if for some reason we can’t, then I’m sure we’ll be able to get you something at Citibank in Paris.” \n\nQ:  Oh, that’s amazing.\n\nZagat:  “Major client of the firm.  So don’t worry.”  So I mean it just all happened so fast and he was so understanding about the whole thing, that I was very excited, and off we went.  It was interesting because a friend of ours, where the husband also, a couple, the husband also worked at Sherman & Sterling, I think had been asked before this came up to go to the Paris office and it was sort of six months or so before he showed up, because it was more on a regular thing, whereas Hughes Hubbard [& Reed] needed Tim to go.  They didn’t have anybody extra in Paris.  It was a smaller firm in Paris, and so they needed him to go [right away].\n\tSo we spent the month before we went going to Berlitz, brushing up on our French.  Both of us had studied French before.  I had taken four years of French and four years of Latin.  So we just really worked on getting better, and off we went.  Kept our apartment.  The firm was going to pick up the apartment here because we were only being sent for six months.  So we just sort of packed our bags and went.  But six months turned into two years.  In the interim, the head of Tim’s firm ran into some marital issues and ended up asking if he could use our apartment while we were away, which, of course, was fine.  They were paying for it anyway.  Life just has these ways of moving along.\n\nQ:  Where were you living in Paris?\n\nZagat:  On the Left Bank, Rue de l’Odéon.\n\nQ:  Were you cooking?  Were you eating out?\n\nZagat:  We cooked somewhat, but mostly eating out.  But it was, I mean, a fabulous place to live.  Do you know where Rue de l’Odéon is?\n\nQ:  Tell me where it is.\n\nZagat:  It’s in the sixth arrondissement, the street coming right down from the Odéon Theater to Boulevard Saint-Germain, and right across Saint-Germain was a wonderful market on Rue de Seine, so we’d be able to buy these fabulous roasted ducks and all different kinds of delicious things and bring them back to the apartment.  It was great.\n\nQ:  And you could afford to eat out when you wanted to do that?\n\nZagat:  Well, in Paris you can always eat at any price range.  Not, of course, if you’re looking in certain fancy guidebooks, but certainly in ours and for us, we were always able to find things to do.  But also a lot of the job of a young lawyer in a major law firm in Paris is handling the extra entertaining that the head of the firm would have no chance of being able to find the time to do.  So that was a responsibility we were very happy to take on and led us to start keeping our restaurant list.\n\nQ:  Why did you do that?\n\nZagat:  The restaurant list?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nZagat:  Because we wanted to be sure that when we got called up and asked to take somebody out to dinner or lunch or whatever, that we would know what places everybody was saying we should try or know about and experiment, try new things.  We wanted to do everything.  We had six months, and we had to figure out how we were going to cram every bit of knowledge about Paris and Europe and life into that period of time.  So in addition to our work, I was taking courses at the Cordon Bleu, we were going off every weekend in a different direction, and we were totally free.  We had no children.  So one weekend we’d go to Brittany, another weekend we’d go to Alsace, another weekend we’d go to the Loire River Valley.  We were going all over the place.  And being there, everybody wanted to come visit us, so we’d always have friends or business relationships, people that would want to go different directions with us.  We just had a wonderful, wonderful time.  You have to remember it was a very special period of time too.\n\nQ:  Tell me what you mean.\n\nZagat:  Barely had we arrived in Paris in 1968 than it was les événements, which reached their culmination, as I recall, in May.  We had arrived in February.\n\nQ:  In the winter, yes.\n\nZagat:  So it was a dramatic time for France and for us.\n\nQ:  Do you recall what those notes looked like?\n\nZagat:  Notes?\n\nQ:  The notes that you were taking on the restaurants.\n\nZagat:  Oh, sure.  We created what ultimately, in my mind, has always been the beginning of what we do now.\n\nQ:  Did you discuss what kinds of things you wanted to put in your notes or what?\n\nZagat:  Well, it was a very organized format.  It’s basically a model for what we ended up doing later.  That was really based on us and just a few friends and general information that we got from everybody we’d meet [and all of the existing guides to Paris restaurants], but it had the same kind of organization that became what we did as the first surveys.\n\nQ:  Was that you or Tim or what, that orderly sense of—\n\nZagat:  I think pretty much both of us.  My office at Sherman & Sterling ended up being the library because there weren’t any extra offices and it was sort of the middle space in the office, so I’d be meeting everybody as they came and went.  I remember keeping this list and everybody coming and asking questions, of course, because everybody was interested in the same thing, where to go.\n\nQ:  That’s interesting, so that you were writing down the kinds of things that people might ask you about, whether it was the décor or the cost or—I mean, you tell me.\n\nZagat:  We had this format, and as we’d learn of places, we’d add them to the list.  What we did was basically initially keep a record of what all the different guides at the time said about each of the places, so that it was a list that we’d keep adding to based on what people told us, and then we’d have what the Michelin Guide said, what Kléber-Colombes said, what Gault Millau and other guides said.  Then in the right-hand column, we’d put some miscellaneous information like “Vietnamese” or just random information that we got.\n\nQ:  Are you a very orderly person?\n\nZagat:  About certain kinds of things, extremely orderly, but other kinds of things, not.\n\nQ:  But this was one of those things.\n\nZagat:  Yes.\n\nQ:  I guess what I’m getting at is, presumably they were not just your friends, but business contacts—\n\nZagat:  Oh, absolutely.\n\nQ:  —who would ask questions.  So you had to provide information on a whole range of things that people might ask.  Is that right?\n\nZagat:  Here.\n\nQ:  Let’s see.  This physically represents what?  What am I looking at here?\n\nZagat:  You’re looking at not the beginning, not a 1968 version, but what evolved to be the ’74, ’75 version of what we called the Guide des Guides, the Guide of the Guides, Zagat’s Paris Guide des Guides.  We had the list of the restaurants with their addresses and phone numbers, what we and our friends thought, what the Michelin Guide said, Kleber, Gault Millau, George Balkind, a friend of ours who was in Tim’s office in Paris.  We indicated the price in dollars, I see, price range based on exchange rate of 4.8 francs to the dollar, and some comments.\n\nQ:  And these numbers are what?\n\nZagat:  The numbers are the numbers that we used in some form.  I mean we translated it.  For example, the Michelin Guide doesn’t use a number two, but I’m sure that meant two stars, one star, zero stars, etc.\n\nQ:  So essentially this is stars, although you get into larger—\n\nZagat:  Numbers.  Gault Millau was on a different scale.\n\nQ:  But since they all are referenced at the top, it was clear—\n\nZagat:  What was what, yes.  So here we were getting a look at one, two, three of the major guides at the time, plus our friends.  There’s a little map of Paris, 102 places.  We’d have to read through this to remember.\n\nQ:  This is explanatory.  Maybe you could get me a copy of this.  That would be interesting.\n\nZagat:  And then we also gave the names of some places out of town that people would enjoy.  But then also, it’s not on this, but we have another one where we used to keep a list of, if you were in Paris for five days, places you might like to go.  We had a bunch of different ways of looking at it.  Intellectually, this is the beginning of the Guide.  I mean, it’s different in that it’s not based on a survey of hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of people as time has evolved.  The major innovation with our first New York City restaurant survey was the decision that it really should be based on lots of people who eat out a lot, savvy diners who are passionate about going out to restaurants and want to share their experiences.\n\nQ:  Let’s go back to this one for a second.  You were there for two years.\n\nZagat:  Right, but then we kept going back afterwards, so we kept this up long after we were living there.  We left Paris in ’69, so this is five years later.\n\nQ:  And when you made up this list, did you give copies of it to—\n\nZagat:  Oh, sure.  We gave copies to anybody who wanted them, and with our New York City Restaurant Guide, when we started that, we also gave copies to anybody who wanted it.  We were never doing it as a business.  We weren’t doing it to make money.\n\nQ:  But you’re lawyers, so it didn’t occur to you to in some way protect your information or—\n\nZagat:  We did.  We copyrighted it.\n\nQ:  When did you do that?\n\nZagat:  Well, each edition we’d copyright each time we did it.\n\nQ:  And the first edition that had the copyright, do you have any idea—\n\nZagat:  I’m sure it was 1968.\n\nQ:  No kidding.\n\nZagat:  Now, you don’t have to formally register the copyright, so I don’t think you’re going to find it.\n\nQ:  But it intimidates people from stealing.\n\nZagat:  Yes, but it also protects it.  You basically declare your copyright in something.\n\nQ:  So you came back in ’70? \n\nZagat:  Sixty-nine.  We came back.  At that time, this was a hardship post.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Which one?  New York or Paris?\n\nZagat:  Paris.  So we got paid extra to be in Paris.  I mean the whole thing was so ludicrous to us.  [laughs]  I mean to me particularly.  I just kept thinking, oh, my goodness, I’d practically pay to be there if I could afford it.  And then you come back first class on the France.\n\nQ:  Very nice.\n\nZagat:  Yes, that’s what one did in those days, and so that meant all the things that you bought in Paris, the copper pots and little pieces of furniture and whatever you acquired, and a nice collection of wine, because anybody who was going back would be putting together a big stack of wine that they’d send on the ship with them.  This was all—\n\nQ:  Pretty good for two kids.  That’s really wonderful.\n\nZagat:  [laughs] There we were, children in Paris.  It was just great.  But I mean the whole drama of France’s crisis at that time was dramatic as well.  Tim was always anxious to get into the middle of things, so if we’d find out that there was a major altercation on Boulevard Saint-Michel, off we’d be going to see what was happening.  And then you’d end up having to race once the police started coming, and these were not gentle situations.  Thank God I never fell down, because you’d just get trampled.  Our metro station was Odéon, and as we’d be coming towards Odéon, for a long period of time, tear gas would be coming right down into the subway, into the metro.  So you’d sort of learn how not to get knocked out from the tear gas as you got into the station, had to get up, find your way to the apartment while there were these CRS trucks at the corner with these guys with [big black round shields]—I forget what they’re called.\n\nTim Zagat:  Don’t believe anything she says.  [laughter]\n\nZagat:  Tim, what are they called?\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  This is Judy Weinraub.  This is a continuation of my interview with Nina Zagat.  Go ahead.\n\nZagat:  So there’d be these CRFs and these buses all along Boulevard Saint-Germain coming up Odéon.  When they were out, they had these big shields, black.  I think they were all sort of some kind of heavy metal and scary kinds of helmets, and you knew that they would do whatever was required to settle any kind of unrest, and there was unrest everywhere.\n\nQ:  This was presumably daytime stuff?  I just can’t remember.\n\nZagat:  Well, the pace would usually pick up in the evening.  I mean, when we’d be in our apartment, we’d hear these horns and all kinds of noises and things happening, and then the students were in the Odéon Theater having discussions and dramas going on, I mean personal dramas of what to do.  So it was just a dramatic time to be in Paris.\n\tThen we ended up spending some time in London because we’d go off occasionally to London for a weekend.  For one of these trips, things were really picking up in Paris and we had to leave from Le Bourget Airport, the military airport, and then go into London.\n\tWe would call and said, “Should we get back?  They’re saying there aren’t any flights.” \n\tMy office said, “Look, do me a favor.  Stay in London.  We’ll tell you when to come back.  We don’t need anybody extra to worry about.  Just be safe.  Have a good time.”\n\tOf course, our families, reading about all this in the papers here, were thinking that it was much more dangerous than it was.  It wouldn’t have been so dangerous if we weren’t running into the middle of everything all the time and partly because of where we lived.\n\nQ:  It certainly seemed dangerous at the time.  And so meanwhile, there you are.  You’re taking classes at the Cordon Bleu, you’re both working, and you’re managing to do your eating out and cooking and everything else, and it all came together somehow.\n\nZagat:  Yes.  So on top of these riots all the time, they would turn off all the water and electricity, except during lunchtime.  The French, you know, they have to have their lunch.  So when you’d be at the office, the electricity would be off the telex, which is what you used at the time.  That was before fax.  The telex wouldn’t work.  Nothing would work.  Just somehow managed to muddle through.\nWe’d fill the bathtub with water in the morning because it might be the only water you’d get.  [laughs]  Then it was very interesting because you’d go to the markets and you’d go—well, I mean, it was just these amazing things started happening.  You’d look at the shelf in the supermarket where the oil was; all gone.  Sugar, gone.  I mean all of it.\n\nQ:  People were stocking up?\n\nZagat:  Yes, people went back to the mentality of the war, and the things they couldn’t get in the war were gone.  I mean, before, somebody like me would even think about buying an extra pound of sugar.  It was very educational.\n\nQ:  What brought you back eventually?\n\nZagat:  Here?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nZagat:  Well, our time was up, and I think if we had stayed any longer, our lives would have begun to shift and we would have ended up starting to have a family [in France] and would have stayed.  Some of our friends did.  But I think for Tim particularly, a lot happened while we were away.  Until you start thinking about it, you forget.  Martin Luther King [Jr.] was shot.  Bobby Kennedy.  We landed on the moon.  I remember sitting there watching the moon landing in Paris from our little tiny TV.  A lot of things that happened during that time that were very dramatic, and for people who are very interested in politics and the whole political process, it’s difficult to be someplace where you can’t be a participant.\nFor us, for a while, when Sargent Shriver was the ambassador, and Tim had worked for Sarg when he had been in the Peace Corps, so we had a lot of connections with people at the embassy, both through that and also through the law firms and things, so that we were very tuned into a lot of things that made you feel part of the system.  But still, you were out of it.\n\nQ:  So you came back, and did you go back to the kinds of jobs you had before at your firms?\n\nZagat:  Yes.\n\nQ:  And what made you start taking notes on restaurants here?\n\nZagat:  There came a time when we were still eating out a lot, meeting our friends.  We’d be thinking about—it’s five o’clock.  A friend calls up and says, “Well, let’s meet for dinner.”  Where to go?  There wasn’t something here like our Paris restaurant list.  So we were members of a wine-tasting group, and everybody was commiserating about the fact that nobody really trusted the critics and that we would all rely on word of mouth.\n\nQ:  Why was that?\n\nZagat:  Because I think as we all were reading various critics, we didn’t feel the same way about various places, plus they were these long-winded things, which were—I shouldn’t perhaps say it quite that way, but the fact is that, for us, the kind of information we wanted was very targeted to certain pieces of information.  We didn’t think that you needed to read about how the sauce was made for a certain dish or what music you were hearing in the background to decide if it was a place you wanted to try.  Our criteria were different, and we’d want to be able to think of places in various parts of town, or maybe we’d feel like having Chinese food, or maybe it was a business dinner and you wanted to be sure that it was something very elegant.  We wanted to be able to have the same ease of getting information that we had from our Paris Guide des Guides and it didn’t exist.\n\nQ:  So then what?\n\nZagat:  So we ended up doing it.\n\nQ:  How did that come about?\n\nZagat:  Well, it started at our wine-tasting group when we were having this discussion about the critics [that they didn’t provide] the kind of information we were really looking for, that we needed information that was more relevant to what we were looking for so that it would either be a part of town, a type of cuisine, romantic, elegant, whatever, and different things all the time, business lunch, business breakfast, the kinds of things that young professionals were looking for when they wanted to make a decision about where to go.  It just didn’t exist, and so Tim had suggested that we do a survey among all the members of our wine-tasting group and friends of friends and expand the group of people who participated in this.\n\nQ:  When you say wanted to do a survey, physically how did that work?  \n\nZagat:  We all had pads of paper to write [our comments about] the wine, whatever the theme was, whether we were doing a vertical tasting of certain wines or whatever it was.  We’d be keeping our own ratings.  And Tim said, “Well, let’s rate the restaurants.”  So we ended up doing a form.\n\nQ:  The two of you?\n\nZagat:  Yes, and asking members of our wine-tasting group and their friends and friends of friends to participate, and just put it all together.  But it ended up looking very much like that.\n\nQ:  But they would send these pieces of paper back to you?\n\nZagat:  Yes.\n\nQ:  And did you put them together?  Did the two of you put them together?\n\nZagat:  We got somebody to input all the information.  You had to print up the questionnaires, send them out to people or leave bunches of them at the reception desk, say, in our law firm or whatever, and people would fill them in.  Then we’d get them back and have somebody take off all the information.  Then that information would come back, and we’d put together a form similar to that, just two sheets, two sides of a sheet of paper.  It started off more simply and then it got more involved as we started to have more indexes, more lists of things in the front of the guide.  But even before there was a guide, I think if you pull down the first version of the survey, we also had lists.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  The pieces of paper that came back had a lot of information on it, so that—\n\nZagat:  We made copies of what we wanted people to fill in.  It was a form.\n\nQ:  After the information was, as it were, downloaded, who put the whole thing together into a form that was usable?  The two of you?\n\nZagat:  No.  Tim had somebody do it outside.  I don’t remember who did it.  But that whole process started getting expensive because it started to get very popular.  More and more people wanted to fill in the questionnaire.  We wanted more and more people to fill in the questionnaire.\n\nQ:  You mean just setting it up, the paper, the getting it all around was expensive?\n\nZagat:  Mailing them, getting them back, having them data-processed, having it all printed up.  Everybody wanted copies.  Making more copies and more copies and sending them out got to be expensive.  So at a certain point I said, “Well, we ought to figure out how we’re going to break even on this,” because this was all after-tax money.  It was just a hobby.  It’s like going out to play golf.  Some of our friends were playing golf; we were putting together restaurant surveys.\n\nQ:  So how did you rectify that?\n\nZagat:  Well, we decided to go around and speak to various publishers to see who would be interested in publishing our guide.  We put it into a form to publish, and we went around to lots and lots of publishers and they all uniformly turned us down.  At Sherman & Sterling, we represented Doubleday, Scribner, Forbes.\n\nQ:  These were your clients?\n\nZagat:  Yes, but I mean, we weren’t above asking people to go talk to their clients and see if they would want to talk to us about the Guide.  [laughs]\nTim, at that point, was at Gulf & Western.  Simon & Schuster was part of the business and there was another publishing firm as well, and everybody turned us down.  Tim’s uncle had started Atheneum, a publisher, and they did the New York Times Restaurant Guide.  Tim’s uncle explained that sales of the New York Times Restaurant Guide were not much, so why did we think ours would sell?  Other people said that it was a ridiculous idea.  Who cared what other people thought?  People wanted to know what experts thought.  Then other people said the whole concept, the format, was ridiculous, the reviews weren’t long enough and all these numbers and things.  We heard every reason in the world.\n\tWe had dinner with Tim Forbes the other night, and he said that he remembered that the head lawyer for them at Sherman & Sterling at the time had spoken to his father about it.  He said, “You realize why my father turned it down.”\n\tAnd I said, “No.”\n\tAnd he said, well, he had done his own restaurant guide, and apparently it hadn’t done much.\n\tSo we just decided we’d do it ourselves, and that was the best thing that ever happened because had we been lucky enough to get one of these publishers to publish our guide, we’d be getting a 10 percent royalty or something.\n\nQ:  It must have been somewhat expensive to capitalize, yes?\n\nZagat:  Well, sure, it was expensive for us to do it, but for us, it was turning an after-tax expenditure into a pre-tax expenditure.  We were, at that point, turning it into what might be a business, although that wasn’t what we were about.  It wasn’t why we were doing it.  We were just trying to make sure we were covering our expenses, and then all of a sudden it just caught on and everybody had interest in it.\n\nQ:  You are a tax attorney.\n\nZagat:  I have been.  Not now.\n\nQ:  That was what your job was.\n\nZagat:  It was a broad range of responsibilities for individual clients, so everything from taxes to estate planning, private foundations, all kinds of things.\n\nQ:  So how long did it take to get it together and actually self-publish?\n\nZagat:  Not long, because we already had set up the process of doing the legal sheets of paper.  So we found somebody to typeset and turn it into a small guide in a different format than it had been before.  I don’t remember exactly how long it took, but the first guides came out in November of ’82, with an ’83 cover.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nZagat:  You’ll see it’s a very small little guide.\n\nQ:  And how did you market it?\n\nZagat:  We got boxes back from the printer.  We didn’t think about the next stage till we were in it, because we were busy making a living.  So we got these boxes of books.  We had to figure out what to do, so we stuck them in the back of our station wagon and went up and down Madison and Lexington and went into bookstores and asked if they wouldn’t like to carry our books.  Of course, some of them looked at us like we were absolutely nuts.  Others said, “Sure, we’ll try them out.”  The ones that were nice enough to support us, if they ran out of books, we’d be hopping in a cab and going to get them to them in the middle of a snowstorm.\n\nQ:  How did you choose the color?\n\nZagat:  I remember our looking at a bunch of different colors.  I’ve always been fond of a burgundy color.  It also seemed like a good color for what we were doing, and we just went with it.  Tim and I both liked the color.\n\nQ:  Presumably, if you had a station wagon, you probably had children at that point too.\n\nZagat:  We had one.  Well, no, I guess we had two, but I remember Ted coming around in the station wagon because—let’s see.  It was ’82.  Ted was born in ’75, so he was seven years old.  John was younger.\n\nQ:  Were you living in the city at that point?\n\nZagat:  Yes, we were living in the city for the whole time, other than when we lived in Paris after law school.\n\nQ:  Did you redo it every year?  How did that work?\n\nZagat:  Oh, yes, and I remember the first year.  I mean, it was just excruciatingly difficult getting it all done.  We were both thinking, or at least I was thinking, well, this will be a breeze next year because we did it this year and sort of worked out all the kinks.  Well, it was never a breeze.  To this day it’s not a breeze, because there are always so many new things happening, and we always want to be sure we’ve got every exciting new thing in the Guide.  Of course, on zagat.com, it’s no longer a one-time-a-year project.  Now it’s all the time, and not just New York, but cities all over the world.\n\nQ:  I was going to ask you about that.  So for the first few years you stayed with the New York guide, yes?\n\nZagat:  Yes.\n\nQ:  In ’87 you had Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and D.C.\n\nZagat:  Yes, but in ’86 we added the New York City Marketplace Survey.\n\nQ:  What was that?\n\nZagat:  It’s something that was a precursor to the Food Lover’s Guide that I hope Tiffany has given you a copy of.\n\nQ:  And why did you want to do that, the Marketplace Survey?\n\nZagat:  I think the reason, as best I can recall, is that I kept lists of all these places that I would go to, and then we decided, well, let’s turn that into another guide, similar thing, similar process, but for a different subject area.\n\nQ:  And did you distribute the questionnaires or whatever to the same kinds of people?\n\nZagat:  Yes.  Yes, exactly, and then the next year we added Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.\n\nQ:  And what made you do that, reach out?  That was a big step.  You had to find more people and—\n\nZagat:  Well, we had to find some people in each of those cities, but we called on people we knew, or friends of friends.  We had one person who would get lots of people engaged in the process and one who we called a coordinator and one person who was very familiar with the local restaurants, either because they were a food critic or through some other reason, and we had them editing the comments that came in from the surveyors.\n\nQ:  Did people ever vie to become reviewers?\n\nZagat:  We were happy to have anybody who was really passionate about the subject participate, so people wanted to become reviewers.\n\nQ:  So you coordinated that—you, plural—in New York, and the people that you hired coordinated it in other cities?\n\nZagat:  Yes, we’d be coordinating them in other cities.\n\nQ:  And was there a number of people that you felt you had to have before you felt you could give a reasonably secure view of the restaurants?\n\nZagat:  There always has been.  I don’t remember at that moment in time what we were thinking.  In fact, we can look in this guide to see if we had a little triangle.  I don’t know that we did that then.  We had an asterisk following the name, meaning the survey basis deemed too low to be statistically reliable.\n\nQ:  Tell me when you decided to go into this full-time and how that happened.\n\nZagat:  Well, it happened over a period of time, but I think it was in late ’89 or early ’90 that I started doing it full-time, and I think Tim started doing it full-time in ’87.  I think that’s why we were able to add the additional cities.\n\nQ:  And you did that why?  Because you thought it was good business?\n\nZagat:  Because we needed to.  You mean that Tim started doing it?\n\nQ:  No, the expansion.  What made you go into other cities?\n\nZagat:  Because New York was doing extremely well, and we felt it would be relevant in other cities, and why not.  Also, we were making money in New York, and so we figured we might as well invest that in expanding the business in other cities.  So we were never looking at this as a way for us to be taking money out; we were looking at building a business at that point.  Once we decided we were going to do it as a business, then we wanted to really build it up.\n\nQ:  Was there a specific time in which the two of you thought, “Okay, this is what we’ll do and eventually we’ll leave our practices”?\n\nZagat:  Well, I think really in ’87 it was a matter of ‘this is really happening.’  Either we’ve got to pay attention to this and help it grow, nurture this business and really devote the time that it needs, or we’ve got to stop doing it, because you can’t do everything.  So I think that was the primary impetus then.  It was really deciding, okay, are we going to turn this into a real business or not, and we decided that we were going to turn it into a real business.\n\nQ:  Was that a scary decision?\n\nZagat:  No, I wouldn’t say scary.  I mean, serious, yes, thoughtful, but certainly not something at that point that we were both going to just quit our jobs and do.  Also, I was so involved at that point in some things that I couldn’t just drop, that we decided I would keep doing what I was doing and Tim would do the survey.  Also, I mean, I spent a lot of time still doing it.  I remember I’d have conference rooms filled with boxes of books.  Everybody at the office was very supportive of this whole burgeoning little business that they all felt a part of in some way.  Everybody participated in the survey and loved the idea.\n\nQ:  When did you start hiring a staff?\n\nZagat:  You know, I don’t remember.  I think we must have had a couple of people in 1987.  I can’t be sure that we had [unclear] a little bit earlier than that, but I think early in ’87.\n\nQ:  Would those couple of people have participated in editing or amassing the information?\n\nZagat:  I know there was one person who was responsible for all the bookkeeping and there was someone who was responsible for going around to bookstores, taking care of these customers that we began to develop.  I think extra editorial people at that time were more part-time.  I don’t think we had anybody who really was working full-time on editorial, but I could be wrong.  I don’t remember.  Certainly in the other cities we did.\n\nQ:  Have staffs.\n\nZagat:  Well, had two people who were not formally staff, but were working on a contract basis the way we still do it in other cities, where people work on the particular project, whether it’s putting together all the information for an annual review or whether it’s providing information to zagat.com, because the business, over this time, has evolved, and now the primary focus really is on developing zagat.com, growing it, growing all of our different mobile applications.  We’ve had the highest grossing travel app for the iPhone.  We have apps for Android, both free and paid apps.\n\nQ:  I’m sorry, both what?\n\nZagat:  A free app that’s simple and a paid app that’s similar to our iPhone app.  We’ve got Zagat.mobi, which is our mobile website, and all of these areas of expansion are becoming really the future for the business.  We do a lot of content licensing for things that consumers would know, for example, in-car navigation systems and for all different kinds of special projects for companies.\n\tWe grew on the book side from having these simple guides to starting to do gold-stamped guides for corporations, where we’d imprint their logo on them, to custom guides, which I’m sure Tim showed you, where we’d put a company’s whole branding, whatever they provided to us for branding on a particular project, on the cover and use information inside, either that exists for us by putting together a variety of different cities and different verticals.  It might have information about nightlife and restaurants and hotels, or it may be totally customized information, where we do the surveying specially for a company.\n\nQ:  What kind of survey?\n\nZagat:  Well, all different kinds.  I’m trying to think of ones that were done for custom projects.  We’ve done a lot of work for foreign governments.  The government of Barbados wanted to have a Zagat Guide to Barbados, and we said, well, we would love to help them.  It wasn’t in our own business plan to be doing Barbados, but that we do do special surveying if they’d like us to do it in the same way that we do our other content, that we’d have total editorial control, then we’d be happy to do surveying there and to turn out a guide as a project that they would pay us for.  When we spoke to them about it, we said, “Look, you’ve got to realize that when we do this, there will be places that are unhappy.  Some places will get good ratings; some places won’t.”\n\tThey said, “Great.  We think it will help tourism in Barbados to have people working towards improving their ratings.”  So we’ve done that for several years for them.\n\nQ:  In terms of the development of the business and the steps that you took, has it been the two of you, a board?  How is it set up?\n\nZagat:  Well, of course we have a board of directors.  The two of us are members of the board and Tim is the CEO.\n\nQ:  What does the board actually advise you on or do?\n\nZagat:  It’s the same as any board of directors for a business.  We meet regularly and discuss what’s going on, and get input from very creative, intelligent people who are a little bit more objective in that they’re not in the business every day and are wise advisors.\n\nQ:  So when these decisions to take a new direction or an additional direction take place, is that done in conjunction with the board or do you have the authority to make these decisions yourself?  I’m just curious to know how it works.  This is not a trick question.  [laughs]\n\nZagat:  I’m trying to think of how to answer you.  I don’t think it ever comes down to a question of do you have the authority to do this.  I think if we’re going to go in a totally different direction, then we really value getting input from people that we trust, admire, and know our business because they have been on the board for a long time and know everything that’s going on at a high level.  So it’s not a question of authority or no authority.  It’s the same way as when we have meetings.  I can’t think of any time we’ve ever taken a vote.  You have a discussion about things and you come to consensus.\n\nQ:  You’ve obviously been eating out, shopping, everything all the time during the time that you’ve had this.  How has the restaurant scene or attitudes toward food developed as you’ve been a part of that world?  I realize that’s a big question, but what have you seen in New York, for example?\n\nZagat:  Well, I’d say there’s been a revolutionary change in what’s been available in restaurants.  When I think back to the types of restaurants that existed in 1982 and what’s happening today, the variety, even within French restaurants, I mean, French restaurants were always here, but not like the French restaurants we have today.  We have over a hundred cuisine types in New York?\n\nTiffany:  Over a hundred.\n\nZagat:  So that there were just people from all over the world coming to New York, having restaurants that are more and more sophisticated in their own national cuisines.  There’s just an incredible breadth of places to go to, and our goal is always to make sure that we provide people with all the information to make a smart decision so that if they feel like experimenting, they can have the information to experiment with Ethiopian cuisine, Afghan cuisine, not just French, Italian, and all the ones that we readily think of.\n\nQ:  In terms of how this affected your lives, what did it mean?  Were you eating out more?  Did it just take over your life?\n\nZagat:  We’ve always been eating out a lot, so I don’t think it’s so much of a change there.  I think it’s a matter of its being a huge opportunity for us, because here we were trying to provide more information to people, to give people the power to make the right decision for themselves, not saying, as a restaurant critic would, “I’ve been to this restaurant and I think you must go and try their chicken,” or whatever.  It’s a very different perspective.\n\tWe read the critics and I enjoy reading criticism, but it’s different.  Here we’ve set ourselves a goal of being able to give people all this information in a way that will be accessible to them, and look what happens, the number of restaurants, the excellence of restaurants, the incredible availability of ingredients, the people’s travel has expanded so much, and just all these different factors, people’s interest in learning more about food, people’s excitement about learning more about sustainable food and all the ecological concerns that are becoming more and more prevalent, people understanding the importance of the ingredients and knowing about them.  All of these factors were happening in an area that we were passionate about and wanted to help people navigate, and so it just made it more and more exciting for us.  Of course, we’ve also been expanding into other verticals as well, but this is where we started, and it’s the area that we have covered more than any other.\n\nQ:  Did you make money from the beginning?  How did that work?\n\nZagat:  From the time that we were no longer doing it as a hobby, yes.\n\nQ:  How would you characterize that in terms of the other products, whether it was marketplace surveys or nightlife or whatever?  Are they financially successful?\n\nZagat:  Yes, I think that it depends on—I can’t think of any that have not been.  They’re all movies, music.  There are some that we’ve experimented with, and we thought we want to spend more time on this; we think it’s worth putting more energy into.  And others we’ve experimented with and said, “Okay, this is good, but we want to go in a different direction.”  We’ve always wanted to be very flexible and nimble and try different things, as, for example, again, with the mobile applications.  Who knows which one of these mobile applications is going to end up being the one that, five years from now, becomes the standard?  But you want to try them all, see which ones develop, which end up being the ones that are the bigger successes.\n\nQ:  Do you know when you started working with those apps?\n\nZagat:  I’d say we started working with them the very first time in 1999 when we were approached by NTT from Japan.\n\nQ:  What’s that?\n\nZagat:  —I forget whether it’s Nippon Telephone & Telegraph.  The Japanese phone company came to us before they launched the iMode, which was a revolutionary phone.  It’s the precursor of all the different phones that we’ve got now.  They came to us, a delegation from Japan, and they said they were coming out with a new technology, they couldn’t tell us anything about it, but that it was going to be a dramatic change, and that they felt that it would facilitate adoption by people of using their new technology if there was something on it that they really wanted.  They said, “We think the answer is Zagat Survey.  Would you do a Zagat Survey for us in Tokyo so that we can put it on the iMode?”\n\tWe said, what kind of arrangement would they propose?  And they said, “We’ll cover all your expenses.”\n\tSo we said, “Great.  We’ll try it.”  So we did this survey of Tokyo in Japanese.  They helped us meet some people that we’d be able to work with in Japan.\n\nQ:  You sent somebody over to do this?\n\nZagat:  No, no, no.  We worked with a company there, gave them all the questionnaires, worked with them on how to do it all, and then it came back here and we worked with our group here to put it all together, and that content went up on the iMode.  I’m not saying that was the driver, but iMode became this incredibly important mobile phone.  Let’s see.  Why am I forgetting what NTT DOCOMO became?  I guess NTT spun off, NTT DOCOMO, and it ended up going public and this was its product.\n\nQ:  In terms of the products that are more familiar today or the services that are more familiar today, when did that become a big part of your business?\n\nZagat:  I can’t remember when we first did our first mobile site.  The Zagat Taxi, I think, was in 1992.\n\nQ:  What is that?\n\nZagat:  It’s a software, mapping software that we did with another company that integrated our content, so that was even earlier.  So we’ve done all different kinds of—because Zagat to Go for the iPhone, etc., is really—it’s all an evolution.\n\nQ:  Approximately what percentage of your employees now are working in some way or other on these mobile applications rather than—\n\nZagat:  Everybody, in a sense, because it’s all the same material.  We create the content and then the content is deployed to mobile devices, to zagat.com.  We create the content through zagat.com because people now, rather than voting on pieces of paper that we circulate all over town, come to zagat.com to vote.  Rather than sending it out to a data processing firm to have thousands and thousands of questionnaires input by typists, now it’s all automatic because when you vote on zagat.com, it’s already input.  It’s a revolutionary change in the nature of the business.\n\nQ:  In terms of your own staff here, do you have technical people that produce these applications or do you work with various companies?\n\nZagat:  Both.  We have technical staff here that do zagat.com, and then we work with other companies on creating actual apps for the iPhone and for the Android.  So we work together.  We provide the content.  We discuss the design and work with them on that, and they do the heavy lifting on the technology part of it, but the technology for zagat.com, we do right here.\n\nQ:  Everybody has had to downsize recently, which I’m sure was difficult here.  Did you find that you downsized more with the technical people or with content people or writers, editors?\n\nZagat:  I think that we looked at the business as a whole and tried to figure out what areas we had more staff than we really needed for particular things that we were doing at the time.\n\nQ:  I’m just curious in terms of the evolution of, I guess, how information is accessed by people, whether the staff now is more weighted toward the internet and mobile world than it is toward books.\n\nZagat:  I’d say that it is because everybody in editorial is working on the mobile products and the web products as well.  It’s not like editorial is working on putting out books.  They’re creating the content that gets used everywhere.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n PAGE   \\* MERGEFORMAT 46\n\n\n\n\n","description":"Nina Zagat is the co-founder and co-chair of the Zagat Survey.

His mother's only food passion involved freezing foodsâ€”both before or after cooking. Her freezing habit was so strong that marked and dated packages retrieved from her freezer much later on could be identified as the 1955 Thanksgiving turkey or the 1957 Easter ham. The food Tim Zagat ate at school wasn't much better. \"Chicken a la King was a high point,\" he recalls. But his father and grandfather, who liked fine dining, set the stage for the future by taking the young man to some of the best restaurants of the 50s.\r\n\r\nAfter a few post-college years when he considered a life of politics and public service, Tim Zagat went to Yale Law School. There his home-cooked culinary world opened up when he met and married classmate, and good cook, Nina Safronoff.TTT\nInterviewee:  Tim Zagat\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t      New York City\nDate:  December 3, 2009\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  I’m with Tim Zagat in his office on Columbus Circle.  It is December 3, 2009.  Good afternoon.\n\nZagat:  Good to be with you.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we start with your telling me a little something about where and when you were born, how you grew up, your education, anything you feel.\n\nZagat:  I was born on May 13, 1940, before the Second World War had started, at least to the United States.  My mother and father were both New Yorkers and had grown up in New York.  My mother was originally from Alabama, in Montgomery, Alabama.  My father was originally from New York City.  My parents agreed on virtually nothing, but they negotiated everything.  My father wanted to have a son named after him, and so my real name is Eugene Henry Zagat, Jr., but my mother said that she wanted to be able to scream at us both and have us know who was being screamed at, so she said that she wanted to have the choice of my nickname.  So I was born Eugene formally, but my first week of life I was Nick Zagat.  That didn’t stick, at least with her, and then the second week I was Henry or Hank, and the third week of life I became Tim Zagat and that was that.\n\tI grew up on Central Park West at 94th Street, in apartment 10F, and I haven’t gone very far since then because I still live on Central Park West in another building but also in apartment 10F.  When I was a little boy, I first went to Alexander Robertson School, which was just a charming really miniscule school.\n\nQ:  I don’t know what that is.\n\nZagat:  It’s a church school, first Scotch Presbyterian, I think, or anyway, church school.  It was right on 95th Street, and I started when I was two years old and loved it.  My sister started two years later, when she was two years old.  We would go out to Central Park and had all kinds of good times in the park and loved it.\nMy parents didn’t like the same things when it came to where to live.  My father liked New York City, so we lived in New York for about five months a year, and my mother liked Stamford, Connecticut, where we had a house, we lived there for five months a year.  My mother liked exotic trips, so we would go to places like Guatemala and Haiti, and my father liked non-exotic trips where he could sit and read and eat, so we would go to places that were very comfortable when it was his month.  But we did travel more than, I think, most people.\n\tWhen I was starting fourth grade, I went to Riverdale Country School up in Riverdale in the Bronx, and I went there because my grandfather had been the classmate and friend of the headmaster who founded the school, a fellow named Frank Hackett.  Frank Hackett was the headmaster for three years when I was there, from fourth to sixth grade, then it was three more years before he died.  He was a presence.  Frank Hackett could out-sing the entire school.  We used to have daily chapel and I got a lot of religion, not specific religion, but a lot of “Be good, think of others,” you know.  All of the kind of moral things were beat into you again and again and again, to, I think, everyone’s benefit.  At the time I wasn’t aware how much good it did me, but I think it has done me a lot of good throughout my life.  Riverdale is a great school, and I was there for nine years.\n\nQ:  Do you remember what the food was like?\n\nZagat:  The food was very mundane, very mundane.  Chicken à la King was a highpoint in the—nobody thought the food was particularly good at Riverdale at that time.\nAnyway, I was trying to think of what other things my parents disagreed about.  I think everything.\n\nQ:  Did they disagree about food?\n\nZagat:  Yes, they did.  My father liked to go to restaurants, and in those days the food in New York, the best restaurants might have grilled chicken, steak, potatoes, no green vegetables in the wintertime, no fresh berries, of course, from October until May.  It was a very limited menu and there were not very many different types of cuisine.  In fact, in 1979, when we started our survey, there were about twenty different nationalities in New York, and today we count over a hundred.  So in a thirty-year period it’s gigantic.\n\nQ:  Makes a big difference.\n\nZagat:  I’d be happy to talk about that change, if you’d like.\n\nQ:  We can get to that.\n\nZagat:  Food was not the strong point at Riverdale.  There were a lot of other wonderful things about it, very good athletics, and it got me into Harvard, or, at least, I thought maybe it had something to do with it.  Seven out of thirty-five people in our class went to Harvard, and several of us roomed together and we have remained lifelong friends.  Our class reunions are kind of amazing in terms of the percentage of people who come back.  Anyway, I played a variety of sports at Riverdale.\nMy mother liked to cook, or at least she—\n\nQ:  I was going to say, a good thing or a bad thing?\n\nZagat:  It was not a very good thing, and I would only say this since she is no longer going to come back and hit me over the head, but she does have a presence.  I mean, every time I say something like this, I have a feeling she’s sitting behind me saying, “Oh, Tim.  Oh, Tim.”\nMy father and my grandfather liked to go out to eat in the best restaurants that exist in New York, and there was some pretty good—the Pavillon and the Café Chauveron and Café Arnold and Tony Soma’s.  Tony Soma’s was the—what’s the actress?  Anyway, I can’t remember.  She was Nicholson’s girlfriend and has been in all kinds of movies.  Anyway, she was a daughter of the Somas.\nMy father would have us go out as much as possible, and maybe that’s because he knew what my mother’s cooking was like.  She thought that pretty much everything should be frozen first, and that food wasn’t safe unless it had been frozen, and she didn’t think just anybody knew how to freeze.  She wanted somebody with a lot of experience, and therefore she thought A & P had more experience freezing more things, so that’s where she went for her frozen things.  She would make a Thanksgiving dinner and have ten pounds of turkey left and she’d freeze it, and then that would be the 1955 turkey, and the 1957 ham would go into the freezer too.  Then she would, in 1961, discover the six-year-old ham and turkey, she would pull them out, heat them up, put them in a casserole, pour in mushroom soup or onion soup or both, beat them around, and she would be very proud of her casserole.  She did this for parties and she did it too often for us alone.\nSo the main question I had when I met Nina and she started cooking food for us was, “How old is it?”  She never understood why I was so upset, but, I mean, it was, “How old is it?”\n\tWe used to very often, particularly when we were in Stamford, Connecticut, there was a good pizza place called Mario’s on High Ridge Road, and we would leave the table—this was when we were old enough to drive, which is sixteen—leave the table immediately, go down to Mario’s to get some food, to get some pizza.\n\tAnyway, I was at Harvard and had four wonderful years and played soccer and generally had a lot of fun, learned more from my classmates than I did any other way.  Then I got out of college and I was elected Vice President of the United States National Student Association, which is a long story, but I traveled for four years speaking at colleges all over the United States, and I went to 197 colleges to speak, and it was a very interesting year.  I was talking about student government activities and insurance and civil and student rights.\n\nQ:  What was the purpose of the organization?\n\nZagat:  It was an association of student governments at approximately 300 colleges and universities.  It had held 330 or 340, but with the Civil Rights Movement, the southern schools withdrew.  The purpose of the organization, dependent on who you asked, it was basically to cooperate among schools and student governments, but there were certain people like Tom Hayden and Students for a Democratic Society who were wanting it to be very political, and it just, by coincidence, happened that the CIA, which I didn’t even know was involved, was funding a large part of its activities because they wanted it to be political.  It call came out after my tenure, in a big article about it in Ramparts magazine.  But the CIA was supporting a lot of youth organizations, youth and labor, and they wanted to have stands taken that they could go to international student congresses and talk to the outs around the world, and make contact with them and maintain communication, and also on the possibility that somebody would get elected president of Algeria, which, in fact, happened, they wanted to have people who knew them from the United States’ government perspective.\nSo in my first year at NSA, was there as a freshman, I came out against our taking a position in favor of Algerian independence.  I said, “We are not elected student government leaders, so we’re not elected to take stands like this.”  Turns out, the CIA wanted us to take stands like that because it made it possible for them to have connections, and we were actually funding something like fifty to a hundred Algerian so-called students, but people had been injured in the fighting and they were in the United States under our auspices being treated.\n\tSo there were lots of other—for example, the same thing was true for Cuba.  They wanted to have some people who were their people, who actually knew what the hell was going on in Cuba.  Now, it’s a rational thing for the CIA.  It was strange—[former Washington Post reporter and editor] Bob Kaiser knows all about this because he was involved, but you didn’t expect the CIA to be coming over your left shoulder.  You would have expected them to come over your right shoulder, at least I thought they would be to the right of us.  They were actually way to the left, and they wanted to encourage political action.  I was opposed to that, and I ran for president of NSA and lost by twenty-five votes out of two thousand or so, and was saying we should allocate our efforts to strictly student rights on campus, civil rights in the United States, insurance, getting good insurance for college students, and doing a lot of things that the AARP, for example, does for elderly people.  We should have been working to make students’ lives better and get more scholarships and stuff like that.  My candidacy, which I lost, as I said, my campaign manager was [Massachusetts congressman] Barney Frank, and it was my last campaign and his first.\n\nQ:  Was he in the organization as well?\n\nZagat:  Yes, he was in the organization.  Anyway, he’s a great friend of mine for many, many years.\n\nQ:  He’s a wonderful guy, yes.\n\nZagat:  I think he’s great.  But then after that I went to the Peace Corps, and shortly after I got there, Bill Moyers called me and said, “We have some problems.  I’d like you to do a little study on them.” \n\nQ:  Were you scheduled to go overseas at that point?\n\nZagat:  I was supposed to be in Washington.  I was on staff.  Anyway, he said, “We’re ordering the same reading materials four or five times over,” and the people who handle the finances kept on seeing the same books being bought for different operations repetitively.  So I went around and talked to everybody and found out it was just lack of coordination.  So I wrote a short memo saying activities need to be coordinated, at least at this level, and he said, “Would you take charge of it?”\n\tI said, “Boy, yeah.”  So I became head of the Book Coordination Office of the Peace Corps.  We published thirty-four books out of three different countries, mostly taking American textbooks and turning them into the local idiom, instead of saying “Plug into the wall,” saying “Clip onto the battery” and things like that.  Instead of Joey White and Cecilia Brown playing in the snow, it became Joseph Inugu and, you know, just making it feel more appropriate to the particular countries.\nWe had Peace Corps CARE packages of books.  The major thing is we had what were called book lockers.  They were really trunks, metal trunks, and we would supply each volunteer with a full trunk of books, half of which related to the volunteer’s job and half relating to having something to do in the bush, where you didn’t have television by way of entertainment.  I had to pick all of those books and make sure that they got all over the world.  Over time we changed the way these things were packaged, and found some very strong cardboard that was amazingly much stronger than the trunks.  I picked thousands of books because we were working with different people in different places.  Shriver had said he was going to get a million books for Africa before I arrived.\n\nQ:  This is Sargent Shriver.\n\nZagat:  Yes.  He had stimulated every women’s club in America to go in the closets and in the attics and get books and ship them to us, and we had no place really where we could put them.  I had to arrange to get that all sorted out.  Ninety percent of the books were totally useless, and it was just a mass of stuff.  We had some people in Washington who sorted it all out, and we sent a million books to South Africa, I think it was, or Nigeria.  We sent some books that were useful, but we probably had gone through ten million books before we came up with the million.\n\tAnyway, there was a lot of stuff, and I was a young person and I was put on the senior staff of the Peace Corps, which was really exciting.  I would see Shriver every day and I’d see Bill Moyers.  Bill only told me recently, but he got me a huge jump in my civil service rating, because I wouldn’t have been allowed to do this job if I didn’t have a CS-15 or something, and I started with CS-5 or CS-6, and I don’t know what he did, but it sure was good for my economy.\n\tSo anyway, I got through that, and my mother was saying, “This is wonderful.  Stay down.”  And my father said, “If you want me to pay for law school, you go now.”  So I then was lucky enough to get into Yale law school and was lucky enough to be asked to sit next to a young lady named Nina Safronoff, who was a very good cook.\n\nQ:  Back up a little bit.  Was law school an inevitable choice for you?\n\nZagat:  No, but I had originally thought I wanted to be a politician, and it seemed to me that law school was the best place to go for that.  I never did become a politician because I began to realize all of the difficulties, that, first of all, somebody wants to kick your teeth in every two years, and not only your teeth, but your family’s.  Number two, you have to raise money from your friends in order to give it to television stations.  Number three, you have to do this work at night and on weekends, when everybody else wants to be with their family, including me.  Number four, I figured I had too thin skin.  I just didn’t like the nastiness of politics these days, at least for quite a long time.\n\tSo anyway, I went to Yale law school, where I was assigned to sit next to Nina Safronoff, and we started studying together with a group with a few friends.  The most distinguished of them was a guy named Walter Dellinger, who became Solicitor General of the United States, I think.  He’s still a friend of ours.  Nina and I started studying more and more, and all these women I used to date sort of disappeared.  After the first year of law school, I guess the beginning of the second year, it seemed to me we were always together.  Then I called her mother and asked her mother if she could arrange a wedding on short notice, four weeks, and her mother asked me the logical question, “Is there something urgent that we need to know about?”\n\tI said, “No, it has nothing to do with that.”  I think everything I do, I like to do quickly, and I’m not a person who’s very deliberate.  Once I get going, fixated on something, I’m very stay-with-it-and-go.\nAnyway, so her mother said, “How about six weeks?”\n\tI said, “That’s fine.”\nThen I called my parents to tell them that we were getting married, and that was when Nina walked in and found out that she was getting married.  You have to understand that you should never propose to somebody unless you know that they want to get married.  I knew she wanted to get married, so why bother proposing?\n\nQ:  So her mother knew before?\n\nZagat:  Her mother knew before she did, but she knew.  She knew.  I know she knew.  She knew that I wanted to get married, and I knew that she wanted to get married, and you didn’t need to say anything, so I didn’t.  Why waste time?\n\tSo anyway, we were married just after spring vacation in our second year of law school, and we went that summer for three months in Europe.  We bought a car in Wolfsburg, Germany, a brand-new Volkswagen Squareback, and we slept in the back, had air mattresses, and we drove all over Europe, and we did the same thing the next year, after the bar exam.\n\tBut as for food, Nina is a really good cook.  She wasn’t doing the Jill [Julie Powell] routine, you know, Jill and Julia.  She didn’t cook everything in Julia’s cookbook, but she did a fair share.  Nina liked Craig Claiborne, I think, and whatever she was doing, I thought it was a hell of a lot better than what I was used to growing up.\nAfter we were out of law school and through the bar exam, she joined Sherman & Sterling and I joined Hughes Hubbard & Reed.\n\nQ:  So you took the New York bar?\n\nZagat:  Yes.  Charles Evans Hughes, who had been Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and also ran for president of the United States against Wilson.  So we were there, and almost about a year later or maybe less than a year, I was asked if I’d like to go to Paris.  I thought that was a great idea, but then we had to negotiate Nina’s going.  Her firm was so conservative, they would never have let a woman go abroad, except for the fact that their conservativism played in our favor.  They would never separate a husband and a wife.  So she went and said, “My husband’s going to Europe and I don’t want to be left alone here.”\n\tThey said, “Oh, Nina, dear, you go to Paris too.”  So on the basis of their conservatism, she got to be the first woman to go to the Paris office of Sherman & Sterling.  I happened to be the first male to go to the new Paris office of Hughes Hubbard & Reed, which was a much smaller office; it had three lawyers in it at the time.\nWe had two kind of blissful years of, number one, trying to take advantage of being in Paris and reading Hemingway’s Moveable Feast.  We really tried every second weekend to go somewhere that was interesting, and caught a plane or got a train and traveled a lot.  We also ate a lot, and had an incredible budget for eating out because the senior partner in our office didn’t like to take people out as much as he would have normally have to, so he would assign less important people to us to take out, which was very nice.  So we were eating on the firm in a way that nobody in New York ever would have.\nNina went to the Cordon Bleu and ultimately became the lawyer for the Cordon Bleu, and learned a lot of new things about food.  She was doing a good job of French food and American food.\nFinally, somebody set us up with a Chinese housekeeper, who was unbelievable in every way.  She couldn’t speak a word of English or French, but to give you an idea, the first day she came in and we couldn’t talk, she was with the family, the Chinese family that she was with, and he said, “You’re not going to need to talk to her.”\n\tNina and I were saying, “We’ve got to talk to her.”\nBut the first day she cleaned everything, every window, every glass.  You name it.  The house was spotless in a way that it had never been when we were first there.  The next day, she went through all of my clothes, and everything was sewn, everything was put into the closet just neatly, anything that needs to be pressed was pressed.  And the third day she started producing Chinese food, and our icebox was always full of egg rolls and things that were delicious.  She was a fine cook.  So we had French food, we had American food, we had Chinese food, and we had a very good diet.\n\tWhen we came back to New York around 1970, shortly after that, we joined a food and wine group.  We had about twenty friends that would eat and drink once a month, and we had some very good meals, but we were essentially just a bunch of friends.\n\nQ:  What were food and wine groups like then?\n\nZagat:  You know, I don’t know.  I was only a member of that one, and we had a wonderful group of friends.\n\nQ:  You’d go out or someone would cook?\n\nZagat:  One time we’d go out and we’d plan and we’d bring all of our wines, and we’d have, for example, Aubrillon, ten vintages, you’d have Lafite, Latour, Aubrillon of one year, so that you could do interesting tastings.  Also the people would cook at home, and Nina would do a dinner and it would be really a blowout meal.  Each of us sort of shared the costs and passed it around, the work.\n\tWe called this thing the Downtown Wine Tasting Association, which was really dignifying a group of friends who ate and drank a lot.  We were at one of our dinners and the person who was most active at the time was Ivan Karp, who is the owner of OK Harris Gallery, and he was the number two guy to Leo Castelli, so he was a big deal art dealer.  Ivan is outspoken when he is sober, and he was not particularly sober that day.  He was probably on his tenth or twelfth glass of wine, and he sailed into the then critic of a particular newspaper that is too powerful to mention even now.  Anyway, he really said basically that half the time he didn’t agree at all.\nI’d done political surveying before, and Nina actually had worked too.  I said, “Why don’t we do a survey of our friends who we think would enjoy it, people who eat out a lot, and who like to talk about food?”  We all had pads of paper in front of us, yellow pads, legal, and I said, “Everybody write down ten names of people you think would enjoy being surveyed on the top restaurants in New York,” and they did.  After a couple months, we did a survey of two hundred people on a hundred restaurants.  And that’s what it looked like, that’s the questionnaire and that’s the results.  Everybody liked the results so much, they all asked for ten more copies.  The deal was if you participate, you get one copy for free.  So even though nobody had ever heard of user-generated content, that is user-generated content.\n\nQ:  I see those columns.  They must represent—\n\nZagat:  Ratings.\n\nQ:  Was it divided into, I don’t know like—\n\nZagat:  Food, décor, service, cost, and cleanliness.  We eliminated cleanliness after a while.  The results were two sides of a fourteen-inch page of paper, and everybody seemed to like it and we got more and more requests for it.  People would say, “Would you send over enough copies for my law firm?”  The second year was five hundred people, and the third year was a thousand, and we raised the number of restaurants.  In the second year it was two hundred, and the third year it was three hundred and fifty.\n\nQ:  Who put all that together?\n\nZagat:  Me and Nina, and I had secretaries who would help me, being paid to stay late.  But the third year got to be so complicated and expensive that we decided to sell copies and try to make our hobby tax-deductible, and that was Nina’s input because she’s a tax lawyer, and she hates using after-tax money for anything.  So she said, “At least let’s make our hobby less expensive by being deductible, and also if people like it so much, let’s ask them to pay for what they say they like.”  And that was the first year we did it as a book, and we broke even that year, which was never in our wildest imagination.  That article up there was the first review by a newspaper of what we did, and we were very pleased that the newspapers didn’t kill us, that they kind of accepted the idea that we were doing this.\n\nQ:  Like a book review?\n\nZagat:  Yes, it was sort of a book review.  This writer was Arthur Schwartz, who was very well known, the critic for the Daily News.  He was saying that for a lot of reasons our survey avoided some of the pitfalls of the individual critic, bad days either on the part of the critic or on the part of the restaurant, taste preferences that didn’t necessarily represent everybody, limited number of visits that were possible for the critic because the critic hits the restaurant in the middle of the summer and it may be very different from in the middle of the winter.\nGradually we learned that there were some analytic reasons why what had been our original thought was just inchoate, that if you had a large number of people and you had the right people, you were going to get better results than one person, and that the results should be easy to use.  Therefore, we designed the book, which everybody said it’s going to be terrible, it’s going to get lost in the shelves.  We said, “It’s not going to be in the shelves; we’re going to put it at the cash register.”  People said, “Ha, ha, ha, you can’t get in the cash register.”  Well, we did.\n\nQ:  How did you synthesize what you wanted to be in those reviews?  How much space did you—\n\nZagat:  They’re very much about the length of our current reviews.  We wanted to touch all the bases, food, décor, service and cost, and who goes there, and basically give as succinct a view of the restaurant as possible, but to do it synopsizing what a large number of other people were saying, not our own point of view, but what hundreds of people were saying.  The whole idea was that you’re better off if you have hundreds.  So the reviews were meant to be short.  These things were meant to go into somebody’s pocket of a jacket or a pocketbook.  We really kind of designed it to meet our own needs, and we also asked all of our surveyors to please tell us what they would like us to do and how they would like us to do it, constantly asking people to share their point of view with us, and we really pay attention to it.\n\tI think the two kind of major things that we really did that were different are, one, most media has always been a one-way street, and the people doing it are—this is not a criticism, but I mean their satisfaction in some ways, they get smart, they learn about a subject and they tell you, and if they’re good enough, you pay for their knowledge.  But it has never been a two-way street until very recently.\n\nQ:  What was out there at that point?  Obviously, there were the restaurant reviews in the newspapers and I guess New York Magazine.\n\nZagat:  There was New York Magazine and I think Gael Greene was doing it then, and for a long time the New York Times had Craig Claiborne, who I’m proud to say I have a letter from him on the wall, saying that we love what we did.  New York Magazine did a huge feature.  That’s the cover, the folded cover, which was called “Food Spooks.”  So the people you might have thought were competitive treated us with, I think, kindness and support at the time.\n\tAnyway, we went to every publisher that we could find.  Oh, I remember what I was saying.  One is the two-way street.  We started out by listening to other people, rather than telling them.  We packaged what they had and then sold it back to them.  The other thing that was unique about what we did, we used surveying techniques.  We’ve always had surveying serving sellers, you know, “You should change the color of your package,” and all kinds of surveys that have been done for a long time for the benefit of sellers, to identify the interests of the buyer and how the buyer was reacting to their products.  We turned it around and we did it for the benefit of the buyer.  Now it happens, incidentally, that all of our surveys are giving the sellers free-market studies of their customers’ attitudes, and if a restaurant gets twenty-four for food and sixteen for service, that’s the same people saying the service is not as good.  The restaurants that understand that use it, and many do to this day.  In fact, people pay their staffs partly if they do better on our ratings in particular ways.  So those are two fundamentally different things.\n\tWe happened to be doing this at a time which was sort of catching the wave of increasing public interest in food, and some fundamental demographic changes, which I either will write a book about one day or will pay somebody else to write a book about, but just a lot of basic changes that account for the revolution in food that we have.  Some of the simplest ones are jet travel, which came in in the sixties, but it was several decades before most middle-class people had ever traveled anywhere.  But as people traveled more, they got more exposed to better food, and a lot of people now knew what French food really tastes like by having gone to France, and Italian food in Italy.  So we educated our audience by that change.\n\tThe second major change with jet travel was we were able to bring in—and packaging that would accompany it—ingredients that could never before have been served.  So you had fresh grapes and fresh berries and fresh green vegetables in the middle of the winter in northern cities, and that really was important.  When we exhausted the supply of sea bass off the Grand Banks, we got it flown in live from Chile.  So the shipment and moving people around were very important.\n\tThe change in the employment structure, in 1979 essentially most families, 60 percent of families with children, there was only one person working; that was the man.  Today it’s 75 percent, both husband and wife are working.  So there’s nobody around to shop, cook, and clean from Monday to Friday in large swathes of America.  The greatest growth in jobs in this county has been in service industry jobs, where those are places where you work long hours, not unionized, and the one thing your employer does for you is says, “Look, if you go out on a business lunch, you charge it to us, and if you work after 8:30,” which is what we do here, “anybody who works after 8:30 gets a free meal.”  So there’s a support of eating out by your business.  Lawyers, accountants, ad agency people, it’s not only their employer paying; the employer just passes on the bill to the client.  So as a lawyer, you know, my firm just put it on the bill.  Somebody else paid it.\n\tSo there was very strong support for more eating out as opposed to eating at home, and the restaurant industry became more and more efficient during this period.  The Immigration Act of 1965 brought in Asian food, which was less expensive, Asian restaurants.  The best we can tell during these thirty years, restaurant prices, inflation, has been about 2 percent, not at the high end, but 2 percent overall.  The overall inflation for the country, which you can check, in the last thirty years is something more like 5 percent.  So the restaurant industry has become more and more efficient relative to everything else, and there are a huge number of restaurants.  Did you grow up in New York?\n\nQ:  No, but I lived here in the sixties, so I can compare it to then.  I was in Washington for a long time, but I certainly know what it was like then.\n\nZagat:  You had maybe one restaurant on a block on Third Avenue.  Now you probably have six restaurants on a block.  The restaurants are mostly what we call BATH restaurants, Better Alternative to Home.  They are competing with what you can do yourself, and they are very good at it.  You’re better off spending an extra hour doing what you do well, which is writing or being a lawyer and getting paid for that, and making your mark in your profession, and let some little restaurant in the neighborhood do what it does well, and they buy wholesale, you buy retail.  When you throw in the value of your time, you’re probably better off eating out, and that has been driving more and more people into a new way of living.  Even the apartments on most of New York, the new buildings, have increasingly had small kitchens, and they really were not built, particularly in the sixties, seventies, and eighties, were not built for, unless you were a very fancy building, for serious cooking.  They were built for warming things up and doing things simply.\n\tAnyway, another factor that had played a major role was television and turning chefs into celebrities.  Julia Child probably started it, but we’ve now a full-time, twenty-four-hour network on cooking, and almost every local station has cooks’ shows, and it became a celebrity thing, and more and more people wanted to go to cooking school.  When I got out of college, I would say there were maybe ten cooking schools in the country.  There are over a hundred now.  Every state teachers college wants to put in a multi-million-dollar cooking program.  Then middle-class people more and more wanted to go into them, and there are thousands of young Americans who are well educated, going into this field.  When I was a kid, it was who the hell would go into cooking?  It was a hot, dirty job.  It’s for foreigners.  Now people are proud to say my son or my daughter is working for Daniel Boulud or for Eric Ripert.\nSo a whole mindset changed during this time, even something as simple as the School Lunch Act, which was initiated in the 1950s but it was actually implemented gradually over a fairly long time.  When I got out of school, and even Riverdale, they had a cafeteria but it was only put in in the sixth grade, between the time I started school and the sixth grade, I took a lunchbox.  Basically, most American kids were getting food prepared at home by their mother until, at the earliest, late 1950s, and most of the schools only put in cafeterias in the sixties and seventies.  But once they did, we were educating all of our children to eat out.  We were habituating them into the idea that you eat out every day.  So there’s just all of these factors.\nI think back in terms of food, when I was a kid, Italian food usually came out of a can and was macaroni and spaghetti and had red sauce on it.  Chinese food was chow mein and chop suey, also out of a can.  Raw fish was a fraternity prank.  I mean, really, who would eat raw fish?  I mean, the only people who ate raw fish were kids who were having to get into a fraternity.  Then lettuce, iceberg; mushrooms, Parisian button cap.  My mother specifically told me that I should never eat anything that anybody said was a mushroom other than that, because it was probably poisonous and might kill me.  So I knew enough to stay away from anything else, and I think every other kid in America, practically, unless they really lived on a farm and had somebody who knew what they were eating, we didn’t have those things.\nEvery time I go into a restaurant, which is all the time, I’m sitting there and they say things to me, telling me about the menu, and I realize that 90 percent of what they’re saying I wouldn’t have had a clue what they were talking about when I was twenty years old.\n\nQ:  Give me an example.\n\nZagat:  Oh, I mean pretty much any menu that I go to, they’re always talking about—I mean, I don’t have one in front of me, but I was just sitting at lunch today and it had sea urchin.  I didn’t know sea urchins were a food.  There was various kinds of sauces in it, that I have never, never heard of in those days, that are basically delicious.  I just every day hear people say things that were largely unknown fifty years ago, and it’s part of the excitement and growth of the culinary—we’ve been watching and happen to be lucky enough to be part of this amazing revolution, and the role, if we have a role that I can say we’re proud of is, that we gave people a voice, and we empowered the customer.  We have about 350,000 or 400,000 people now who do participate every year, and we do give them the chance to articulate, and at the same time we try to look at what they do and synopsize it so it’s useful to other people.\n\nQ:  Let’s just go back for a second to the timing of this.  You started those informal guides in ’83?\n\nZagat:  No, this was ’79.  It’s called 1980, but it’s like the car year.  The 1980 model comes out in the fall of ’79.\n\nQ:  You had the four guides in 1987.  So what happened in between those two years?\n\nZagat:  First we had three years of doing our hobby in New York.  Then we had three more years of doing a New York guide as a little book, and we went from 7,500 copies in ’83, 17,000 copies in ’84, I think it was, then 40,000 copies in ’85—these were sold—and then we had this cover story of New York Magazine that came out in December or November of ’85, and took us from 40,000 copies a year to 75,000 copies a month, in one month, which created havoc for us.\n\nQ:  You mean the magazine article did?\n\nZagat:  Yes.  It was a big article, and suddenly everybody in New York said, “Hey, my friends are doing this.  This is cool.”\n\nQ:  With what kind of staff?\n\nZagat:  Probably three, two or three of us, mostly me editing, and we had people printing it for us.  Anyway, the first year we wanted to get somebody to publish this for us, and we were turned down by everybody in the fall of ’82, I guess.  Instead of feeling bad about it, you know, we wanted to get a publisher, but it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to us.\n\nQ:  You mean in the sense that you decided to publish it yourself?\n\nZagat:  Yes, well, first of all, we were willing to because it was our hobby.  The fact that other people didn’t appreciate what we were doing, we were sorry about it, but we liked doing what we were doing and we liked doing it the way we were doing it.  So we just kept on doing it.  I got turned down by two publishing houses that reported to me.  I was at Gulf & Western, and Simon & Schuster and Prentice Hall both turned me down, and that just tells you something, I guess.  My uncle owned Athenaeum.  They published the New York Times Guide, and he told me the reason he was turning us down was that they didn’t like local books, and, number one, none of the national publishers liked that, and, number two, he said the New York Times only sold 35,000, and we were already doing comparable at that point.  But he said, “It’s just not a big enough deal.”\nSo a few years later, after we were selling 75,000 a month, everybody came back, all the publishers came and said, “Can we help you?”  And we said, “No thanks.”  We were lucky, because they would have taken 80 percent or 90 percent of the revenue, and we would have gotten 10 to 20 percent, if we were lucky, and it wouldn’t have supported really going at it and creating a new publishing house.\nIn 1987 we came out with four books more, and the reason for that, among other things, was Nina, again, had a tax issue.  In 1986 we were making too much money.  That one month we were making half a million dollars a month, and Nina said, “We can’t do this.  We’ve got to spend money.”  So we decided to go into other places and reduce our taxable income.  We didn’t know what would happen, because we didn’t know whether people in Chicago would have a completely different take on food than people in New York, and that they would be overcome by putting a “le” in front of a name or a “la.”  It turned out that pretty much the same people were participating in all four other cities, and in the first year we were probably the number one selling guide in all four other cities.\n\nQ:  That’s amazing.\n\nZagat:  Yes, it was, and none of this was particularly planned.  We did create a better mousetrap and we hit, I guess, a nerve, an interest of people’s.\n\nQ:  How did you distribute the questionnaires that were in other cities?\n\nZagat:  We targeted the same kinds of people.  We sent it to law firms, accounting firms.  We tried to get somebody at each firm to circulate it.  We had friends who were lawyers pretty much everywhere, so we were able to get them to distribute.  I was at Gulf & Western, and I was in charge of a huge lot of litigation.  So there were lots of lawyers who were anxious to—I talked to them all the time, I’d tell them what we were doing.  “Send me a bunch.”\n\tSo anyway, we were able to target people in each of those cities who were very much like the people that we were dealing with in New York, and we grew the amount of cash flow for the next fourteen or fifteen years.  I left full-time law practice in 1987, and Nina was in the middle of some major stuff and left in 1990.  We just figured it was better to have one person who had a full-time job in case this thing turned out to be a chimera.  Is it chimera [shimera] or kimera [with accents on first syllables]?\n\nQ:  I think it’s chimera [accent on second syllable], but I’m not positive.\n\nZagat:  Chimera.  I didn’t get it right.  It’s like people pronounce my name.\nSo we kept on growing out of cash flow.  We did other things.  I’m a believer in the methodology, and Nina’s more food, and she’s more interested in international food.\n\nQ:  What do you mean, you’re more of a believer in the methodology?\n\nZagat:  I love the idea of a democratic survey-based gathering of information, and it’s not that Nina doesn’t appreciate that, but I mean, if it was up to her, she would do probably all restaurants and more cities internationally.  We do cover ninety cities now for restaurants.  We cover a hundred and four countries for hotels, cover nightlife, which our sons got us to do, shopping, which we figured it was useful to have coverage.  We do movies, music, theater, a variety of other things.  I’m a believer in the methodology and she’s more interested in the substance.\n\nQ:  How did these decisions for these new directions come about?\n\nZagat:  Usually we talk about them, and I’d say, “Let’s do hotels.”  We talk about every aspect, everything that’s important about what we do.  We talk to each other.  Gradually we had other people in the office who were actually knowledgeable about different things.  So we’d have a person who is head of trade sales, who’d advise us about what we should be doing for the bookstores and almost everything.  Originally I was very involved, and Nina was, because it was too small not to be.  So, for example, we both felt that having Lucite containers was a better way to represent the books in public and seeing them, so we decided that we’d make Lucites available to every store for free, and it worked.  It really holds the books up, and so we don’t have to worry about them being in the shelves and being invisible.\nObviously, behind me, we did deluxe books, which were gold- and silver-stamped, and the way that started was Peter Gogolak, who is a very famous football player and has scored more points for the New York Giants football franchise than any other player in its history, he and his brother Charlie came from Hungary with their family, escaped in 1956.  They both played professional football, and they revolutionized kicking in professional football because they kicked soccer style from the instep, and they kicked further and more accurately than any American.  Because the boys, when I was growing up, you kicked with the point of your toe and sometimes it went like that, and sometimes it went like that, and sometimes it went where you wanted it to.  Anyway, they proved that the European style of kicking was much more accurate and much more powerful.\n\tPeter, after he got through playing football, became chief financial salesman for Charles P. Young and then later R.R. Donnelley.  When he was at Charles P. Young, he came to me.  He’d seen our first book, and we were halfway through the first year, and he said could I make a deluxe edition and stamp their name on it.  I didn’t really know what a deluxe edition was.  So I asked him, “What is it you really want?”\n\tHe said, “I want matte finish and heavier cover, and I want a gilding around the edges, and I want to stamp our company name on it.”  There’s a whole window full of them.\n\nQ:  Yes, I was noticing that.\n\nZagat:  I said, “How many copies would you like?”\n\tHe said, “Well, let’s start with 5,000,” and I almost fell off my chair.  Five thousand copies and we were sort of in the middle of the year and maybe had sold 3,500 up to that of all, and here’s somebody telling me before our next year he wants 5,000.\n\nQ:  When was this?\n\nZagat:  That was in 1983, going into the ’84 year.  I thought that was fantastic.  In fact, I thought it was so exciting, I didn’t remember to talk to him about how much it would cost.  We had delivered it to him before—he called me and he said, “How much is this?”  And, jeez, 5,000 books and I haven’t talked to him, and I said how much I thought was reasonable, and he said that he thought that was more than reasonable, and the next week I got a check for that.\nBut what I didn’t realize that was more important than the sale of 5,000. Financial printers go around to every major company and they go to the vice president for marketing or they go to the chief financial officer or the president, and they try to get big printing.  Now, I started getting calls.  I mean, they were giving these out everywhere, all over the country, and I started getting calls from people like Citibank saying, “We got this thing from Charles P. Young.  Could you do 10,000 copies for us?”  It dawned on me that we had a forty-man sales force dealing with the most incredible companies in America, and they were paying us for the opportunity of doing this.  They’re still doing it all these years later, and it’s interesting—remind me [an aside to PR person who is observing the interview], I have to call R.R. Donnelley tomorrow.\n\tSo we kept on going, and then in 1999 we set up our own website.  Before that, we had been very early in licensing electronic content, and our business was always basically electronic, and so we started licensing people like AOL, CompuServe, Prodigy, in the 1980s.\n\nQ:  So how did that work?  They would put your content on their—\n\nZagat:  Yes, on their sites, and they’d pay us for that.  Then the Baby Bells came in and they did it, and Time Warner did it, and something called Pathfinder.  We then did our own site in 1999, which I thought was unbelievably expensive, but Nina sort of took the lead on that, and she still does.  I call her my web mistress, because I really do not have the knowledge that she does about the internet.\nOur site was quite popular, people liked it, and all sorts of people in the venture capital world started coming around and saying, how about spinning off the dot.com part of our business, and they wanted to run it up a tree and then sell it for as many million dollars as they could.\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, the staff grew, right?  I mean, the staff grew from nothing to—\n\nZagat:  The staff at that point was probably thirty or forty by 1999.\n\nQ:  In the beginning, what kind of people did you hire?  Did you hire editors?\n\nZagat:  We had editors gradually.  I’m not even sure exactly, without looking back and looking at employment records.  We gradually had more editors; we had more people in trade sales; we had more people in corporate sales.  Corporate sales were the kind of deluxe books, and they were very high-margin books, so we had more and more people doing that.  But it was all kind of gradual and by seeing which way the wind was blowing.  Both of us had at least the experience of being lawyers, so we were not neophytes and we knew how to read a balance sheet.\n\nQ:  I’m trying to get a sense of what your lives were like.  For how long were you the ones that were more or less synthesizing the content?\n\nZagat:  Probably until sometime like 1990.  I probably was still doing it even in the early 1990s.  I was the principal editor, and PR was principally me, but Nina also was more and more, and she’s gotten better in many ways than I am.  Tiffany will tell you, she’s much more succinct and she’s both very bright, but also she really answers questions simply and clearly.\n\nQ:  Was it hard for you to give up having the last word on what these little snippets of information were?\n\nZagat:  No.  I still was looking at them probably into the late 1990s.  I still had the editorial right to change something if I didn’t like it, but we had really good people.  We have an editorial department that is first-class, and the people have gotten so good that I am now, for the most part, I may read the front of a book.  I was looking at the front of a book for Seoul, Korea, when you came in.  But for the most part, I don’t read the text except if I’m interested particularly in, let’s say, the top fifty restaurants in New York.  I like to see what we said about them, but I know that I’m not going to have to make any changes.\nThe key, by the way, in terms of editing, is, one, if you have hundreds of people saying what they think, there are themes that come out, and these reviews almost write themselves.  The other thing is the numerical ratings are like the lines on the ball field on which you play.  If something is a twenty-five, you cannot say it’s anything other than excellent food.  You could say it’s expensive food or you could say it’s unusual because Chef Gray was working in Thailand for the last five years, was using Thai spices on French food, but you’ve got to say it’s great.  Six for décor, it could be an amusing dump, but it’s a dump.  It’s not a beautiful, fancy—you cannot use the word “beautiful” for a six.\nSo we have a lot of things which basically help these things write them in a disciplined and, hopefully, fair way.  The worst thing that could ever happen to us is if we started producing results that were untrue or unfair.  We go to great lengths to try to make sure, and I don’t think we’ve ever been faulted for the accuracy and fairness of what we’re saying.  If you have a thousand people or five hundred people who’ve been in a restaurant and they’re telling you what they’re experiencing, there aren’t too many ways you can make a mistake.  Also we have gone to great lengths to make sure that nobody can cheat.  We’ve spent millions of dollars doing that.\n\nQ:  You mean say things about restaurants they haven’t been to?\n\nZagat:  Yes.  But more the restaurant, we drive more traffic in probably than anybody else, at least have for a long time, and we want to make sure that the restaurant doesn’t decide to get into the game and vote for itself.\n\nQ:  Oh, of course.  What about eating and cooking?  Have those habits in your life changed, the two of you?\n\nZagat:  When we’re in New York, we probably eat out six nights out of seven, and we eat out lunch probably five days a week.  But in the country, we cook.  I grill and Nina cooks.  She still is a good cook.\n\nQ:  The shape of the book, was it a model done the Michelin shape?\n\nZagat:  It’s not the Michelin shape.\n\nQ:  It’s not?\n\nZagat:  No.  Michelin is wider and shorter, and we designed the shape so that it would go into pockets, and Michelin doesn’t.  The other thing is when the venture capitalists came along and they gave us about 32 million dollars, we then had agreed with them, the ones that we ultimately took, because we had lots of choices, we took General Atlantic Partners, Allen & Company, and Kleiner Perkins, which are probably three of the best venture capital people in the country, and we had three individuals.  Nathan Myhrvold, who is the founding technology officer of Microsoft and is a great friend, and he runs a company called Intellectual Ventures, which is a fantastically interesting company, and he’s working on what I think is going to be the seminal cookbook of our era right now, out in Seattle, talking about the equipment and new techniques of cooking.\n\nQ:  I don’t understand what you’re describing, actually.\n\nZagat:  Nathan Myhrvold’s cookbook.\n\nQ:  I mean, but how different?\n\nZagat:  Well, you know about people like Ferran Adrià, right?  Ferran Adrià is really a chemist.  Nathan is doing a lot of looking at what he and Fergus Henderson and a lot of other innovative chefs are doing around the world, but he’s also using equipment that has never been seen.\n\nQ:  Got it.\n\nZagat:  Centrifuges, for example, being used in cooking.  The ability to make ice cream and freeze it in about five seconds for the pint of ice cream.  It starts liquid, pfffft, using blowtorches.  There are lots and lots of techniques that are not widely used yet, and he’s showing what these techniques are and what their advantages are.\nThey had in New York the sous vide—we had a wonderful health commissioner, Tom Frieden, who in most ways was terrific.  He’s now head of the Centers for Disease Control out of Atlanta.  But Tom didn’t really understand sous vide cooking.  Sous vide has never caused anybody to get sick, and it’s safer than normal cooking.  So he required all the restaurants in New York to do very complicated things, which caused 90 percent of them to get out of the sous vide cooking business.\nNathan is writing about what temperatures and how to use sous vide in a lot of stuff that has never been put down on paper before, and this book, which is not a book, it’s going to be three books, and it’s going to probably sell for $1,000, and it’s going to be like no—I mean, he’s putting money into it that nobody normal could do.  He’s a billionaire.  Anyway, so Nathan is one of our investors and is a wonderful person, who’s interested, as we are, in food.\nNick Negreponte, who is a dean of the media lab at MIT, and Nancy Peretsman, who is probably the leading woman investment banker in the media, they are the investors.  They wanted us to do several things: one, to create a management team that could survive us if anything happened to us, which we’ve done; number two—and we wanted the same things, obviously—to create a data management system that’s digital, so that we could slice and dice content in any way you could imagine or could dream up; and thirdly, to conduct surveys anywhere in the world in real time in any language.  So we have people voting in Japan right now in Japanese.  I can’t read what they say, but our system allows that.  We have them voting in France in French, anything we would like in that regard.\nWe had to make sure that the system was secure and that we were able to target the people that we wanted and eliminate the people that we didn’t want.  We spent years doing it and were very careful.  It wasn’t really until about 2005, maybe 2006, we fully switched to online surveying, and everything has become digital.\n\nQ:  You mean so that the voters can do that online?\n\nZagat:  Yes.  Up to probably 2003 or 2002 we were entirely on paper, and online we were doing it on an experimental basis, and finally we made the complete switch.\n\nQ:  What has all this meant to your own lives?\n\nZagat:  It’s completely changed them.  I think one of the things that changed our lives goes back to our time in Paris, where we saw and then got to understand the different kind of culture and society which has six weeks off.  Most Americans think, “Oh, my god, six weeks.  How can they get anything done?  How can they do that?”\nThe first summer I was in Paris, I had a deal going through that I thought was going to be closed in the middle of August, and I didn’t know that the French law firm I was working with was going to close for the whole month of August.  I told the clients in New York that the thing would be over by probably mid August.\nI called on the first of August, and nobody was there.  “Oh, my god.  How can you do that?”\nAfter a while, I got to understand that there’s a real value in stopping and appreciating your family, and their interest in food, which played, certainly then, a larger part in their lives than ours, there were other ways to look at life and that slowing down a little bit is a healthy thing.\n\tI think that in some ways we followed our vision of shared experience and doing something that was new and democratic, and also was, I think, more accurate than anybody else ever had done.  To this day, I think we’re more accurate.  But it’s fun when your hobby turns into your business.  It isn’t as if we stopped working.  I mean, we have to work very hard, in some ways harder than ever, although lawyers worked hard.  Now when I go out at night and I go touring restaurants, that’s part of my work, but it doesn’t feel like work to me.\n\nQ:  Actually, how do you do that?  Do you go to one restaurant per night?\n\nZagat:  No, I go to twenty or twenty-five.\n\nQ:  Are you serious?\n\nZagat:  I’m serious.\n\nQ:  How do you do that?\n\nZagat:  Get in the car, get a driver, and go up and down.  I may take all the restaurants in one part of town, or I may go to all the new restaurants, or I may go to all the oldest restaurants.  I may go out to—\n\nQ:  So you mean you kind of just check in?\n\nZagat:  I’m checking restaurants and seeing how busy they are.  You can basically know everything there is to know about a restaurant, except how the food tastes, in five minutes.  You can look at the menu.  You can see whether it’s pretentious or straightforward, and how much things are.  You can smell.  Some places smell good and some don’t.  Stale food is a very bad sign for a restaurant.  You can see whether people are—how they’re dressed and whether they’re animated and whether the place is full, and whether people are doing like that.  And you can look at the way the food is presented.  You can just look at it, and I go into the kitchen a lot just to see.  But really, I said in an article, I think in the New York Times maybe twenty years ago, that I thought like 80, 85 percent accurate reviews in five minutes, and it was a little over the top to say that, I guess, but sometimes I’m over the top.\n\nQ:  How does it work?  Where do you eat?\n\nZagat:  Oh, at the end of the evening we usually stop at the place we thought looked best, and we come back and we eat.  Most nights I just go to one restaurant, like you do, and I know where I want to go, and I go and I eat, and that’s it.  But I go out a lot just as a kind of overview, and I’ve done that for years and years.\n\nQ:  With a driver?\n\nZagat:  Yes.  I do it for charity sometimes.  I mean, quite a few times, I take somebody.  The last time I did it, somebody paid $20,000 to just come along with me and have part of the experience.\n\nQ:  And not eat a morsel.  [laughs]\n\nZagat:  No, at the end we eat.  By the time you’ve been through twenty restaurants, you are very, very hungry.  So we then sit down and we have a good meal.\nOne of the things which we did, Contact Management System made it possible to customize guides any way you can think of, and we can do it electronically as well.  So we do micro sites for clients, and for office buildings we will put the office building or apartment house in the middle, and then we will have, let’s say, five blocks in all directions.  So we show what the building looks like, and we populate the neighborhood with all the shops and the restaurants and nightlife and tourist attractions.\n\nQ:  Who do you do that for?  For real estate companies or—\n\nZagat:  We do it for real estate companies; we do it for banks; we do it for universities.  The largest single sale we ever made was for Bank of America, and we did five million copies of a movie guide in one shot, which, except for Harry Potter, was the largest book sale of that year, and we didn’t have all the complexities of selling it to a lot of bookstores and getting returns.  We had a one-shot, everybody goes to them, and that’s it. \n\tWe did have one funny or not-so-funny thing happen.  Thank God, they didn’t tell me.  Our production head, who’s wonderful, found out that one of the three printing plants that this book was in—it took three plants to do it—they had taken the books and put them on a hot, humid cement floor.  One of the keys to this book was that it was being done on very light paper and light cover, so that you could put it in the mail with the minimal postage, and it had accumulated enough humidity so it went over the postage.  We would have had another thirty-two cents on two million books; it was a $600,000 mistake.  So she went down, and thank God she didn’t tell me about it because I’d have had a heart attack.  The printing plants have these gigantic knives, and she cut off a little bit around the edges.  They didn’t know and I didn’t know for months later that she had done that.\n\nQ:  You obviously have a very big part of your staff that is skilled with the new world, whether it’s digital or doing things like that. \n\nZagat:  Yes.\n\nQ:  At what point did that become a necessary part of your business?\n\nZagat:  Well, it started in probably 1999, maybe earlier, because we were licensing—Nina is closer to it, so she’d be better able to—\n\nQ:  I’ll ask her, yes.\n\nZagat:  You’re doing an interview with her too?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nZagat:  Good.  See if she says the same things as I do.  Maybe she’ll say totally different—she’s very much more self-controlled.  Isn’t she?  Yes.\nSo anyway, we like what we do.  It’s a fun thing.  It’s not the idea that you just go out and eat and have a good time.  There are a lot of aspects of this that are work.  When you have 100-and-something people full-time and 180 part-time, you’re worrying about people saying, “I want to go on vacation now,” and somebody has problems with their family, and somebody else is this and that, and you have all the kind of things that you have to manage in any business with people.  But I think the people that work with us tend to like it, and the one thing that we really look for is people who are nice.  I think the culture here is, if you’re not nice, you’re not going to be here.  There are certain values.  Like, if you don’t have something to do, see if you can help somebody else, things like—this goes back to my Riverdale days—but the other fellow first, try to think about how other people feel.  I think most of the people here very much meet those standards, and, as I say, if they really don’t, they’re not going to be here.\n\nQ:  It has that congenial reputation.  What about layoffs?  I mean, everybody is doing it all over the place.  Has your income changed?\n\nZagat:  The last quarter of the year represents probably 40 percent of our business usually, and last year, the beginning of October was like driving off a cliff.  All the big banks who were regular customers of ours and had been for years, were nowhere, so I would say we lost 15 percent of our business, which was probably at that period of time probably 30 percent of the last quarter.  Everybody else was going through the same thing.  We let go probably twenty or so people.\nThe thing is, we never let anybody go in the history of the business, and in some ways that maybe speaks to the kind of people we are and the way we feel about people who work with us.  But it also, last year, forced us to look at who is really contributing most and who’s not.  I think for a lot of businesses—I’ve talked to other people about it—to some degree it was a useful exercise.  On the other hand, it would have been nice if it hadn’t been such complete crisis.\nI have a friend who runs one of the biggest stock exchange companies, and he said just literally last year—it was one of the brand-name big companies—he said he’d had no idea how to run his business because the prices of the things that he was doing were changing so dramatically on a daily basis, he couldn’t make any plans.  Until things were stabilized, which I think was very important and very healthy for the country, people really didn’t know where things were going.  So you had to act as if things were not going to be great.  This year has turned out to be fine.\n\nQ:  That’s wonderful.  Is there anything I haven’t asked you that you would like to talk about?  Actually I had planned to ask you about some of the changes that you’ve seen over the years, but you talked about that, and if there’s any more about that, that, of course is always welcome.\n\nZagat:  I would say that it might be worthwhile for you to look either here or look in the—we have a storage room that has a lot of samples, and how they’re done.  I think they’re very unusual, and they’re used as marketing tools for all kinds of companies.  We do private-label surveying, which is something most people don’t know we do.  We’re surveying, I think, about fifty million people for Wellpoint.\n\nQ:  What is that?\n\nZagat:  Wellpoint is the old Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance.  What we’re doing is asking people not what they think of their doctors, because, you know, I don’t know if my doctor is a good cardiologist or not, but I do know whether my doctor is accessible, and when I call, does the doctor return my call.  I do know whether the doctor has a nice office.\n\nQ:  Wow.  That’s revolutionary.\n\nZagat:  Yes, well, nobody’s ever done it before, and we’re doing it for fifty million people.  It’s all being done through the Wellpoint system, and we’re just going to be starting—have they started in New York yet?\n\n[Unidentified speaker]:  We did.  Last month we launched.\n\nZagat:  It’s launched in New York?  Okay.  But we’re asking questions, do you think your doctor has good communication skills?  Is he clear?  Is he empathetic?  You know, whatever.  Does he make you feel good?  Those are things that the patient can answer.  We are surveying extensively, and we’re making that information available to the doctors in the Wellpoint system.  Wellpoint would go to the wall to defend the credibility to the doctor’s competence.  They choose the doctors because they’re competent, in their opinion.  But they think the doctor ought to know.  You can be the greatest doctor in the world, but if you’re in New York with a stomachache and he’s in Italy making a speech and he doesn’t have somebody covering, there’s a problem.  It’s those kinds of things.  If patients feel the doctor doesn’t call them back or doesn’t call them back reasonably quickly, that’s a real issue.  The doctor should know the patient feels that way, and other patients should know it so they pick a different doctor.\n\tWe are surveying a lot of places for something called Drinkwell, which is Diageo, largest distributor of liquor in the United States, and it’s a program where we survey the well.  In a restaurant the bar is called the well.  We’re surveying people about the quality of both their service, their knowledge about drinks, and the quality of the drinks that they serve.  The people at Diageo will make available training sessions and things like that, so if they’re not doing very well in terms of the scores, it gives them an incentive to go to school and improve.\n\nQ:  In your own business, what about things like Facebook and Twitter and all that?  Do you have a lot of people doing that?\n\nZagat:  Yes, we have a fair number, but I’m, again, the last person in this business you should ask that question to.  Everybody is talking Twitter, but I have not come to terms with Twitter.  We have people in Israel, several people, who are doing nothing but twittering for us, or tweeting or whatever.  Nina knows a lot more about that, and we have people on staff who are really, I would say, experts.  I think they have to train me a little bit on that, because Nina is on Facebook, and I think we have a Facebook account, but—\n\nQ:  I’m sure you do.\n\nZagat:  I know we do, but I’m the last person in the office who will learn about this.\n\nQ:  No, actually I meant you would have to hire people to know how to do this.\n\nZagat:  We have a bunch of people.  We have probably, oh, I don’t know, ten, fifteen at least, who are doing nothing but this, and it could be more, probably should be.  We also are in something that is important strategically; we are of the view that in order to produce quality content, you have to get paid for it.  It is insane to give away what you are selling in another platform.  We, like the Wall Street Journal, you have to be a member of our—you can get a lot of free content, and probably 80 percent of the people who come to our site are getting free content, but we are fundamentally making money consistently out of the premium memberships.  It’s going to be a very interesting issue, because I think all the newspapers are beginning to realize that they made a huge mistake and devalued the quality of their content, and, at the same time, because they devalued it, they then had to let go a lot of their writers.  I think it’s just bad for the whole field of journalism that so much of this stuff has been made available for free, and I believe that the major newspapers are now turning around and saying, “How do we get—?”\n\nQ:  They’re going to have to.\n\nZagat:  Yes, but they have damaged themselves and I think they’ve damaged a lot of their employees in the process.\n\nQ:  How do you handle the weight issues?\n\nZagat:  W-e-i-g-h-t?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nZagat:  I, obviously, don’t handle them as well as I might.  I did lose thirty pounds over the last four or five months, and I could well afford to lose another thirty pounds over the next few months.\n\nQ:  It must be impossible.\n\nZagat:  Well, it’s another thing, my mother could eat anything, and she was always thin.  My father looked like me.  It’s an issue.  But I also like to eat.\n\nQ:  Is it a health issue?\n\nZagat:  Oh, yes.  I don’t think being overweight is healthy.  I think everybody knows.  I have a trainer who comes every morning, and I go out if the weather is good in Central Park.  Otherwise, I run around the apartment.  And I try to be careful.  I had today a salad at a wonderful restaurant around the corner, and I had a half portion of spaghetti with sea urchin.\n\tHave I missed something?  Let me just see.  Have a missed anything important?  Seeing all the customized books is interesting, seeing things like that, and there’s just endless things we’re getting in.  We have a wine club that is turning out to be fantastic.\n\nQ:  That’s interesting.  You see the Wall Street Journal wine club and this wine club and that wine club, and you wonder how they’re all doing.\n\nZagat:  I don’t know how they’re doing.  I know how we’re doing.  We set a goal of—am I allowed to say?  Oh, I won’t.\n\nQ:  You’ve set a goal.  Okay.\n\nZagat:  We’ve set a goal, and we are way ahead of where our goal—\n\nQ:  Congratulations.\n\nZagat:  —in a very short period of time.  And people have said—I guess they assume that Zagat, being food, must have something they want.  And, in fact, we’ve done some things that nobody else is doing.  We’re letting everybody in the wine club rate the wines they get.  It’s all transparent, so you can see how everybody else rates the wine.  If you don’t like a wine, you just take it off your bill.  So you don’t have to send it back.  If you don’t want next week’s case or next month’s case, there’s a simple way of just saying, “Don’t send anything to me for about six months.”  But the keen difference is that everybody is able to rate it so you could see whether your point of view is shared by a lot of other people, and if you want to get more, then you can based on how everybody rated it, not just yourself.  I think it’s reassuring to know that several thousand people felt that it was good before you go and buy a case of wine.\n\tIt’s also very cheap.  The wines are selected by people who go around the world looking for very small vineyards that are too small to make it into the trade, and then they buy up the whole vineyard and obviously get very good prices.  We pick the wines that go into our people’s case, and then our people are tasting and voting, and have the right to, if they don’t like it, just chalk it off their account.\n\nQ:  What’s interesting to me about your business is that it not only has reflected exactly what’s happened in the relationship between people and food and wine in this country, but also communication, in terms of how information is communicated.\n\nZagat:  I think that, to some degree, we’re different, in that we are applying some levels of discipline to the information.  So we’re not just saying go here, talk whatever, say whatever you think about this restaurant.  We’re saying, first give us a rating on a scale of thirty on the food, on the décor, on the service.  Tell us how much you think it costs, and now talk about those key elements, focus on what we think are key elements in the experience.  We target people who are particularly avid about things, so the movie guide we have something like 18,000 to 20,000 people who see over a hundred movies a year and vote on over a hundred movies.\n\nQ:  This is just online or it’s actually a book as well?\n\nZagat:  It’s a book but all the voting is online.  The golf guide we have, I don’t know, seven thousand or eight thousand golfers, but they play on average of twenty-eight courses a year.  They’re playing in two different courses every month, which is very unusual.  I mean they really are golf course collectors, and so we’re targeting people and we’re putting them into some degree of—on the movies you have to rate the acting, the storyline, the production values and would you recommend this movie to your friends.  We know who these people are, so we know if it’s twenty-year-old men or fifty-year-old women.  We know who is saying what they’re saying, and that can be extremely different, depending on the movie.\n\tEverything we do is in some ways more organized, and we edit and at the end of the day we have all the open comments, you can see them, but then we edit them into a brief, usable review, which most of the websites are just, I mean, getting on the corner and screaming at each other.  You know it is not the same thing as having experts edit.  We have probably the leading editors of restaurant critics in every major city in the country who work for us.\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nZagat:  We have leading restaurant critics all over the country who work for us.\n\nQ:  In the sense that they give you reviews?\n\nZagat:  First they give us a list of the local restaurants that they think are important enough to be surveyed.  Two, then when the results are in, we will edit it, but then they’ll read it and say, “You didn’t get that right.”  Or, “It’s a little too enthusiastic.”  They will also be there as a backstop for accuracy, so that it’s one of the many ways we protect against the system being misused.  They will say, “That can’t be.  You’d better look at that.  You’d better check the voting again of the surveying team.  You’d better check and see what the survey [unclear].”\n\nQ:  You say you pay them, but presumably the people who comment on movies or restaurants or anything don’t get paid.\n\nZagat:  No, we have 350,000 to 400,000 people not getting paid, but sending us information.  We have about 180 people whose job it is—usually two in every city—one is to get out the vote, make sure that local people know about this is going on and vote.  The other is usually a restaurant critic or somebody very knowledgeable about local food, who will—let’s say twenty people say, “Beautiful, lovely, gorgeous restaurant.”  Okay?  But nobody says wood panel Victorian or peach postmodern.  It makes all the difference in the world.  So that the critic, the professional critic, is not allowed to change the opinion and is not allowed to touch the numbers, but can add key facts that help draw the picture of what it is we’re looking at.\n\nQ:  I know the person in Washington, so now I understand what you’re referring to.\n\nZagat:  For example, let’s say you get that restaurant unusual French food, she would say, “Yes, it’s unusual because the chef is doing Thai spices.”  We say, “Good, that adds facts,” but not opinion.\n\nQ:  I see, and that’s very helpful.\n\nZagat:  When we first started this and we first started hiring editors, we really had to work with them to get them to not say how they felt.\n\nQ:  That’s interesting.  Thank you very much.  This has been absolutely fascinating.\n\n[End of interview]\n","description":"Born on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where he and his wife Nina still live, Tim Zagat grew up in a home where food wasn't a particular focus. His mother's only food passion involved freezing foodsâ€”both before or after cooking. Her freezing habit was so strong that marked and dated packages retrieved from her freezer much later on could be identified as the 1955 Thanksgiving turkey or the 1957 Easter ham. The food Tim Zagat ate at school wasn't much better. \"Chicken a la King was a high point,\" he recalls. But his father and grandfather, who liked fine dining, set the stage for the future by taking the young man to some of the best restaurants of the 50s.\r\n\r\nAfter a few post-college years when he considered a life of politics and public service, Tim Zagat went to Yale Law School.
