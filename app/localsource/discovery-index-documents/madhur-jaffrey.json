It is December 2, 2010, and I’m with Madhur Jaffrey in her apartment in Greenwich Village in New York.\nGood afternoon.\n\nJaffrey:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we start with your telling me where and when you were born and something about your very large family.\n\nJaffrey:  I was born in Delhi.  Our house was a big house, a joint family house with my grandfather’s children and grandchildren, most of them living together in that one big house.  It was on the Jamuna River.  We called it the Jamuna River at that time, not Yamuna, which is the Sanskritized name.\nI was born at home, because in those days women generally gave birth at home.  So know the room where I was born.  It faced the river, which I loved the idea of much later as I thought about it.  The custom then was that my grandmother would come.  As soon as the child was born, they would bring a little jar of honey and she would hold the infant and write on its tongue “Om,” which means “I am,” in honey with the little finger.  So that was certainly something that happened to me.\n\nQ:  In the lineup in the family, you were—\n\nJaffrey:  Among my father’s kids, I was the fifth child, so there was one more to come.  The fifth position in a household that had two boys and two girls was actually so wonderful, because I was left alone.  My father, all his expectations fulfilled with the first four, just, I think, decided that he could enjoy me and not have great expectations of me, which did a world of wonders, I think, for me.\n\tSo I grew up partly in Delhi, but at the age of about two, I think, my father went to Kanpur, which is in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nQ:  To manage a key factory?\n\nJaffrey:  A key factory.\n\nQ:  How did that happen?\n\nJaffrey:  There were members of the large family to which we belonged, the larger family, my grandfather’s cousins and brothers.  Amongst them, there was an uncle, [unclear], my father’s cousin, who owned a string of factories of all sorts, and one was a key factory in Kanpur.  He needed a manager, and my father was the one who was picked and went to do this.\n\tSo I was born in a Hindu family with all these Hindu customs, including the [unclear], my tongue, and all the prayers and everything else that Hindus are very much a part of.  The men participated in all that religion, but to a point.  They weren’t deeply into the religion.  They left it to the women to carry on the tradition, and they sort of stayed one foot in, one foot out of strict observances.  They were part of every ceremony, but they were asked to come in.  It isn’t that they remembered and said, “We have to do this.”  This is what I remember of my grandfather’s kids and my grandfather.  They let the women carry on the business of religion and they participated, but only to a degree.\n\tNow I’m in Kanpur and my father’s left two of his kids to study in Delhi, the boys, the older boys, and they were going to be supervised by an uncle, which was quite the normal thing to do at that time.  The schools were better in Delhi and the boys could continue their education.  They were both older.  So they stayed and they went to a school which still exists today; it’s called Modern School, still one of Delhi’s best schools.\n\tThen the girls—and I was the third and there was no other at that time—for the older two, my father was looking for a school, and eventually—I think I write about this in my book as well—eventually decided on a convent, a Catholic convent with nuns doing the education.\nSo by this time we had three major influences in my life religion-wise.  My father and mother were Hindu, so there was that very much, and my mother certainly did all the festivals and all the prayers, so we were very familiar with that aspect of our lives.  Then all the men had traditionally worked in the Mughal courts, so they were very familiar with Persian.\n\nQ:  Historically.\n\nJaffrey:  Historically.  Then Urdu, because Delhi, if you know, was a city of Hindus and Muslims.  The emperor was always a Muslim, and you worked in [unclear] Muslim languages and Muslim etiquette and Muslim way of dressing and the purdah system.  So all this was also a part of our lives.\nI remember interviewing my aunts very early on, and they said that my youngest two aunts were the first two women to go to college in the family, and they went to the same college my grandfather went and my father and uncles went and my brothers went, which is another prominent college in Delhi, called St. Stephen’s.  So these two aunts would go to college and they lived in the inner city at that time, because the family is an old family from Delhi.\n\nQ:  Inner city meaning Old Delhi?\n\nJaffrey:  Old Delhi.  So they lived in Old Delhi.  In those days, my aunts used to tell the story that they would go out of their house and there were sheets that were held up on both sides so they wouldn’t be seen.  So it was like the purdah system, which they followed because it was a Muslim society pretty much at that time.  Even though the British were there, the tradition of the purdah had carried on to a certain degree, even though my grandfather was totally against it, but it was carried on, observed in the streets.  So they would walk that way to a carriage, a phaeton, which would be waiting on a slightly bigger lane, and they would get into it.  It would have curtains.\nThen they would go to college and they were the only two girls at St. Stephen’s at that time.  So two chairs would be set up in the front near the teacher, and they would sit there and the boys would cover the rest of the classroom.  When they had to play tennis, which they both loved to do, they had to play with each other.  [laughter]\nSo that was kind of the background.  So there was that Islamic background that the men really—it wasn’t just on the surface; it went far below the surface.  They had many Muslim friends.  It was nothing.  There was no distinguishing.\n\nQ:  Tell me why your family worked for the Mughal court.  Did it have to do with their sense of being scribes?\n\nJaffrey:  I think so.\n\nQ:  Can you explain what that—\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  So I come from a community which we think was founded maybe a thousand year—around the start of the A.D.s.  Well, that’s two thousand.  Sorry.  Two thousand years ago, around then.  I don’t know how it started.  I can only imagine that they felt there were some people who wanted to read and write but not necessarily religion.  The caste system was set up that the priests were the readers and writers, and then there were warriors, and then there were the traders and businessmen, and then there were sort of lower castes and the outcasts.\nSo this was the old caste system that had been set up, and I’m sure some of my ancestors wanted to be involved with the intellectual pursuits, as it were, but not be priests necessarily.  Though some of them were of the royal classes or semi-royal classes, aristocratic classes, at any rate, they felt that they should be able to read and write everything they wanted.  So somehow the other caste grew.  That was called the caste, and these were the scribes, the caste of scribes.  This is what we belonged to, and I think it could well be that when the Mughal courts needed historians or people to keep records or do the taxes, then these people were called in because they were already fully acquainted with how to do so.\nI think also we always learned the language of the rulers.  That seems to have been the history of the family, and maybe because they needed to read and write and have a job.  So they had been in the courts and had risen to the point even of being finance ministers and high up in the Mughal court, so the running of the Mughal court, as far as reading and writing was concerned, was a lot left to [unclear], and my family was certainly very much a part of that and we were from Delhi.  So the history of the family then is really a Delhi history, very much so.\nSo now where were we?\n\nJaffrey:  So the girls were in Delhi.\n\nJaffrey:  In Delhi, and they were in Kanpur.\n\nQ:  You were in Kanpur.\n\nJaffrey:  Then my father decided to add this other element, this Christian element, to this Hindu-Muslim element, because they themselves had gone to—St. Stephen’s was set up certainly by Christians of various sorts, so their background was this, that education is best from the British.  They have a good system of education and we should avail ourselves of it, and whatever is possible, that’s what we should do.  So even though my father believed in fighting for the independence of India, and he was very much fighting for independence, but where education was concerned, he was not going to compromise, and he decided that this was the best school and it would give him educated, sophisticated young ladies as daughters, and he was attracted to it and that’s where we went.\n\tI remember going to the kindergarten in my little St. Mary’s Convent in Kanpur and not knowing a word of English.  My mother didn’t speak any English.  My father spoke English.  The men spoke English; the women didn’t speak English.  They were hardly educated.  My mother had gone up to the eighth grade, but after she died, I found all these awards that she’d got.  You know, that’s how it was at that time.\n\nQ:  So with her at home, you were speaking Hindustani?\n\nJaffrey:  Hindi and Hindustani.  We would speak in Hindustani because, as you know, both Urdu and Hindi, but when my mother read us stories in bed, which she did, she read us things like detective stories she would read, she loved them, and they were all in Hindi.  They were her Hindi books and novels that she read to us.  So really that was Hindi, that wasn’t Hindustani, but when we spoke, it was Hindustani with mixtures of Urdu and Hindi, but when she read to us, it was Hindi.\n\tSo I grew up in this kind of atmosphere in Kanpur, but also really the house was literally in a compound which had the factory, it had my father’s office, it had our house with fourteen or fifteen gardens, big gardens around it, then the house of the—was it under my father?  I can’t even remember his position, but he had his big house and his compound, and there were a lot of workers’ houses, not worker-workers, but management people, their houses also, and the factory.  The whole thing was walled in.  So we were in this walled-in world with gates.\n\nQ:  Your mother was the woman in charge at that point?\n\nJaffrey:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And she loved it because she wasn’t under the influence of her mother-in-law and my father’s sisters.  They were just on their own and it was apparently a very happy time for them.  But there would be every now and then, like we have now, we used to call them riots.  They were Hindu-Muslim conflagrations; that’s the only word.  But they were outside the walls.  We were totally protected.\n\nQ:  This was before Partition?\n\nJaffrey:  This is much before Partition.  I’m talking about the thirties now.  So we would hear this and we would be sitting behind our walls, nice and comfortable and protected from this havoc that is always taking place every now and then, would flare up, you know.\n\tThen there was the Christian side.  This was a Catholic convent, and it didn’t recognize anything but Catholics and Protestants, so we were put in the Protestant corner.  So we didn’t have to go to chapel in the morning and didn’t have catechism in the morning.  We just were called Protestants and lumped with them.  At that time I didn’t think much about it and I thought, “Fine.”  Everybody was trading pictures, holy pictures, and we were trading holy pictures of Jesus and Mary.  I liked the ones with the nice colors and they were puffed up a little bit, so they were slightly three-dimensional.\n\tThe foods that we were eating at that time in school, we had the [unclear] man that used to come with a tin and his things.  His food was so, so—all candy of various sorts, but there was like a wonderful brittle that he had which we all absolutely loved, and there was a pink and white coconut candy that he had that we absolutely loved.  So there were things that were half Indian, half British, that were vetted by the nuns.  So this Muslim guy, I remember, used to have this box like a little trunk, and he would open it up and then there was all this Bali sugar I remember.  Oh, so delicious, so delicious.  So he would have all these candies that we would buy.\n\tBut the food would come from home, because this whole Hindu idea that anybody else’s food is dirty and you can’t eat it, you have to have your own food, that followed us, you know, all the way through till the late forties, I would guess.\n\nQ:  So you brought your food?\n\nJaffrey:  We didn’t bring it.  The car would drop us, then go back, bring the bearer with the food in a different carrier, and then he would lay it out on—there were tables in the back, sort of a side veranda, and he would lay out the tablecloth and put the plates and knives and forks down and lay out all the food for us, and it was usually Indian food.  Sometimes we had cheese sandwiches or something like that.  Generally it was Indian food, kabobs and rice and things like that.  Then we would eat and he would wrap it all up and take it home.\n\tThen we would get home by about—I think school ended around three o’clock.  We would get home by three-thirty or four and be hungry again, so my mother would very often be having a nap, and she would leave food for us in an oven, and we would just go in and have bits of that.  That’s when my sister invented this thing in which they would cut off a slice of bread that was really thick at the end, and take out the inner white stuff from the bread and just leave the crust, the deep crust, and then we would take whatever my mother had left, meat or potatoes, and stuff it inside and put lots of pickle on the top.  [laughs]  And have that, and we all loved that.  Oh, there would be chapatis that were left over, and we’d roll the same stuff inside and have that.  So that would be our snack.\n\tThen dinner could be anything.  It could be Indian, it could be Western, it could be mixed.  Very often we started with a soup and then we had either Western food or Indian food, and then we always had a sort of English pudding or a tart of some sort, but made by [unclear], who made it in an Indian way.  I don’t think he’d ever been abroad.  So they had their own style of cooking, and they were called [unclear].\n\nQ:  They would cook with your mother?  Your mother would supervise?\n\nJaffrey:  No.  In the house in Kanpur, we had only a large pantry attached to the house, where you could wash up, where there was a hot oven and various storage areas, but then there was a long walkway, covered walkway, that went to the kitchen.  It seemed very long, far away, and had the walls of the compound.  And there was the real kitchen.  My mother would go there and start our dishes.  Like if there was a chicken curry, she would get all the masalas browned and the chicken browned, and then she would let them finish the cooking.  But we generally didn’t see that, because we were in the house doing our homework.  I remember occasionally seeing my mother cooking.  I have one memory of her cooking in that kitchen and making a chicken curry.  That’s why I remember it.\nBut generally speaking, the servants took care of it and she supervised it, but basically she was in the house, because when my father came home from work, he would have his tea and relax and then he would turn on the news.  We had a big Philips radio, I remember, and he would listen to the news and drink his scotch and soda, which my grandfather did, my father did, I did, and listen to the news.\nSo it became very interesting during the war, because one of my father’s cousins had married a German woman and had ended up in Germany during the war, and we found that he was broadcasting for the Nazis, so that was really sort of a shock, but my father listened to him every day and listened to whatever was coming from the other side.  So there was that and there was sort of the British side of it.  We were all getting the news, the BBC, which we heard all the time, so we were getting, in a way, more than one angle. \nAnother thing that was happening, you’d heard about the INA, the Indian National Army.  So they had joined together in Burma and were marching, I think, with the Japanese help, towards India to free India from the British.  So there were conflicting things going on in India at that particular time, where World War II was concerned.  I know we were all preparing for the worst.  My father had the windows blackened.  We had trenches dug up.  We were all ready for anyone to come and attack us, but we didn’t know who was coming.  [laughs]  Was it the Japanese who were coming to free India or what?  But that was a very interesting time.\nThere was petrol rationing, so the car was out, and my father got a horse and carriage, and we would go to school with the horse and carriage.  There was a German guy that was working with the factory, some technical aspect of the factory.  He was interred.  Is that the word, interned?  Interned.  Interred is down there.  [laughs]  Interned.  But he had a dog, German shepherd, so he didn’t know what to do with the dog, and my father offered to take the dog.  So we had our first dog.  That was our first dog.  Then we had other dogs.  Wolfie, as he was called, led us into this new world of dogs, which we knew little about.\n\nQ:  Did the rationing affect your food at all?\n\nJaffrey:  The rationing?  Yes.  Everything was rationed, including gas.  So things like grains were rationed, but we grew so much also, you see.  Our garden didn’t produce grain, but produced everything else.  We had our own cow and milk.  We had all our own vegetables.  We had onion, potatoes, garlic, all that stuff.  We didn’t have chickens; we bought meat from outside.  So grain for us was the problem.\nBut the biggest problem was petrol.  For that we had to give up the car during that period.  My father was a great—I mean, he always changed the cars and got the latest American or English car.  I remember riding in a rumble seat in the car, and he always had that.  He was a car person.\n\nQ:  He was gorgeous.  Those pictures of him are extraordinary.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, he was a good-looking man and he was a man about town a little bit.  He played bridge, he played tennis, badminton, and he smoked.  [laughs]  And drank scotch and dressed nattily.  He was a good dresser and so on.\n\tSo that life abruptly came to an end a little after the war had started.  I’m trying to think.  I was about twelve, so it must have been 1943, ’44, something like that, that my father decided to give up that job and we all went back.  My grandfather was getting ill and he wanted everyone around him.  My father was, I don’t know, very obedient and part of the joint family system where you go where your father wants you to be and not make your own decisions.  My grandfather made all decisions for my father, major decisions like what land to buy to move out.  My father made none of them, to my regret.\n\tBut anyway, so we went back to Delhi and we all hated it.  We were so used to our little quiet, wonderful, contained life.  But it turned out that Delhi was a huge cosmopolitan city and we saw then, of course, and we got closer and closer to Partition.\n\tThen I go back and I have no school to go to.  I have a find a school.  So my sisters were sent to a convent in Nanital, in the hills, so they were there in a school convent called Ramni, so it was a continuation of the same nuns, same order that was up there in Nanital.  But I was considered a little young to just be sent up there.  I had a younger sister by that time, so the two of us went back to Delhi and were put in a school called Queen Mary School, which was a missionary school, and was a missionary school for [unclear] girls, really, from the inner city.  So it had been set up that way, and anyone else could go there as well, but again, the system of education was supposedly better than—I tried a convent, and the convent had an English section and an Indian section, and I was put in the Indian section and I hated it to such a degree and I felt, “They’re stupid here.  Nobody knows anything.  The teachers know nothing.  The girls know nothing.  Only the dumb people are put here.”\n\nQ:  What language was it taught in?\n\nJaffrey:  It was taught in English, but it was dumbed down in the Indian section to such a degree that I totally rebelled.  It was like segregation, you know, really, and I could afford to rebel.  My father said, “All right.  You don’t want to stay, we take you out.”  And then I was put in this Queen Mary’s, which was the missionary school.\n\tBut the trouble was that I think I moved there when I was eleven and a half or twelve, and until thirteen everything was taught in Urdu or Hindi, and I knew neither.  I didn’t know how to write either one of them.  It was really like starting in class one.  I was so used to being the head of the class and not having to worry about not doing well, and suddenly I couldn’t read the alphabet, you know.  It was awful.\n\nQ:  This was Urdu or Hindi?\n\nJaffrey:  I had to choose.  So it was a very, very difficult decision.  My heart was in Urdu because I loved the sound of Urdu, but something very practical in me said, “Let’s do Hindi.  I should learn Hindi,” and I did Hindi.  But it was an alien—you know when you speak Hindustani, so unlike what you listen on the radio to, it’s just a totally different language, and the vocabulary I didn’t know, certainly the grammar.  I didn’t know the vocabulary and I didn’t know how to read and write.\nSo I learned.  I learned it.  It was very hard, very hard, but I did it and it was only for about a year and a half or two years, because then the whole thing changed.  In high school it all changed to English, and then it was okay.  We still had Hindi as a subject, but every other subject was in the English language, rather than having geography in Hindi and history in Hindi.  So I just had that hard struggle, but it was very good for me because I mastered Hindi and I’ll never, ever say that that was hard, because it was such a good thing.  I would never have learned it otherwise.\n\nQ:  What were the family meals like when you came back?\n\nJaffrey:  The house, which is no longer there, my grandfather’s house, there was a main house in the center.  The back was the river.  Either side were two courtyards, and beyond the courtyards was sort of brick annexes running from the river to inland.  They were high up.  The road was much further down because of flooding and things like that, so we were really off the ground quite a bit.  But one annex was where one of my uncles lived, and there were guest rooms all along, and my grandfather, he was a barrister, his office, and other guest rooms.  On the other wide, on the north side, there was the long, long, long dining room and pantries and kitchen.  So you would have to go from the main house through the courtyard, which is open, so when it was raining, you ran to the dining room.\n\tIt depended.  Every day people could have what they wanted.  It was sort of hotel-like in that sense.  If you wanted a fried egg—most people had eggs in the morning.\n\nQ:  This is breakfast.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, I’m starting at breakfast.  So any kind of egg you wanted, toast.  As children, we had milk.  We weren’t allowed tea or coffee or anything like that.  The older people had tea, but we always had glasses of milk.  So that was usually breakfast.\n\tLunch, if we were home, it probably was a weekend, that’s when we were home, and it would be usually a wonderful lunch, always some kind of meat, which was always goat, always three or four vegetables, and some kind of dal, lots of little yogurt-y things, salady-y things, pickles, which my grandmother made, all kinds of different kinds of pickles, and always, always, always fruit, winter or summer.  Dessert, there was always fruit, and if it was summer, there’d be mangos or cantaloupes, different things.  According to the season, there would just be a ton of fruit for everybody to eat.\n\nQ:  And in winter?\n\nJaffrey:  Oranges.  It was always the more Western fruit, oranges, apples, bananas.  Bananas are not Western, but things that people know over here.  I didn’t really like the winter fruit.  Guavas, that was a nice fruit that we always had in the winter, which I loved.  But it was more boring fruits.  The best fruit for me was the summer, the mangos, the lychees, the [unclear], all that.  But whatever there was, there was always a ton of fruit, great fruit of various sorts.\n\nQ:  This was laid out for you to take on a buffet?\n\nJaffrey:  Well, it depended.  The food was brought to the table, the main dishes, and it was a long table that had been extended three times by adding on other tables, because there were usually about thirty of us eating, and the kids sat at one end, the river end.  We were always on that side.  My grandfather sat facing the river, always at the head of the table on the other side.  It sort of deteriorated and became benches at the end, and at the head of the table was proper chairs.  My grandfather apparently bought a lot of the stuff at auctions, at various auctions.  He was a great man for going to auctions and buying stuff, so the furniture was basically from auction houses of various sorts.\nThe food for the main course would all be laid out, but everything would repeat itself, meat three times at least, big bowls of it, so everyone helped themselves and it was pass on.  Chapatis would come fresh again and again and again.  Everything would be replenished as it was finished.  In the winter there would be a lot of game, because the men went hunting, so there’d be deer and goose and duck and quail and partridge.\n\nQ:  Did you get up and get your food?\n\nJaffrey:  No, it was just passed along.  It was put along the table in the center of each of the three or four tables, however many there were.\n\nQ:  And even the children could take what they wanted?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, whatever they wanted.  Sometimes their mothers served them.  The mothers were allowed to do that.  They could serve their own kids if they wanted to, but I don’t remember my mother ever doing that.  We always served ourselves.  I know other mothers did, because they wanted their kids to get choice pieces of this and that, controlling it.  [laughs]\n\tThen at the end, sometimes before the ladies of the house would peel, if it was mangos, they would peel a whole ton of mangos and put them in the fridge, and then the whole thing would come out again on plates.  Or if there were fewer people, then they might peel and pass on the fruit, but somebody always did that.\n\nQ:  And your lunches at school, were they still brought to you?\n\nJaffrey:  By the time I was a teenager, we took our lunches in little tiffin carriers.  I used to bicycle to school, and I would have my tiffin carrier hanging from my bike and I would take it.  We would sit with all our friends and eat together.  Everyone would bring their tiffin carriers and we would share, Hindus, Muslims, no problem at that time, till just before ’47.\nThen it became a major problem and a fearful problem, because suddenly nobody was getting along.  It can happen.  I think Partition is the worst thing that can happen to a nation, the worst.  It brings out the worst in people and it just leaves nobody happy, I think. \n\nQ:  At school you had Muslims?\n\nJaffrey:  Half the class was Muslim, at least, and suddenly from being very good friends with everybody, we were not.  Nobody wanted to talk to the other side.  And I remember such a feeling of aloneness, feeling that, “I’m in the middle.  I think like nobody thinks.  I’m not on this side, I’m not on that side.  What side am I on?  Who am I?”  I was twelve, thirteen, so it was a bad time anyway, and then to have this inflicted on one made it even harder, because you felt really, “Where do I belong?”  I wasn’t a Muslim and I didn’t agree with the Hindus either.  So that was how that was.\n\nQ:  Then during the fighting, did you continue to go to school?\n\nJaffrey:  We continued to go to school except on certain days when there was too much violence and everyone stayed home.  Nobody went anywhere.  I remember my father and uncles, all the men taking guns and their hunting rifles—it’s all they had—and parading the whole area that all our houses were in.  We were in what used to be an orchard once, and it was all family houses.\nThis parading and at one time somebody came and said, “The gangs are coming from the other side,” and we could hear them.  Everybody moved like a mob, you know.  Terrible fear, what would happen to the men.  But it passed.  It passed.  Then at one point there was another mob somewhere else, and my uncle said, “I have to go.”\nWe said, “Don’t go.  Please don’t go.  You’ll be killed.”\nHe said, “No, my friend is trapped there.”  He had a friend who was a doctor, and the doctor was trapped and the mob was coming.  He somehow got through, but his friend was shot dead.  I mean, that happened everywhere.  It happened everywhere, people killing people just because they were of another religion, you know.\n\nQ:  And the food supplies were interfered with?\n\nJaffrey:  You couldn’t go out and shop, so people had what they had and made do, made do.  Usually in our kind of house, so much is put away.  There’s a ton of grain, a lot of vegetables are grown, and even if you don’t have fresh vegetables, you have onions, garlic, ginger, pickles, you know, dals.  You can always eat.  I never felt a shortage during that period.\n\nQ:  During and after Partition, then what happened in terms of how your life was constructed?\n\nJaffrey:  Well, it didn’t just end like that, because then followed that million people being killed, with Hindus going towards India, Muslims going towards Pakistan, and all those killings on the trains.  Trains would arrive with dead people, you know, horrible things like that on both sides.  Both sides did incomprehensible things to each other.\n\tThen half the girls were gone in my class, just gone.  Some may have been killed, some went away.  I never saw any, not one of them again.  My father’s friends, some of them stayed, some of them left.  My brother’s friends mostly left.  I actually talked to one the last time I was in Pakistan.  I actually managed to call one of my brother’s friends.  I found him and he was dying of cancer, but I managed to speak to him.\nBut my father’s friends, it was so interesting, there was one house on what was then called Barakhamba Road.  I don’t know what that road is called now.  It has some other name.  Anyway, it was one of the main roads in New Delhi.  He was a very wealthy man, had a big house there, and they all left.  The house was empty and bare for a long, long time, but there were servants’ quarters at the back, which were taken over by a family of refugees, and they also were a wealthy family in the Punjab, and they came and took over.  There were five girls, and my sister became very friendly with one of the girls, of one of the five girls, so it was kind of ironic that a lot of men left this family, then another family came in the servants’ quarters and one became my sister’s best friend.  Actually, one worked as Mrs. Gandhi’s secretary, was with her till the end when she died.\nSo people were replaced by other people, and refugees poured into Delhi, poured into Delhi, changing Delhi.  What year did you come?\n\nQ:  It was right after the Bangladesh war, so it was in ’73, I think.\n\nJaffrey:  By the fifties, Delhi was like a refugee town.  There were refugees everywhere.  Any open area had become an encampment of refugees.  There were new markets.  Delhi was growing by leaps and bounds, new extensions here, there, but all suddenly, and everybody spoke with a different accent.  There was the Punjabi accent that people in Delhi weren’t used to.  The whole spirit of Delhi was very elitist, I suppose, at least the people we knew, of a Hindu-Muslim kind of background, and that all changed.  It became a different city with much more energy.  The Punjabis brought lots of fresh energy and enterprise into the system.\n\nQ:  I found that they also brought tandoori.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.\n\nQ:  If you could talk about that and how the food changed in that respect.\n\nJaffrey:  What happened was that we didn’t really go out to eat, because, again, this whole idea of food being pure and clean and all that, except my father broke the rule all the time for certain Muslim dishes which could be had only behind the Red Fort, you know.\n\nQ:  In a stall or something.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  Behind the [unclear] there were all these Muslim lovely stalls with certain kinds of breads which he loved and certain kinds of kabobs which he had grown up with in the inner city.  He’d grown up with all these things.  All this thing about dirty food, this, that, and the other, he broke the rule himself all the time because the driver would go out with our utensils, our napkins, and they would come back looking like they were made in the cleanest kitchen, with fresh white napkins on top, and then he thought everything was fine.\n\tBut the food changed because the Punjabis have a much more enterprising spirit than we did in Delhi.  We were rather effete.  They opened restaurants.\n\nQ:  That was unusual?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  Restaurants that we would go to, upper-crust restaurants, in Connaught Place there were restaurants, expensive restaurants that you could go and have Russian food.  [laughs]  Things like that.  And good Indian food, but Punjabi food.  Then Moti Mahal was a very humble restaurant in [unclear], which sort of connects Old Delhi in a way to New Delhi, but it’s in Old Delhi, and it wasn’t an upper-crust restaurant at all, but we all discovered it because it had the great tandoori chicken, and we’d never seen a tandoori in our lives.  It was, to us, new, nouvelle cuisine of a certain sort.  And we hadn’t had meat that was like rare.  We hadn’t had chickens that were this juicy.  We’d never had anything like that.  The naan was something we did not know at all in North India, and we did not know the khalida, the way it was cooked in the oven over twenty-four hours.  So all this was very new and very exciting.\n\nQ:  And all these were at Moti Mahal?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  Moti Mahal started it, and of course today nobody can think of Indian food without tandoori chicken, but it was really one restaurant that started it for all of us.\n\nQ:  Were you allowed to go?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, we were allowed to go.\n\nQ:  Did you ever bring it back home?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, we did.  We brought it back home, we took it on picnics.  It was all considered okay.  It was hot food, so it was considered pretty much okay.  Don’t ask me why.\n\nQ:  Safe.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, safe.\n\nQ:  But it didn’t change the way you in your homes would have cooked?\n\nJaffrey:  No, no, no.  You’d go back and it was all the same.  Nothing changed at home.  Absolutely the same dishes, and we wanted them.  We wanted them the same way, because we loved them.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we go back to your schooling and how that continued.\n\nJaffrey:  Well, I think what had happened in Kanpur was I had already worked out what I was good at and what I wasn’t good at.  I certainly was not good at math.  I was great at needlework and I was great at anything to do with English, English literature.  I was great at history.  I was very good at geography.  I couldn’t sing.  I knew that early.  My sisters could.  I couldn’t.  But I certainly could write and I was a good student.  Math I always managed to do, managed to learn enough to ace it, but never liked it, never liked what it made me do and made me think, and I didn’t want to think that way.\n\tSo when I came to Delhi, I continued that.  I was again very good at history, geography, English.  Again, I struggled with math.  And then discovered in high school that you could have a choice.  You could do either higher math, which was algebra, geometry, mathematics, or lower math, which was arithmetic and what they called domestic science.  [laughs]  We had a teacher from—I don’t know, she seemed to be from England in the 1930s, who would teach us, for example, how to wash clothes. \n\nQ:  Oh, it was domestic science.  [laughs]\n\nJaffrey:  So you take a scrub board and you go like this on the scrub board.  I said, “Okay.”  And then cooking, and the cooking was British invalid cookery.\n\nQ:  Ai-yi-yi.\n\nJaffrey:  It was really, really awful, but I said, “Okay, I can learn this.  I can learn the corn flour pudding recipe,” and whatever there was.  “I can do this.”  But very strangely enough, when it came to the high school exam, we were independent by then, and some bright-eyed inspector must have said, “Why are we making these girls make this blancmange and this awful soup and stuff?  Why don’t we just give them some Indian spices and say, ‘Cook’?”  Well, I wasn’t ready for that, so I couldn’t make any [unclear] mashed potatoes.  They gave us onion, garlic, ginger, tomatoes, spices, and light a fire.  They gave us wooden matches.  I didn’t get too far with that, and I probably failed that, but won out on the arithmetic and needlework, which I was very good at, which was also part of this whole domestic science-mathematics package.  So I did all right in school.\n\nQ:  When did the acting come in?\n\nJaffrey:  Well, I was acting since the convent days.  I couldn’t sing, so I couldn’t get the big parts like my sisters, but I hopped around as a brown mouse and did other things.  [laughs]  Then the minute I came to Delhi, it became more serious, because they were doing Shakespeare in school.  I remember playing Robin Hood.  It was an all-girls’ school, so I got to play Hamlet, I got to play wonderful parts, all the parts that you wanted to play.  I played Titania in Midsummer Night’s Dream in school.  This is all school.  So I was acting all the time in school and acting in college, from the beginning.\n\nQ:  You knew you were good at it or you enjoyed it?\n\nJaffrey:  I just enjoyed it at that time.  I had no sense of it as a serious vocation.  I just enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nQ:  And that was okay with your parents?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, because I was in school and there was no question of doing it any other way in school.\n\nQ:  How did you get then to the scholarship that took you to RADA [Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]?\n\nJaffrey:  So then I was in college, Miranda House in Delhi, and then I did my B.A. in English and acted throughout school, and joined an amateur theatrical company called—you must have known them.  You must have known them.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  This is a continuation of my interview with Madhur Jaffrey.\n\nJaffrey:  So when I was a kid, we used to go to see Shakespeare down by St. Stephen’s College.  They always did an annual Shakespeare play, as a kid, I remember even at the age of three or four.  So Shakespeare was very much—we all knew Shakespeare.  We recited Shakespeare, just grew up with Shakespeare.  Indian kids, at least when I was growing up, we all grew up with Shakespeare.\n\tI remember when Dame Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, came to India and they were performing at St. Stephens College, here were all these kids mouthing the words because we knew everything.  They said, “We’ve never seen anybody react this way to Shakespeare.  We have not seen it in all our travels.”  Because we were the perfect colony that way, you know.  We loved Shakespeare.\n\nQ:  Did they have a sort of traveling troupe?\n\nJaffrey:  The two of them were going around together doing Shakespeare.  But here was an audience that really was waiting for them.\nThen remember Felicity Kendal and that group?  They had their company that went around doing Shakespeare.  And everybody lapped all this up because we considered Shakespeare ours.\nI remember my daughters were at school, Nightingale-Bamford, a school in New York, and I was complaining that they knew so little of Shakespeare, and how can you go through school and not know Shakespeare, and somebody said, “Why don’t you come and teach.”  So I did, very briefly, and nobody was familiar with Shakespeare, nobody.  How can that happen?\n\nQ:  Again, to get you to the scholarship stage—\n\nJaffrey:  So here I am, joined the Unity Theatre.\n\nQ:  This is as well as school?\n\nJaffrey:  Doing college and joined the Unity Theatre and doing all kinds of plays like Christopher—\n\nQ:  Marlowe?\n\nJaffrey:  Not Marlowe.  Much later, twentieth century.  Christopher—anyway, the name will come to me.  Sorry about that.\n\tAnyway, doing modern plays, doing Shaw, doing Sartre, The Eagle has Two Heads, all kinds of plays, but in the English language.  Unity Theatre did everything at that time in the English language.  So, various people had come to see me who worked at the British Council through the years.\n\tThen suddenly I found myself—there was an award that the English government was giving to Indian artists in different cultural fields.  So you could apply as a painter, you could apply as a sculptor, anything, any of the cultural areas, arts, any of the arts.  So I applied as an actress and I got that award, which is a small amount of money, but I asked if—in those days you couldn’t take foreign currency.  There was no foreign currency allowed.  You couldn’t take it out.  So I applied to use it in England, because at that time there was no drama school in Indian, none.  So I asked if I could use it in England and they said yes.  But it wasn’t going to be enough money.\n\tSo then I was doing a play, Tennessee Williams’ short one-act, called Auto-da-Fé, and the head of the British Council came to see me and thought I was good enough to warrant one of their scholarships.  So I had an Indian scholarship, I had that scholarship, and then I couldn’t get a scholarship until I auditioned, which meant going to RADA to audition, and I auditioned there and I got another scholarship.  So then I was all right.  I had three of these not huge scholarships, but three scholarships, enough to get me going.\n\nQ:  You thought of this as a professional—\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, I was now thinking that this is what I wanted to do in life, was act.\n\nQ:  Just out of curiosity, what were your brothers and sisters doing?\n\nJaffrey:  My father was in business, so my brothers were in business.  My eldest sister had gone to England and she became a schoolteacher in England and stayed, and eventually rose to the head of the English department in the English school system.  So she was there.  My next sister got married and never worked, and my younger sister joined Swissair and worked at Swissair.\n\nQ:  So there was no resistance to having the children—\n\nJaffrey:  No, not for working.  My father just felt that I should be in the Foreign Service.  He said, “You should sit for the Foreign Service exam.”  He felt I could do it, and he just saw me was an ambassador to some place, I think, and I did not see myself that way, and I said I didn’t want to.\n\nQ:  But that’s very forward-thinking.\n\nJaffrey:  Of my father, yes.  He was.  He was really forward-thinking and wanted the best for his children.  He somehow had great hopes for me in areas that I had no interest in.\n\nQ:  So you got on a plane?  How did you do this?\n\nS:  Then I had this scholarship and I was—I don’t know, I must have been twenty-something, very early twenties, and I was ready to go.  I totally knew that this part of my life was not the fulfilled part of my life, that something else was waiting that would be the life.  I just knew it.\nSo my father took me to Bombay and I remember we spent a night at the Taj Hotel, which we’d done many times, so my history with the Taj goes back since I was twelve years old.  Then the next day, he put me on a boat.  It was one of the P&O liners.\n\nQ:  That’s a long ride.\n\nJaffrey:  Twenty-one days at that time, and it went through the Suez Canal, which either had blown up already, the whole thing with the war.  The Suez War of ’57 had either happened already and was sort of getting sorted out, but we went through the Suez Canal and I saw Aden for the first time, went through the Red Sea, through the Mediterranean.  It was quite exciting.  And then to Southampton and then to London.  And I loved it.\n\nQ:  Where did you live?\n\nJaffrey:  Eventually I lived in several places and moved because I didn’t like the landladies.  One used to read my letters, and there was another one who did something else awful.  I ended up with a very young couple.  They were a Jewish couple in a very Jewish neighborhood, a young Mr. and Mrs. Gold.  They were probably my age or maybe two years older or something like that, and they had one little baby when I was there, and while I was there they had another little baby, and I used to babysit for them.  That’s where I made my first Indian food.  They included me in everything, and every evening at ten o’clock they would have tea and I would sit and have tea and biscuits with them.\nIt was in their living room that I first saw that wonderful April Fool’s Day thing with the spaghetti growing on the tree.  Have you seen that one ever?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nJaffrey:  You haven’t seen that?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nJaffrey:  So the news was on, and we used to listen to the ten o’clock news or whatever it was every night with our tea and our biscuits that they had, and, “This thing that we have just discovered, that the way to grow the best spaghetti is—,” and then the camera rolls, and there they are on these trees with the spaghetti hanging, and they said, “To get it to the same height so it fits into the box, we want each of them to be of the same length so then they can be packaged more easily.”  It was a gorgeous little documentary, and everybody’s saying, “What?  What?”  And the next day, of course, they said April Fool’s Day.  But that was the first day they showed it, and they’ve shown it again since.  It’s just such a wonderful little snippet of fun.\n\tSo anyway, I was staying with this really, really lovely couple.  The husband died when he was forty.  I remember I was doing Medea at the Lyric Theatre in London, and the wife came to see me and we sort of caught up, Mrs. Gold, Blanche Gold, came to see me and we talked again.\nSo I started cooking.  The first dish I made was a potato dish in their kitchen.\n\nQ:  Let’s talk about that.  What got you to writing to your mother for help?  You were eating British food, presumably.\n\nJaffrey:  Terrible British food, which was really—lunch was [unclear] and in the canteen, and it was horrible.  It was this gray roast beef sliced thin, with cabbage, watery cabbage and watery potatoes, and I would just go crazy.  I said, “There must be something better than this.”  Any Indian restaurant that I tried was awful.  [unclear] had a restaurant.  I think there were very few.  I went to the one on Regent Street, whatever its name is.  It’ll come back to me.  It was awful, and that had been there since 1926.  Veeraswamy.  So I thought, this is nothing like Indian food.\n\tSo then I wrote to my mother and I said, “Please help me how to cook.  I don’t know anything.  I can’t make tea.  I can’t make rice.”  So she started sending me letters.\n\nQ:  What did you start out with?\n\nJaffrey:  With what I asked for.  I asked for a potato dish, I asked for a cauliflower dish, and I asked for one goat, lamb dish which is made with whole spices, and I knew it was simple to make, which I loved when I was in India.\n\nQ:  How did you know it was simple?\n\nJaffrey:  You know, this is the thing.  This is what I have realized in retrospect, that obviously I had a very good palette since birth, and obviously I was recording what I was eating and had a great sense of how it was made, even though I never watched it being made, but I could taste.  If you eat one thing, cumin, ten times in ten different ways, you know how it’s been used.  You just sense.\n\nQ:  Actually, that’s amazing, to take an example like a spice.  I think you would know how it was being used, but many people wouldn’t have the taste memory.\n\nJaffrey:  That’s it.  If you have a palette, you’re recording.  And if you’re recording, you have a taste memory.  This is a thing that you find out later.  There has to be a taste memory or you wouldn’t be able to bring it back.  And my mother’s recipes, which were like a little bit of this, a little bit of that, I was able to adjust it because I already had a sense of, “Oh, I think I put too much,” of this or that.\n\nQ:  You would try to make it [unclear].\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, and it was easy to adjust and it was easy to remember the taste exactly.  And that’s why I knew it was simple, because the meat hadn’t been browned, this, that, and the other, and there were just two or three things in it, and it was just so delicious.  So I thought, “I think I should be able to do that.”  And I probably heard somebody say it’s a very easy thing.  I don’t know.  But that somehow was in the back of my head always, so I was able, with those rather simple recipes, to make a whole lot of things.\n\nQ:  Where could you get spices?\n\nJaffrey:  Very close to RADA.  There was a place called the Bombay Emporium just off Euston Street, and I could just go after class and pick up whatever I needed.\n\nQ:  And you had enough money to do that?\n\nJaffrey:  Oh, yes.  My father couldn’t send me too much money, but whenever he could, he did, and then I had my scholarships.  I was fine.  I always live within my means, and I managed.  I even went on holidays to Europe.\n\nQ:  What did you do about the cooking equipment?\n\nJaffrey:  Whatever the Golds had, they used.  I was living with them and they said, “Use anything you want,” and I did.  They were very sweet about it.  Then, you see, I was making this potato dish, but I couldn’t make any Indian breads.  This was, as I said, a Jewish neighborhood, and they had a great baker.  I would go to the bakery and get pumpernickel bread, which I had never seen before in my life, and I would eat my pumpernickel bread with the Indian food, and I thought it was delicious.  It was delicious.\n\nQ:  And now you live in the home of pumpernickel [unclear].  [laughter]\n\tDid you continue to stay with the Golds long?\n\nJaffrey:  I stayed with them until I left, till I left RADA.  I finished RADA.\n\nQ:  So that was two years?\n\nJaffrey:  Two years.  And then I came to America, and I stayed with them till I left.\nI have the same pencil and the same pen as you.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  So what made you go to America?\n\nJaffrey:  Well, at that time I was involved with Saeed [Jaffrey], and he also tried to get a scholarship like I had, but he got one to America and it was at Catholic University.  He ended up there with a drama scholarship.\n\nQ:  You knew him in India?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, we worked at the Unity Theatre.  I met him at the Unity Theatre.  Then he was in radio and I worked in radio too.  You know, radio was another part of my life, because as kids, we lived near a radio station, and every time they needed kids, our family—they had very good expression, those kids from that household, so we were called.  We did radio plays and whatever was needed as kids.  Then when Doordarshan, this big radio station, opened up in New Delhi, we were called there, so all through school I was doing plays when kids were needed.\n\nQ:  On India radio?\n\nJaffrey:  On India radio.  Then in college, I was working as a disc jockey, you know, reading—\n\nQ:  How did you do that?\n\nJaffrey:  It was just a job and I did it at night.  I did the night part of it.\n\nQ:  No kidding.\n\nJaffrey:  A bus would come.  Not a bus, a car.  The radio station would send a car, pick you up and take you back at night.\n\nQ:  Your parents were really amazing.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, they had no problem because they thought I was safe.\n\nQ:  This was a time when you met Ruth Jhabvala?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  So one of my earliest plays, I think it must have been college, I don’t think it was high school, could have been high school, either high school or early college, so I’d been doing radio stuff forever.  She was casting.  I went there on a casting call for this [unclear], and that’s how I actually talked to Ruth for the first time.  I think I may have seen or met her at the Regal Theatre, which is where I have this memory of a ballet performance or something like that, and we were all there.  I think I saw her and Jhab at that time.\n\nQ:  So there was this tiny Polish-British woman.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, married to a very funny guy.\n\nQ:  A wonderful guy.\n\nJaffrey:  We got to know each other immediately and saw each other.  I don’t know why we started.  I think Saeed also.  And, actually, Ruth won’t admit it, but her first novel, her very first novel is about Saeed and me, so you have to read it.  It changed its name.  Amrita: Or to Whom She Will.  I think that was the original name.  It’s really about two people in a radio station who fall in love, and the girl is from my neighborhood.  So you know where she’s got the idea.  She said, “No, no, no, no, no.”  So that’s her first novel.  So obviously I knew her before that, before she wrote that.\n\nQ:  Did you stay in touch at all while you were in England or after you got to America?\n\nJaffrey:  Not really.  We didn’t stay actively in touch, but then after Jim [Ivory] met her, when he came to do The Householder, I knew Jim and Ismail [Merchant] before.  I knew her.  I knew them.  Then they were going to do their first film in India, which was The Householder.\n\nQ:  Let’s first get you from the U.S. back.  Let’s do New York first.\n\nJaffrey:  Okay.  So now where are we?\n\nQ:  You and Saeed were in New York?\n\nJaffrey:  No, we were in Washington [D.C.].  He was at Catholic University and I joined him there and we got married and we came to New York.  We lived on 26th Street.  I was just there and I was looking at the house.  It’s was called O’Henry’s House on 26th Street, between Sixth and Broadway.  We had three kids very quickly, sort of in a row.\n\nQ:  Just to interject a little bit, you say it as though it was perfectly normal for you to marry a Muslim.\n\nJaffrey:  My father, actually, I asked him before we left, that this was what I was—so I had Saeed come over and my father looked at him, and afterwards he said—and he used to chew thirty-two times or almost that much, and you’d ask him a question and he’d answer and then he would chew and then he’d wait for the next part to come.  So anyway, he ended up by saying, “I don’t mind him being an actor, but he looks very pale.  I think he’s not well.”  [laughter]  So that’s how we left it.  So anyway, I think they knew we were going to get married, and we did.\n\nQ:  And the religious problem was not—\n\nJaffrey:  Not with my family, because my father always felt that he was very liberal and behaved like a very liberal man.  I think his objection was that he had no profession that had steady money.  My sister also married a Muslim, but she married a doctor, so that was okay for my father.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  I can see that.\n\nJaffrey:  That he was fine with, but me, he said, “She’s a crazy girl and she’s going to do what she’s going to do.”  I think he had no great expectations of me other than he saw great potential in me, and I think he enjoyed my company because I was such a—\n\nQ:  Live wire.\n\nJaffrey:  Live wire, yes.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  So where and when did you get married?\n\nJaffrey:  We got married in 1958, in Washington.\n\nQ:  You presumably were comfortable in the kitchen at that point.\n\nJaffrey:  I wasn’t cooking at that time.  I started cooking when I came to New York.  We came to New York then.\n\nQ:  When was that?\n\nJaffrey:  1958 we came to New York.  We had no money, so I started working as a guide at the U.N., because I could get a visa for the U.N. and work as a guide, and Saeed was working with the Indian government, doing public relations with the Indian Tourist Office.  So that’s how we were sustaining ourselves, and then we were taking on off-Broadway plays of all kinds.  Saeed was in a play by Lorca.  I think it was Blood Wedding at the Actors’ Playhouse.  I have a picture of me standing in front of the Actors’ Playhouse, very pregnant with my eldest daughter, but it’s only from here.  So I think Jim went to see that play and he had done his first or second little documentary.\n\nQ:  But you didn’t know him?\n\nJaffrey:  No, we did not.  It was The Sword and the Flute, and it was about a miniature painting which he was very interested in.  He was a collector.  He wanted somebody to narrate it, and he thought Saeed would be the perfect person.  So that’s how Jim came into our lives.  Ismail was looking for a way to get going.  He was terribly ambitious.\n\nQ:  He was in Bombay?\n\nJaffrey:  He was in Bombay and he had come as a student to NYU [New York University], a business student.\n\nQ:  I didn’t know that.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  He was still in school, and dreams were big.  He had heard of Saeed, because we were quite well known in Indian, were known in the sense of amateur theater, people knew who we were and we had done a lot of stuff together in India, and he wanted to do something with us.  It was as if he was looking to move up the ladder.  He said, “We’ll do a play together.”  I remember him on one side, Saeed on the other side, arguing.  I had given birth to my first daughter.  They were arguing what they should do and what they couldn’t do, and Saeed was feeling taken advantage of.  Anyway, there was this big battle going on on either side of me.  They were thinking of doing a Sanskrit play together, then Saeed was dreaming about bringing Sitara Devi to dance in Radio City Music Hall, you know.  I was trying to tell him, “I don’t think this is going to happen, Ismail.”  But nothing stopped him.  That was the great thing about Ismail.\n\tSo we would invite Ismail.  I would cook.  Meera was a very little girl at that time, and I would cook and we would all talk about our plans.  Then Jim joined this group as well, because we knew one and we knew the other in different ways.  I can’t remember exactly how it happened, but sometime we said, “You must meet Jim.”  We were talking about doing a film together.\n\nQ:  You and Jim?  Or you and Saeed and Jim?\n\nJaffrey:  Saeed and me and Jim.  The whole idea, Jim had an apartment on East 64th Street, it was a brownstone.  It was an apartment, a brownstone.  We’d sit on the floor—there wasn’t much furniture—and write out the script, because at that time Saeed and I planned to go back to India, start a traveling company and tour with it.  We started writing this script down.  Then when Jim went to do The Householder, which he then somehow—I can’t remember the sequence.  Let me just say it this way.  He went to do The Householder and met the Kendals, because Shashi [Kapoor] was the star in it.  Then he decided the Shakespeare Wallah story came into it.\nMeanwhile, Saeed and I had divorced and Jim was mad at Saeed and didn’t want him in any way in any part of this.\n\nQ:  Because of the divorce?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, the way he’d behaved, etc., etc.  So he was going to cut him out of it, this whole thing, anyway.  So the idea of Shakespeare Wallah then began to mature, but he wanted a role for me.  Where was I going to come in with this new story?  So then Ruth was prevailed upon to write this movie star role for me.\n\nQ:  Who asked Ruth?\n\nJaffrey:  Jim had already gone.  You see, The Householder happened before.  All this was going on, but somehow The Householder happened before.  He met Ruth, who did the screenplay for it, and they met the Kendals and they met Shashi and Jennifer.  So now they knew this group and had a diary, so they decided they would use part of that diary and make another film, because they really were cutting out also Saeed and using these people that they’d met, whom they liked a lot, and who had a story already written, sort of.\nBut how would I get into it?  So they persuaded Ruth, and Ruth would not budge.  She said, “No, she can’t play a movie star.”  When she knew me, I was very—I still am—I was thin, wore glasses, and in her mind—\n\nQ:  You weren’t blonde.  [laughs]\n\nJaffrey:  Not at all a buxom movie star.  So Ruth kept saying, “No way.  No way.  She’s not.  Jim, you don’t understand.”\nAnd Jim kept saying, “You don’t know what she looks like now.  Just see her.”\nSo anyway, with great reluctance, Ruth wrote—you have to ask her about this—this role for me, and I have to say that she was fine when we met.\n\nQ:  This was in what country?\n\nJaffrey:  In Delhi, when I went to Delhi for the shooting.  She was fine, but when I drove up to Kasauli, my first shots were in Kasauli, and I was driving up, throwing up along the way, and arrived.  All the crew looked at me and said, “She is going to play a movie star?”  [laughter]  I said, “Oh, god, again.”\n\nQ:  You were pregnant?\n\nJaffrey:  No, I wasn’t pregnant.\n\nQ:  Just throwing up.\n\nJaffrey:  I was just throwing up because of the curves of the road.  I always throw up when I go to hill station.  I have done that since I was a kid.  But it all worked out.\n\nQ:  Then where were you living?\n\nJaffrey:  When?  When we were shooting?  Then Saeed and I were divorced, and the kids, I think, were with my parents and my sister in India.  I was trying to get a divorce, which I went to Mexico for, and then I came back.  Then we went to do Shakespeare Wallah after I’d got my divorce.\nThen I was in India with my kids, after Shakespeare Wallah, and Jim and Ismail said, “We are taking the film to the Berlin Film Festival, so you must all come.”  And, you know, Ismail always had this big thing, “Come on!  We’re going to a festival!”  So there we were in Berlin, at the Berlin Film Festival for this film.\nWhy was I telling you this?\n\nQ:  Just following where you lived.\n\nJaffrey:  Oh yes.  So at that time my parents had rented a place for me just next to my sister—it was actually attached—in Defense Colony, so I was living with them there at that time.  Then I left and went to the film festival in Berlin, where, of course, things went very well.\nThen they said, “We’re now going to go to the New York Film Festival, Lincoln Center Film Festival.”  So then I came here.  I’d already met Sanford [Allen] before, but nothing major had happened between us, but then we met up again and we decided we wanted to get married.  So then I sent for the kids and they came back.  Then we moved in here in ’67 and we’ve been here since.\n\nQ:  During this time that you were making Shakespeare Wallah and afterward, was anybody cooking?  Was Ismail cooking?  Were you cooking?\n\nJaffrey:  Ismail was cooking too, but whenever they came to my house, I cooked a semi-elaborate Indian meal.  I was cooking.  I was really cooking through that marriage.  I was cooking, learning new things, learning biryanis and pulaos.  I was determined to master everything.\n\nQ:  How did you learn them?\n\nJaffrey:  Getting recipes from my family, mostly, learned that way.  I bought one cookbook, Mrs. Balbir Singh’s cookbook, which was the only one, and it was very complicated, but it was helpful.  It was very helpful to me.  But most of the recipes were coming from home.  I certainly was cooking, and Ismail, always from the earliest days, he cooked something.  He always made a dal, he made a rice, and we got that every time, actually, dal and rice and then shrimp.  He used to make a shrimp with cherry tomatoes.  Then sometimes the dal had slices of lemon in it.  It was always tasty.  It always tasted good.\nVery often you’d go up there and there’d be nothing and he hadn’t shopped.  “Ismail, are you going to cook?”\nHe said, “Wait, wait, wait.  You sit down.”  And then he’d give you a job.  “Can you collate these papers?” or something.  “I’ll be just back.”  And he would start his shopping then and come back very quickly, put everything on, and by the time you finished collating his work or whatever he wanted you to do, there’d be dinner.\n\nQ:  And that was New York.\n\nJaffrey:  That was New York.\n\nQ:  Wow.  That’s really amazing.  At what point did you think you had collected enough recipes that you wanted to put together your own?\n\nJaffrey:  I never felt that way.  That was much later.  Even though we were already 1967, that didn’t happen till ’69.\n\nQ:  And that happened because Judith Jones found you?\n\nJaffrey:  No, no, no.  Judith was much later.  Several things happened.  Ismail, who, as I keep saying, he can sell his little finger if he wanted to, could sell his grandmother if he wanted to, decided he needed publicity for Shakespeare Wallah, and he did everything.  Most human beings don’t do that with his kind of budget.  So he persuaded Craig Claiborne to do a big piece on me as an actress who likes to cook.\n\nQ:  He knew Craig Claiborne?\n\nJaffrey:  He didn’t know anybody.  He just found a way to meet him, which was utterly charming, and found a way to get to meet him.\n\nQ:  What was his goal in terms of doing a piece on you?\n\nJaffrey:  All Ismail wanted was publicity.  That’s all he wanted.  [laughs]  So in many ways Ismail is responsible for starting me off in certain directions.  This was another one, the Craig Claiborne connection.  Craig Claiborne had probably not written anything on Indian food before.\nIt’s a really funny story and I don’t tell it because it’s an awkward story.  Craig Claiborne was going to do this piece.  I was living with Sanford in a one-room apartment on Eleventh Street, and I said, “I can’t have Craig Claiborne come here.”  So a friend of ours across the road had a nicer apartment, so I said to William, “Can I borrow your apartment?  He’s just coming to interview me.”\n\tHe said, “Fine, fine.  Just use the apartment.  Here are the keys.”\n\tSo he and his wife gave me the keys, and Craig Claiborne walks up and he comes in and he’s looking at the kitchen and the bookshelves, seeing the cookbooks on the shelves, and said, “Oh, these are the books you’re interested in.”  Not me.\n\tSo then he talked to me, he interviewed me, and I said, “What can I cook for you?  Shall I make this and that?”\n\tHe said, “Yes, you can make this, but not today.  I’ll come back in a week.”  [laughter]\n\tI said, “Oh, my god.”\n\tSo next week I had to ask them again for their house and again go through the charade.  So he took pictures and he did that particular article.\n\nQ:  What did you make?\n\nJaffrey:  I made stuffed peppers, stuffed with potatoes, which is one of my mother’s really wonderful dishes.  So I made that, and the article came out as a result of that and one other thing.\nSo now I had these three kids and I feel they are my responsibility.  I have to earn enough money to send them to school, and being brought up the way I was, they had to be not just any school, they had to be the best schools.  And how was I going to do this?  So we had put them in the local school here, but I was very unhappy with the local school, so I started writing.  I was writing for the Smithsonian, any paper that wanted—I wrote for The New York Times, I wrote for—gosh, any—\n\nQ:  These were articles on Indian food or what?\n\nJaffrey:  No, they were articles on music, on dance, on drama, sculpture, and buildings.\n\nQ:  Anything you could—\n\nJaffrey:  Anything that I could get.  I was looking up the other day, going through some of them, and I have an article on the method of preserving paintings, the art of preservation of paintings.  Anything, but it was in the world of the arts.\n\tThen there was a magazine called Holiday magazine.  It’s not there anymore.  Pamela Fiori was the secretary.  She’s now the editor of Town & Country.  My editor was Patricia Bosworth.  So my editor then was Patricia Bosworth, and Pamela Fiori was her assistant.  Pamela went on to be the editor of Food & Wine and now is with Town & Country.  Anyway, so she was just a secretary.  I wrote my first piece.  They said, “Do something about India and growing up in India and what food was like.”  So that was my first piece on Indian food.\n\nQ:  For Town & Country?\n\nJaffrey:  No, no, no.  For Holiday magazine.  I did that piece, and I used that in the introduction to my first cookbook, bits of that, and sent it in.  Based on that and that first thing that Craig Claiborne did, I was approached by a freelance editor who said, “Would you be interested?  Nobody’s done an Indian cookbook.  Would you be interested?”  So I started putting, vaguely, recipes together.  But he soon disappeared.\n\nQ:  The idea didn’t scare you?\n\nJaffrey:  No.  In fact, I’ll tell you the story.  So then it didn’t go anywhere, but somebody suggested that they had a friend who worked at another publishing house with a P.  I can’t remember the name.  It’s all escaping me.  Anyway, a big publisher, one of the big ones.  So they took my book and they said, “Send the recipes.”  I was sending them recipes.  They were putting it together.  Then half they sold and somebody else came in and it became another company.  My editor was fired.  I ended up with another editor, Virginia Kelly, I remember, and she was very excited about the book, but then the whole company disbanded, and that publication house went dead.\n\tSo now I have this book which is almost finished.  It is finished, and nowhere to take it.  So I went to my friend Ved Mehta, and Ved said that he knew André Schiffrin, and that I should talk to André Schiffrin.  So I spoke to him, and André said, “Judith Jones in the best person.  Why don’t you send it to her.  So I will speak to her.”\n\tSo I sent it to Knopf, and Judith took one look at it and bought it.  It was very, very quick. \n\nQ:  This was An Invitation to Indian Cooking.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tJaffrey - 1 -  PAGE 53\n\n\n\nTTT\n\nInterviewee:  Madhur Jaffrey\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #2\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t         Greenwich Village, NY\n\nDate:  December 16, 2010\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is December 16, and I’m with Madhur Jaffrey at her apartment in Greenwich Village for our second interview.\nGood afternoon.\n\nQ:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  Since we’re down here in the Village and I know you knew James Beard, why don’t you tell me about how you met him and what happened after that.\n\nJaffrey:  Well, what happened was that I had written—let me actually start not with James Beard, but with my first book.\n\nQ:  Okay.\n\nJaffrey:  Because in a way, you were asking me about it and it’s all one continuous story.\n\nQ:  That’s good, actually.  We’re back to An invitation to Indian Cooking.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.\n\nQ:  And working with Judith Jones.\n\nJaffrey:  I don’t know if I went into it before.  The way the introduction came about was that I had written an article for The New York Times.  I hadn’t written it.  Sorry.  Craig Claiborne did an article on me.\n\nQ:  Yes, we did talk about that.\n\nJaffrey:  We talked about that.  So as a result of this—I think we talked about it—I was approached by an independent editor.  That came to naught, but then the book went to Harcourt Brace and, at that time, Jovanovich.  It was coming along.  It had been there for a couple of years, and a wonderful young editor there, and then they went through this thing where every half the people or third of the people were fired.  It was one of those times for the publishing industry.\n\nQ:  Just like now.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, yes.  So amongst the people fired was my editor, my young editor.  She handed it over to somebody, but it was not a very good relationship.  Nothing was moving because they were in a very precarious position.  So I decided to take the book away.  I had a friend, Ved Mehta, whom you know, who knew André Schiffrin.  This is the actual story.  I’ve never mentioned these names before when I tell the story, because most people don’t know who they are at all.  I didn’t think it mattered.\n\nQ:  I’m glad to have them, yes.\n\nJaffrey:  So André said, “Let me look at the book.  Send it to me.  I will look at it.  Or better still, I will give it to Judith Jones to look at, at Knopf.”\n\tSo almost overnight, that book, which is now a completed book, you see, because I’d been working on it for so long, went to Judith, and she bought it overnight.\n\nQ:  She must have been very thrilled to have a completed book.\n\nJaffrey:  It was a completed book, and I had written it pretty much the way it appears.  What Judith was very good at was saying things like, “You need more of this.  You need to say what to serve with what.  You need to have menus at the end of the book, because people are not familiar with Indian food.  They don’t know how to serve it.”  So all that came from her, but basically what I sent her was a completed book.\n\tIt’s funny, I was being interviewed by The Hindu the other day, and they said, “How has your style changed from that time to this time?”  And when I look at that book, I could have written it today.  It hasn’t changed, actually, all that much.  I think I understood the logic of recipe-writing instinctively and didn’t need to be taught how to write a recipe, and I always wrote recipes with a certain amount of detail, because I felt it would have helped me had my mother sent me more detailed recipes, and for people cooking for the first time, it’s absolutely essential.\nSo my style of writing cookery books had pretty much evolved, and Judith certainly was most helpful in looking at it from the outsider’s point of view and say, “I would want to know this.  I would want to know that.”\n\nQ:  Things you would need for the American market.\n\nJaffrey:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And those included things like what would you serve with it and all that.  I was already inclined to write stories in there, but she encouraged me to write more personal stories so that each recipe had some connection to human beings rather than just be a pure recipe.\n\tSo now here I am, I’ve got a very tiny advance for this book and it’s ready, and Craig Claiborne has already given it a wonderful review, because he had sort of found me, in a way.\n\nQ:  How did he find you?\n\nJaffrey:  Through Ismail.  You see, Ismail, whom I keep saying could sell anything he wanted, had, needless to say, found Craig Claiborne, and he always knows who the players are and he gets in touch with them and keeps up with him.  That’s his genius, was his genius.  So he knew, “Okay, Craig Claiborne has to be cultivated,” and made friends with him, told him that he must do an article, the way he talked, “You must do an article on Madhur!  She’s a great actress and she loves to cook!”  So he did this article.  I told you the story about the article.\n\nQ:  You told me about Craig Claiborne, yes.  Not James Beard, but Craig Claiborne.\n\nJaffrey:  I had told you the story about that.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJaffrey:  Okay.  So he does this piece.  The book is selling a little bit here, a little bit there.  There are young students at Harvard [University] buying it.  But there’s no great demand for it.  Judith said, “One of the ways we build demand,” she’s very good with all these other aspects of it, “is you should teach.  People should know of you as a teacher.  You should pass on this curiosity, the interest in this new food.”\nSo I said, “All right.”\nShe knew James Beard, so she approached him and said, “Where could she teach?”\nSo Jim, very open, said, “Here in my house.  She can teach in my house.”  He lived on Tenth Street.\nSo I was going to teach there, but we tried advertising in a meager way, but nobody signed up.  I said to Judith, “What are we going to do?”\nShe said, “Don’t worry.  We will get a few people from Knopf, maybe a few people from Gourmet, secretaries, assistants.”\nThen Jim said, “I will be in every class,” and he was.  He was sitting there in every class.  So that’s how I started teaching and got to know James Beard.\nThen he moved to Twelfth Street.  Of course, it was right in my block.  So as he was getting older, he would ask me to come and help.  What he was teaching in those days was basic courses in making pancakes, in making sauces, Hollandaise sauce.  What did I know?  But I had Julia Child.  I had already, without knowing who she was, before she did any television program, had already bought her book, and it was my great introduction to good French cooking.  So I would have to teach classes the next day, and then the night before, I would sit with my Julia Child, and she had great things, like, “If it goes wrong, this is what you do.  If this goes wrong, this is what you do.”  I had really understood all that.  Then I would go teach, and it didn’t seem all that difficult.  So, crepes, pancakes was one course, sauces was another course, and I was teaching all these for Jim.\n\nQ:  As opposed to Indian cooking.\n\nJaffrey:  I was also teaching Indian cooking, but he would ask me to come and help out on these other courses and other things that he was teaching.  If he was ill one day, then I would teach the course.  So it was a wonderful relationship.  He would come to our home for lunch and we would sit and talk or we would go over to his house and often Marion Cunningham was around.  I had never had polenta before, and she made a polenta with tomato sauce that I thought was the best thing in the world I’d ever had.  [laughs]  So the four of us, Sanford and I and Marion and Jim, would sit and have a meal together, whoever was in town.  So we became great friends.  The fact that I was an actress intrigued him because he was a singer.\n\nQ:  Of course.  He had wanted to perform, yes.\n\nJaffrey:  He said, “You know, we are very similar.  We are hucksters.”  [laughs]  That’s what he used to say to me.  I thought, “Hmm, maybe I am.”  But he saw a common kind of spirit in me, so that’s how I got to know him.  Of course, over the years we got to know each other better and better.\n\nQ:  Did you stay in touch with him after you stopped teaching there?\n\nJaffrey:  Oh, absolutely.  I was living here, but he was around the corner, and you couldn’t pass his house, his manservant, Clay [Triplette], would be looking out of the window.  He’d say, “Hi!  Come on in.”\n\tThen when Jim got ill, we did go to see him when he was ill.  I think this was like a week before he died.  We were going to see him, and I called him up.  I said everybody must be bringing him things, so I should call him and ask him what he’d like.  And I called him up.  We were in the taxi and I jumped out and I called him from a pay phone, and I said, “What can we bring you?”\nAnd he said, “Some strawberries would be nice.”\nSo we looked for some strawberries.  We took that to his room.  There people were almost having a party there.  And he said, “Open that drawer.”  Opened that drawer.  Nuts.  Opened the next drawer, wine bottles, you know, in the hospital.  So we stayed with him for like an hour, and everybody had a drink and ate something.  Then somebody else must have called, because I heard him say, “Some asparagus would be nice.”  [laughter]  So he loved his food till the end, and we stayed good friends all the time.\n\nQ:  Those are nice memories.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, very nice memories.\n\nQ:  Let’s go back to An Invitation to Indian Cooking and the reception of it when it finally was out.\n\nJaffrey:  The marvelous thing for me and, in retrospect, even more marvelous is that young people in colleges began to buy this book, and it was a word-of-mouth thing.  I have had kids—I mean kids, people in their forties—come up to me and say that they were raised by parents who cooked Indian food from my book, and that they were now cooking it for their kids.  So that has been a great source of comfort, and the fact that that book is still in print.\n\nQ:  It’s a wonderful book.\n\nJaffrey:  It warms the cockles of my heart [to have the book still in print].\n\nQ:  You mentioned the other day that your mother sent you some early recipes, and one she sent you—\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  What I was asking you about was, you mentioned that one of the recipes involved whole spices, and so you thought that was easier.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  It’s also because I liked it very much.\n\nQ:  Is that in the book?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, it is.\n\nQ:  Which one is that?\n\nJaffrey:  I’ll have to get it.\n\nQ:  Okay.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  Judith was always present at every photography session.  I remember this cover being done, and Judith was there.  She was there when the photography was being done for my last book.  She’s very present in—\n\nQ:  How many of your books has she edited?\n\nJaffrey:  Now four, the first two and the last two.\nThese are my mother’s letters, which were—\n\nQ:  I’ve always wondered what they were.  I see.\n\nJaffrey:  They’re in Hindi, and there [are] recipes in there.  I was living in London, and obviously it was the time of that war where Israel was involved, England was involved.  It was the Suez Canal.  I remember, because I wanted to write and tell them the British reaction, so I scribbled “Suez” over here, “single room.”  Obviously when I wrote home, I was going to tell them about living in a single room and about the Suez, the reactions to the Suez war in England.  So it gives the time of these letters.\n\tSo the recipe was—this is falling apart.  Lamb with whole spices—here.  [Jaffrey is looking at a copy of the book]. This is it.  It’s the first recipe in the “meats” chapter, this one.\n\nQ:  Are any of the other recipes that she sent you in the beginning in the book?\n\nJaffrey:  They’re all there.\n\nQ:  They’re all in the book.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So there was a potato one.\n\nJaffrey:  One was [potatoes with asafetida and cumin], yes, which must be in the book, because I started cooking with that one.  See, even here I’ve done all my vegetables alphabetically, always organized in my mind so people should be able to find things in a cookbook.  This was one of the early ones, stuffed whole pea pods with cumin, because I love those.  Potatoes with asafetida and cumin, this one is the first one I ever cooked, and this is what I ate with the pumpernickel bread.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, the girls were how old at that point?\n\nJaffrey:  This is 1973, so the girls were ’59, ’60, ’62, so they were like eleven, twelve, thirteen or less.  Sorry.  Eleven, twelve, and down, going down to nine. \n\nQ:  The reason I ask was I see that you did Autobiography of a Princess in 1974.\n\nJaffrey:  Right.\n\nQ:  But I didn’t find a book between ’73 and ’81 with The World of Eastern Vegetarian, so basically I wondered were you very tied up either with the kids or with articles.\n\nJaffrey:  With the kids and I was doing articles and I was touring.  You have that [printout] thing?  I was touring with a touring company, doing like pretty much what I’m doing now, which is talks, lectures.  I was doing a lecture on tea.  I was doing a lecture, readings of poetry from India, from ancient and modern India, but I had worked it out as a sort of seven stages in a woman’s life, pretty much that way, but using poetry from Asia, from all over Asia to do that.  So I was doing that.\n\nQ:  Where was that?\n\nJaffrey:  Everywhere.  I was getting very good fees.  It was an agency that called me up.  They must have heard me on the radio.  They said, “Would you like to speak, go on a speaking tour?”\n\tI said, “Speak about what?”\n\tAnd they said, “Anything you want.  Obviously you can talk.”  So, based on that, they sent me around.  They called it A Thousand and One Nights, you know, what else, and I probably have a brochure of that somewhere if you want to see it.  I went around on tour and I earned my money through writing articles and doing the speaking tour.\n\nQ:  Let’s talk about Autobiography of a Princess.\n\nJaffrey:  It took me five years to write the vegetarian book, so it took a while.\n\nQ:  How would you like to do this?  Would you like to stay chronologically or talk about your performing work in one chunk and the food work in one chunk?\n\nJaffrey:  I think so, because I don’t have the chronology straight in my head.\n\nQ:  Tell me about Autobiography of a Princess.\n\nJaffrey:  That came about, Jim and Ruth and Ismail were working on it over a long period, because every year they would say, “Oh, we’re going to do it, and we’ve signed Laurence Olivier.”\n\tAnd I said, “Oooh, great, great, great!”\n\tAnd, “Oh, we’re going to do it this year and we’ve signed Gielgud.”  And it wouldn’t happen.\n\tSo the script had been written much before.  Ruth had written it, and they’d given it to me, but I wouldn’t learn it because I thought, “It’s not going to happen.”  Then when they said it’s James Mason, first of all, I hate to tell you this, but I was disappointed.  I thought, after Olivier and Gielgud, James Mason?  Okay.  They said, “We’re going tomorrow,” and I hadn’t learned the lines.  It was just awful, because it just happened like that.\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, where were they?  You were here.\n\nJaffrey:  We were all here, but going traveling to different places to do different things.  All of us were traveling around, but basically Ismail was here, Jim was here, and we were all here.  They had gone to India and they’d gotten the footage from the maharajahs, and that’s what started it, from the palaces.  They found these little bits of footage, real documentary footage.\n\nQ:  That’s what inspired—\n\nJaffrey:  That’s what inspired Ruth to write what she did, and it was based on the footage, really.\n\nQ:  How did they find the footage?\n\nJaffrey:  They just went around.  Jim, as you know, was very interested in art, major paintings, things like that.  So he loved to travel through India, looking at palaces, and this is what they discovered as part of their interest as well, to see what was available, and there were all these bits of film.\n\nQ:  They were film.  I see.  So that’s what made them think, “We can go farther with this”?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, get it all together, old footage of old films that maharajahs had taken.\n\nQ:  So when Ismail said, “We’re going tomorrow,” where did he mean?\n\nJaffrey:  London.  The screenplay was set in London, so it was to be shot in London.  Suddenly we were there, and I remember the first day of shooting.  I was still struggling because I’d been in a plane, learning, learning, learning my lines, and James Mason came in and he knew his lines.  I’d checked up on him with people who’d worked with him or thought they knew him a little bit, and he seemed to be a monster, an egotistical monster in Hollywood, and yet he was absolutely wonderful with me, absolutely wonderful.  I mean, he would sit—you know when you do your close-up, the other actors usually vanish, but he fed me my lines, he sat on a low stool and fed me my lines.  I would see him walking around the set, saying his lines.  If he had to take off a hat and put it somewhere, take off his scarf and put it somewhere, and he would be practicing like I would, and I thought that was interesting to see.  He was doing this kind of miming with the props, as any actor would, to work out how you would do it.  So it was very interesting shooting with him, and very, very wonderful shooting with him.\n\tThe other interesting thing about Autobiography was that Ismail, in his usual way, had gone up to Garrard’s of London, the big jewelry shop, and said, “We’re shooting this film and we need the best jewels for this princess.”  So he had maneuvered it in some way so I had this necklace, the most expensive diamonds and emeralds, necklace, earrings, bracelet, and every day the equivalent of their Brink’s truck would come with everything, taking a different route every day, and then they would put it on me and tape it to my neck.  One man would follow me to the bathroom, to the this, to the that.  I couldn’t go anywhere.  At the end of the day, they would pull the Scotch tape off and all my little hair would sort of come off with it.\n\tOne day while we were shooting, there was a blackout.  Maybe they plugged in too many things.  I don’t know what happened.  And everybody was on me, protecting the jewels.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  I see.  Not you.\n\nJaffrey:  Not me.  They didn’t give two hoots about me.  They were protecting the jewelry.  So that’s a typical Ismail thing, you know.  It happens with every film, especially if you’re playing royalty, and I’ve done quite a bit of that for him, like Begum in Heat and Dust.  Again, he managed to lull the people their fears of never letting out their jewelry and collecting it and bringing it.  Ismail had that way.  He did that in Cotton Mary.  He got all the furniture from various people who never gave out their furniture.  He managed to get it from them.\n\nQ:  He was very charming.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, yes.\n\nQ:  How long did it take?\n\nJaffrey:  Actual shooting, four days.\n\nQ:  So you were away from home for how long?\n\nJaffrey:  Not more than ten days.  But it was shot in sequence.  Because it’s a one-hour film, it was shot in sequence and we did the actual shooting in sequence, but we had rehearsals and meetings and things like that on days before.  But the actual shooting was just four days.\n\nQ:  You were thinking of yourself as an actress primarily at that point?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, of course.  Of course.  And the time line, you see, I don’t even have any memory of any food in that time line, though there probably was, because I’m sure the vegetarian cookbook—no, this one had just come out.  Then it came out in England the next year, and then I was working on my vegetarian one and writing all those hundreds of articles that I wrote.\n\nQ:  That were prior to or part of the Eastern Vegetarian book?\n\nJaffrey:  No, no.  They were completely separate.\n\nQ:  Just making money.\n\nJaffrey:  Just making money.\n\nQ:  Speaking of making money, the Merchant Ivory company, one thing it’s not known for is making money.  [laughs]\n\nJaffrey:  I have never made any money on their films.\n\nQ:  So this film was professional and a labor of love.\n\nJaffrey:  All of them, till the bitter end, until Cotton Mary.  I never made any money on any film, and the only film I made money on was Cotton Mary.\n\nQ:  And why was that?\n\nJaffrey:  Only because Ismail was horribly, horribly guilty, because I had brought the script to him and I had wanted to direct it, and there was a—well, we won’t go into that one.  But I didn’t, in the end, and I think he just felt very bad about it.\n\nQ:  So you came back here to New York, and did you try to get other acting work or were you primarily—\n\nJaffrey:  Always, always.  If you look at my acting bio, it might tell you what I was doing in those years.  I can’t remember, actually.\n\nQ:  But that was your primary identification?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, to myself, certainly.  Is there anything in that period?\n\nQ:  I’m sure there is.  Let’s see.  The Guru was before that.\n\nJaffrey:  That was ’67, yes.\n\nQ:  The Guide, Conduct Unbecoming.\n\nJaffrey:  Those were on Broadway, both of them.\n\nQ:  They were in the late sixties, early seventies?\n\nJaffrey:  Is there no date there?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nJaffrey:  I don’t even remember.  I think this was around—yes.\n\nQ:  It says before Autobiography of a Princess and then it skips to Heat and Dust, but you must have done things between ’74 and ’82.\n\nJaffrey:  Must have, but can’t remember them.\n\nQ:  Nevertheless, your primary identification was—\n\nJaffrey:  For me, it was as a working actress, but England was the big deal, you see.  England changed that.\n\nQ:  Tell me about that.\n\nJaffrey:  Because that’s ’82, so I don’t know if we’re jumping ahead or not.\n\nQ:  That’s all right.\n\nJaffrey:  What happened in ’82 was that I was teaching at home, in my little kitchen, four people at a time, and the BBC was looking to do an educational—so we’re talking maybe 1980, 1979, something like that.  They were looking to do an educational program on Indian cooking, hoping, I think, to present the culture of the community, people would [learn] more about [the South Asian] community.\n\nQ:  Yes, this describes it as an eight-part Indian cooking—maybe it’s a different thing—series plus a cookbook to go with it.\n\nJaffrey:  Right.  That’s it.  But we started working on it, obviously, even though ’82 may be the date it was shown, it took a good year or more, two years, to put it all together.  So I must have started working on it ’80, probably, ’79, ’80.\n\nQ:  If your daughters were asked what their parents did, how did they describe what you do?  Do you have any idea?\n\nJaffrey:  I have no idea.  [laughs]  Probably that I’m an actress.\n\nQ:  Sanford’s easy.  [laughs]\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  I’m sure they said, “She’s an actress,” because this was all rather vague and undefinable, I think.\n\nQ:  Do you have any sense of when you began to think that this cooking thing could be—\n\nJaffrey:  After.  After the BBC, because it was a huge hit.\n\nQ:  Yes, it says it was repeated at least five times.\n\nJaffrey:  The numbers of books I sold and the money I made, you know, because television books sell.  If you have a show on television, you sell books.  This is the unfortunate irony of book sales.  So it was sudden.  I mean, that book has sold over a million copies.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nJaffrey:  So it just sold and sold and sold, and is still selling, that book, the first one.  All of them, I mean, they all did well, but this one is still in print.\n\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  So we’ll go back to Judith and how she reacted to the idea of your doing a—\n\nJaffrey:  Judith didn’t want me to do a vegetarian cookbook then because she already had an author.  What was her name?  Can’t remember.  She had done two books, first one had been very successful and she had done another, and I thought I was the rightful person who should be doing it because I knew Eastern food and Western food, and I would be the ideal person to do it, but because it had already been done, and successfully done, Judith did not want me to do it, and that upset me.  That really upset me, because I thought I was a great candidate to do this book.  And I did eventually do it, not with Judith.\n\nQ:  Did you have a contract for the Eastern Vegetarian?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  I got more money than I did for this book, Invitation, but really nothing.  This was really minimum payments in terms of royalties.  But that book, too, is still in print, the Asian Vegetarian.\n\nQ:  And you had to travel a great deal for those recipes?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, yes, but I enjoyed that.  That’s the part of it I really enjoyed, looking for the recipes, looking for the culture of the areas, seeing what recipes develop in one area and how they differ from another area, and what are the slight differences and why they are there.\n\nQ:  Where did you go besides South India?\n\nJaffrey:  I was writing articles for Gourmet and traveling for them, and I was picking where I wanted to go.  I would ask them, “Do you want an article on Thailand?  Do you want an article on the Philippines?  Do you want one on Japan or Hong Kong?”  And I was doing all these articles, but it was also for myself, really.  I wanted to see these places.  I wanted to understand their food.  Indonesia was another one.  Goa in India, just different parts of India, different parts of the Far East, and even I did another one—I think it was for Gourmet—on the history of Delhi food, because, again, it gave me an excuse to study what had happened with the food, at least from the Muslim period, starting tenth century at least from there onwards.\n\nQ:  Did you take your girls with you when you would go back and do these things?\n\nJaffrey:  Sometimes, yes, but I’ve never taken anybody with me on long trips.  I usually go alone to most places, because I work with such concentration.  I’ve kept every notebook.  So what I do is I travel with a little notebook in my bag and I write in pencil, or it could be a pen, in the little notebook.  Then I come back to the hotel or wherever I am staying.  And because I scribble in the car and I can’t read it half the time, so if you don’t fair it out, as it were, that night, as you probably know, it’s gibberish three days from then.  So I used to fair out and fill in the thoughts.  So I have these two books from every place I’ve been, a rough one and a fair one, and I’ve got them.  I just never throw anything away, so the books are there.\n\tThen I would write recipes in detail.  Like if somebody’s cooking—and I always wanted to see them cook.  I didn’t want them to hand me a recipe, because nobody knows really how to write proper recipes.  They leave things out, and you can’t tell if the heat is high or low, or what kind of pot it is, what is the ideal pot.  So I like to watch them and write all these details down.  They would just do this with salt, you know, just put it in their hand and throw it in.  But eventually I began to have an idea of how much that was, you know, it’s like roughly a tablespoon, roughly a teaspoon.  I would write that “rough teaspoon,” rough this.\n\tThen I would come home, back to America.  I have never had help.  I did it all myself.  So I would do the shopping, I would do the cooking, the writing down in pencil in the kitchen.  Then I would take it to my computer and write out the recipe in the computer, clean it up, write a headnote of some sort to the recipe.  So it was a lot of work for one person, but I never delegated.  I couldn’t trust somebody to do it as well as I could, because I thought they’re bound to leave something out, they’re not going to be as comprehensive as I am.  Every cookbook has errors of various sorts.  It’s like mistype “teaspoon” for “tablespoon,” that happens, or you leave an ingredient out.  But basically, the cookbooks are as good as my writing can be and as complete as I can make them.  It’s really all my doing.  So if it’s flawed, it’s my flaw, pretty much.\n\nQ:  So in that process, your sense of yourself as a culinary writer must have changed, developed?\n\nJaffrey:  Not really.  I mean, I think I was doing that from the beginning.  I was just being ultra, ultra careful.\n\nQ:  But what I mean is in terms of this as a professional activity.\n\nJaffrey:  I never looked at it as such, but in retrospect, I think I became surer, but not necessarily better.  I think I’m just as good in the last book as I am in the first book, so I don’t think I improved markedly, but I have become surer.  That’s all I can really say.\n\nQ:  I was really more asking about your sense of self.\n\nJaffrey:  More confident.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, probably.\n\nQ:  But you were still acting when you could?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, I would drop everything.  The only time I couldn’t—and it was a big, big, I think, career changer for me—there was a film called Lean on Me with Morgan Freeman that I was asked to be in.  It was a small part and they said, “We’ll make it a big part if you come and do it, and it will be a month of shooting.”  It was the same time that I had agreed to do the first BBC program, so then it was a dreadful, dreadful choice to do a BBC series in which I was knowingly going to make so much money, and the film, where it seemed I’d done something.  But here was a book, and I knew how well I did in books.  So in the end, I had to turn it down, and my career could have taken a different turn had I done it, because that was one of the first films for Morgan Freeman.  It didn’t happen, though.\n\nQ:  You mean a more American turn?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, yes, yes.\n\nQ:  How did Heat and Dust come about?\n\nJaffrey:  Again, it’s Jim and Ismail.  I think they were ready to give somebody else the part, and I said, no, I wanted it.  Jim said—I remember his words very well—“How can I ask you to play Shashi’s mother when you played his mistress?  It would be very ungallant of me,” Jim said.\n\tI said, “I don’t care.  I want to do it.”  It was a small part, but I just wanted to do it.  It just seemed like such an interesting film.\n\nQ:  Where was it filmed?\n\nJaffrey:  In Hyderabad, so it was great.  So then I was exploring the foods of Hyderabad, so terrific.\n\nQ:  What I have is in the next couple of years you started exploring children’s books as well.\n\nJaffrey:  Right.  I have a need to do something, and empty spaces make me feel I’m useless, so I always fill them up with something.  My husband always says, “You take on too much,” and it’s true, but if I don’t, I’m sitting there, even if there’s nothing to do for two days, I say there’s nothing, I have no work, a desperate feeling.\n\tSo what were you asking me about, actually?\n\nQ:  How the children’s books—\n\nJaffrey:  So then I had this idea that I never sat down and told my children stories.  I would read them from Indian history, you know, tales of Akbar and Shah Jahan and how they tossed people off the ramparts, you know, and stories like that, more than children’s stories.  I said there’s so many tales that I grew up with, that my aunts and my cousins and older cousins and my grandmother and all told us, and somebody should write them down, because my aunts were all getting older.  There was such a wonderful style of storytelling in the family.  So I started taping my old eighty-year-old aunts and taking their stories down.  I didn’t know when they’d die off, and they did very soon afterwards, but I did tape them all.\nI had these stories now, in Hindi, of course, so I rewrote them for American kids, and that’s how the first book started.  Then there was another one of stories that my father used to tell us, so that became the second one.  Then the third one was somebody approached me and said, “Would you do a book about markets around the world with little simple recipes for children?”  Markets around the world and simple recipes.  So that was the third one.\n\nQ:  So these were different publishers.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, different publishers.  I tried selling the idea for the children’s book, the first one, Seasons of Splendour: [Tales, Myths, and Legends of India], much earlier, but it was sent around and everybody turned it down, everybody in this country.\nSo now that I was very successful in England, so a publisher asked me, “We would love you to do children’s books for Pavilion.”\n\tI said, “I just happen to have something.  I have to find it.  I wrote it a while ago.”  And they bought it immediately.\n\nQ:  It seems like around the same time, what I have written down here is the Assam Garden film.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, that was an English one.\n\nQ:  And then doing Medea in London.\n\nJaffrey:  Same director, yes.\n\nQ:  At BBC.  So it looks like in 1986-87 you were very busy performing.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Was that all in London?  How did these come about?\n\nJaffrey:  Assam Garden was a very interesting story.  There was apparently a very little piece in one of the English papers about a garden that had been discovered in Devonshire, I think.  An English Surgeon General posted in India had come back from India with a lot of plants and he had set up this garden in the nineteenth century.  The garden was now still there.  He’s gone, but the garden was still there, was overgrown, etc., etc.  So the idea, the germ of the story came from that, and the writer wrote a story based on this little germ of an idea.\nThen they were looking for a place to film it.  As happens, you send out these people who scout—location hunting based on the script.  So the film-makers were taken to all kinds of locations, and by complete chance, they were taken to this place, the actual place where it had happened.  I think it was on the river.  It may have been in Wales technically or not, I can’t remember, but it was sort of north of Bristol somewhere.  So we shot there.  We shot in that area, near the Severn River.  It was near the Severn River.  It was a beautiful.  The garden had to be cleaned up.  It was vastly overgrown.  We shot in that garden.\n\nQ:  These conversations, when you were having them with these people, you were here, is that right, in New York, and then would return to England?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  I lived here.  Every time I had to get a visa, had to get a labor permit, etc., etc., to work in England.\n\nQ:  Was that complicated?\n\nJaffrey:  It was complicated, very complicated, but they did it for me every time.  They helped me get it, whatever was needed.\n\nQ:  Is that like the Actors Equity rule here?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  You have to get permission to work there.\n\nQ:  What about Medea?\n\nJaffrey:  The director of Assam Garden, we got very friendly and began talking, and she said, “What would you like to do?”\n\tI said, “Well, a classical play, maybe Medea or something.”\n\tShe said, “Let’s do it.”  So she got the ball going and she directed it, so that’s how that happened.\n\nQ:  This says Love Match on the BBC.\n\nJaffrey:  A television film.\n\nQ:  And Perfect Murder.\n\nJaffrey:  A film.\n\nQ:  In Britain?\n\nJaffrey:  No, Perfect Murder was not.  Perfect Murder was sort of an Merchant Ivory film, but not really, because I think Ismail—no, Ismail didn’t direct, but they gave it to Zafar Hai, director.  So they gave the script to him and he directed it, but it was a Merchant Ivory production.  They were in charge.  So that’s how I was in it and so was my daughter.\n\nQ:  Did you feel a continuing part of the Merchant Ivory—\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you talk about that.\n\nJaffrey:  Merchant Ivory became like a family.  Whenever they had a party, they would collect all the people that had worked with them, so we all got to know each other, you know.  We would see each other at these gatherings, Merchant Ivory gatherings, so if you were Christopher Reeve or you were Emma Thompson or Helen Bonham Carter, we all met all the time, so we feel as if we know each other, but we don’t know each other that well.  Some of us do, but not all of us.  But we did know each other as being part of this family, this Merchant Ivory constellation or whatever it is, and we kept meeting at all kinds of functions.\nOf course, a lot of us were there when Ismail died, too.  So we were together in England whenever there was a party in England, all the English side of us would be there, and if there was a party here, there would be some of the English side and some of the Indian side and some from the American side.  The opening, everybody would go everywhere to these things.  So it remained and then actively used again and again, so we would see each other very often at work as well.\n\nQ:  This says that Madhur Jaffrey’s Cookbook was 1988, so at some point you started working on that, and then it says “a three-year project for the BBC, Madhur Jaffrey’s Far Eastern Cookery.”\n\nJaffrey:  That was a huge project.\n\nQ:  So you were balancing a lot.\n\nJaffrey:  Right.\n\nQ:  I understand why you kept all your notebooks.  [laughter]\n\nJaffrey:  I just don’t like throwing anything away, so they just stayed there.  I have to decide what to do with them.  I have to give them to somebody.\n\nQ:  Did you feel any conflict—conflict is perhaps not the right word.  Was it at all hard to balance doing so many things at the same time?\n\nJaffrey:  No.  You get up in the day and you do whatever you do in the day, and sometimes it was this and sometimes it was that.  It’s like looking after kids, cooking.  Women are used to juggling twenty things.\n\nQ:  When you had to leave New York, Sanford was here?\n\nJaffrey:  Sanford was here, yes.  Eventually the kids were old enough, eventually, but originally, when they were little, Sanford was here.  For the speaking engagements, it would be like one-night things and back, you know, so I tried managing it, traveling very little when they were little, and then increasing it as they got older and older.\n\nQ:  You continued to work with the BBC, and this one mentions both Far Eastern Cookery—\n\nJaffrey:  That was a lovely series that they did, very wonderful series in eight countries on the Far East: Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, Hong Kong, Philippines.  Gosh, I can’t even remember them all.  Have I covered everything?  Anyway, there were eight, and it was so much for them that they divided it between two directors and each went back and forth.  It was a year’s worth of shooting, but I had to stay on for most of it because I was the constant.\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, you were collecting recipes from a wider world perspective, from the Far East, that I guess you were eventually able to put to use.\n\nJaffrey:  And the book that went with the series, it’s always bigger than what you show.\n\nQ:  There’s another series, BBC Radio 4, “six-part series on the history of food from manual to microwave.”\n\nJaffrey:  That was great.\n\nQ:  What was that?\n\nJaffrey:  That was wonderful.  That was a radio series.  The English get very serious on radio.  It was food and medicine, food and industry, food and—I can’t even remember all the parts of it.  Food and industry, food and health, medicine, food and war, the Army marches on its stomach, and then just looking around the world and seeing what actually happened.  It was very, very interesting.\n\tI know about food and medicine in India and China and Far East.  We went to France for various things.  We were looking at the start of the wine industry using the Irish—like the Wild Geese and all these people coming from Ireland to start wineries in France, and we were looking at all that.  I was asking people about the medicinal part of it and what they considered medicine in France.  This doctor told us this wonderful story which we used, because we interviewed a lot of people, and he said for bedwetting, the best cure—and you have to hear this with a French accent; I can’t do it so well—the best cure for bedwetting is to eat a mouse.  So if a child wet his bed, they were forced to eat a mouse.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nJaffrey:  And that stopped them bedwetting, the fear.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Good lord.\n\nJaffrey:  So we interviewed people like [Simon] Schama, and the guy who wrote the book on sugar.  What’s his name?  John Hopkins.  Sidney Mintz.  We interviewed very interesting people.  I think he was in food and industry.  It’s such a fascinating book on how sugar changed the world, apart from the slaves, all the way to the industry, how it was introduced into England and how the English were made to drink tea with sugar, high tea, and how it all came about.  Tate & Lyle, their money comes from sugar, Tate.\n\nQ:  Sugar was not a natural thing to have with tea?\n\nJaffrey:  They had no tea.\n\nQ:  I meant in India.  Certainly not in China yet.\n\nJaffrey:  No.  We didn’t drink tea in the same way in India at all, to begin with.  We learned the British way from the British, and they deliberately introduced it, because it was being drunk like this, China tea, as they called it, in handleless little cups and small amounts, without any milk or sugar or anything in it.  Then the British had to sell sugar to the English, to begin with, and they sold rum, that was one form which they even sold to the people who were growing the sugar, and the other was the barons, sugar barons like Tate, the museum guy, their family, Tate & Lyle, same thing, same family.\n\nQ:  For heaven sakes.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  Same family.  So they are the ones who gave rations of sugar to factory workers, so then they began—\n\nQ:  To get them hooked?\n\nJaffrey:  To get them hooked on sugar.\n\nQ:  Oh, my goodness.\n\nJaffrey:  You should read that book, Sidney Mintz’s book on sugar.  So then people started drinking milk and having bread and butter and jam, and that became supper for the English factory worker.  He came home, he had his cup of tea with milk and sugar, lots of sugar, with very simple bread and butter, whatever else he could have, and that became supper or dinner.\n\nQ:  That’s fascinating.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.\n\nQ:  By 1991, you were among ten people honored by New York Magazine who have changed the way New York eats.  That’s a very big deal.  Did it seem that way to you?\n\nJaffrey:  That’s when the honors start, in the nineties.\n\nQ:  Your honors.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, because I’m getting older, I suppose.  [laughter]  Somebody went, “Oh, god, we’d better do something about her.”  I have a similar one from Governor Pataki.  Sanford says that all the blacks are picked up and honored in history in February.  Well, there’s a History Month, which is around the same time, Women’s History Month or something like that.  So whatever woman they can find that’s not white, they say, “Okay, let’s look around for the old ones.”  So I got honored by Pataki.  So it just started then, because they’re always looking for, “What have we not got this time?”  So that started.\n\nQ:  Did you continue to teach here?\n\nJaffrey:  I stopped teaching in the nineties, probably.  It was just too much.  I was working, doing too many things, and as I said, I was doing it all by myself, setting up the classes, typing out all the recipes to be used in the classes, and I wasn’t making all that much money, you know.  It was just not a worthwhile deal.  So I thought, I can teach on television.  It’s much easier.  I can teach with my books, and the return is better, and I have peace and quiet in the home, because the children would come in, sneak in if a class was going on.  Sanford would sneak in.  [laughs]  It was just difficult.\n\nQ:  You must have been very comfortable on television.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  I still am.  I’m comfortable.  I mean, that’s my background, so I’m comfortable on a stage of any sort, except when acting.  Then all the terrors come back.  But if I’m just talking, I can talk.\n\nQ:  Are there still terrors?\n\nJaffrey:  Every actor has terrors, yes.  Opening-night terrors.  “Will I forget the lines?” terrors on the stage, all that.\n\nQ:  I guess it has to do with being appreciated or liked or applauded?\n\nJaffrey:  No, it’s just the fright of being alone and you’re carrying something, yet I have no fright when I talk, because my life is not hanging by a thread.  But on the stage, it is.\n\nQ:  Do you have agents for both your writing and for your theatrical work?\n\nJaffrey:  In England and here, yes.\n\nQ:  When did that start?\n\nJaffrey:  Fairly early.  I’ve had literary agents and acting agents probably from the sixties, seventies, both there and here.\n\nQ:  I guess the act of having these agents must have made each one of those activities seem quite professional.  I mean, they were quite professional, but—\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, and made it easier, because I didn’t have to deal with the legal aspect of anything.\n\nQ:  A Taste of the Far East, the Clarkson Potter 1993 book, those recipes, did they come out, in part, of your going around to—\n\nJaffrey:  No.  Taste of the Far East, I think it was started by Pavilion in England, the other ones who started it, and Clarkson Potter, whoever bought it here, just bought the book, but it was an English book to begin with, a Pavilion book.\n\nQ:  But nevertheless, it looks like that’s the one that won two James Beard Awards.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  It’s a beautiful book.\n\nQ:  One Cookbook of the Year was the other, I guess, Asian or something like that?\n\nJaffrey:  I can’t remember.  It’s probably there.  If it’s my book, it will be there.\n\nQ:  What was Two Rooms?\n\nJaffrey:  It was a wonderful play by Lee Blessing.  I was so happy to get the part, because I wasn’t playing an Indian; I was just a State Department official.\n\nQ:  Your father must have been pleased about that.  [laughter]\n\nJaffrey:  Yes.  I got it some way or the other.  But he was dead by that time.\n\nQ:  I see.\n\nJaffrey:  That was at the Signature Theatre, which I loved doing.  I was so happy with that.\n\nQ:  So it was at the Signature Theatre in sort of the same way the Signature Theatre functions now?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, same people.  Same people.  And I just auditioned for it, just went in for an audition.\n\nQ:  There are an awful lot of books after this, Quick and Easy Indian Cookery, An Indian Spice Kitchen, another children’s book, Market Days.\n\nJaffrey:  That’s that one I mentioned to you.\n\nQ:  Madhur Jaffrey’s Flavors of India.  How did you come up with new ideas for focuses for cookbooks?\n\nJaffrey:  I just think about it, and if it interests me in some way, then if it requires research or thought, and if I’m not repeating myself in some way, I will do it.  I need to challenge myself.  I can’t just do the same thing.  People would say to me, “Why don’t you just put some of this and some of that together?”  People do books like that.  I say, “I can’t do that.  You can do it,” and they’ve done it.  That’s why they say I have thirty books.  I don’t.  Because [publishers have often put bits of my books together to create a ‘new’ book.] When you say I have fifteen and sixteen books, they’re all books that I wanted to do, and they tell a particular aspect of food.  They reveal something that has not been revealed before, hopefully. \n\nQ:  The launch of a line of sauces and chutneys, that was different.\n\nJaffrey:  Purely monetary decision.  Purely monetary.  I was approached, offered a lot of money in England, and asked if I would do it, and I said yes.\n\nQ:  What was it?\n\nJaffrey:  It was literally a line of sauces by a company that, until then, just sold—it was a huge, rich company selling rice, Indian rice and teas in England and the world.  Big name.  So they had approached me, and I said yes.  It would be exciting to work with the developers, try and make it as natural to real Indian food as possible.  And even though I knew that there would have to be preservatives in it of some sort if it was going to last a year on the shelf, I thought I would do it because I needed the money.  It was a clear commercial decision on my part.  I’m not a purist in that sense.  I like pure things, but if there’s a way of making money that I can justify in some way, I will do it.\n\nQ:  Had Sanford been working for the symphony a very long time?\n\nJaffrey:  He did.  He worked for fifteen years.  Then he left.  He left in the eighties.\n\nQ:  Because around that time, musicians didn’t make a great deal of money.\n\nJaffrey:  No, no.  I mean, I had to work.  This is the thing.  I had kids in colleges, you know.  I had to work.  There was no question that I needed to work and I needed to make money.\n\nQ:  Your honors were a lot to you.  You must have felt quite good about that part of things.\n\nJaffrey:  I did.  They were rewards.  They were wonderful rewards.\n\nQ:  Was your mother still alive?\n\nJaffrey:  No.\n\nQ:  What does your family think of what you do?\n\nJaffrey:  They ignore it.  My family, as it exists, this kind of success means very little to them.  When I talk to my sister in India, she doesn’t create anything, you know but I think she is a step ahead of me in the development of her soul.  [laughs]  My family doesn’t understand [my need to keep pushing].  They say, “Why are you exhausting yourself running around like this?”  I can’t explain, but I am a different person.\n\nQ:  The Silver Spoon Award [in Food Arts magazine], to me, is a big deal because of what that represents.\n\nJaffrey:  That’s Michael Batterberry and it’s our own people, you know.\n\nQ:  Yes.  I’m trying to think how to describe it for these purposes.  They are people of considerable achievement one way or another, that Food Arts feels they want to designate with a Silver Spoon.\n\nJaffrey:  Right.\n\nQ:  I’m noticing a reissue of An Invitation to Indian Cooking in ’99.  Do you know if that was the first time it was redone?\n\nJaffrey:  I can’t remember.  You’d have to check that with Echo Press and Harper.  What’s his name?  First name?  He’s a wonderful guy.  Echo Press is the one that did it.\n\nQ:  It looks like, in the first decade of this century, that you were doing a lot of acting, a lot of writing.  You haven’t slowed down at all.\n\nJaffrey:  I keep saying I will, I will, I will, but I can’t seem to.\n\nQ:  What was Flawless about?\n\nJaffrey:  Flawless, I was so excited by the thought of doing anything with [Robert] De Niro, because he was such a hero of mine, after [Marlon] Brando.  It was a film about a man who had a stroke.  The part that concerned me was that he’s had a stroke and he’s angry and he’s resisting any kind of treatment, and I play his therapist, who helps him with his treatment.  But the interesting thing for me was that I thought, oh, I’m going to get to know De Niro because I have these two wonderful scenes with him and we talk and we chat.  Well, he’s had a stroke and he doesn’t talk and he walks with a limp.  So when we were introduced, he was not talking and he was walking with a limp.  He was in character.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  So, no smalltalk on the set.\n\nJaffrey:  No smalltalk.  Zilch.\n\nQ:  What got you to the Royal Court, Last Dance at Dum-Dum?\n\nJaffrey:  That was this wonderful, wonderful playwright [Ayub Khan-Din] from Pakistani English, born in England.  Did you see his film called East is East?  It was made into a film as well.\n\nQ:  No.\n\nJaffrey:  He grew up in a large family.  I don’t remember how many kids there were, but at least eight or nine, if not ten.  I can’t remember.  And all boys except for perhaps one girl.  I can’t remember now.  But anyway, they were brought up in north England by a very strict Pakistani father, and they all rebelled in their own ways.  So East is East is a comedy done first at the Royal Court in London. It was his first play.\nThen his next play was Last Dance at Dum-Dum, and he came here to see me and sort of offered me the part after we met.  It was about the Anglo-Indian community in Calcutta, sort of the last of the Anglo-Indian community in Calcutta.\n\nQ:  And what did you play?\n\nJaffrey:  I played the lead.  I can’t even remember the name of the woman, but one of the Anglican women.  So we did it in London and then we went on tour all over England with it.  So that was wonderful also for me.\n\nQ:  I have next Chutney Popcorn and, the same year, Cotton Mary.\n\nJaffrey:  Right.  Chutney Popcorn—you must rent and see these films, actually.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nJaffrey:  Chutney Popcorn is the first big film by a young, new Indian American director [Nisha Ganatra], and she’s gay.  The film is about a lesbian relationship, and I’m the mother of two daughters, one straight and one gay.  It’s a comedy and it’s really fun and well done, I think.\n\nQ:  Do you have any feelings about the difference between working on the stage and working in film?\n\nJaffrey:  No, no.  I just think it’s easier to work on film because once you’ve done it, you’ve done it.  You don’t have to keep doing it as you do on the stage, so it’s harder in ways.  You project differently.  But I think I like them equally.\n\nQ:  Tell me how Cotton Mary came about and what that was.\n\nJaffrey:  It’s a long, unhappy story, as far as I’m concerned.  A friend of my niece’s wrote it, and this particular niece happens to be in America, lives in America and is married to an American, but he’s a very strange American.  His father and grandfather were missionaries in India.  They are from Cape Cod, but they were American missionaries in India.  He was brought up in India, as my niece was.  He went to that school in Mussoorie [Woodstock].\n\nQ:  I do know what you mean.  I can’t think of it right now.\n\nJaffrey:  Then they sent him eventually to Oberlin, and my niece went to Oberlin because one of my daughters was at Oberlin, and they met there and they got married.  One of her best friends was the lady who wrote the screenplay.  So she brought it to me, and I took it on, with the idea of directing it, and we worked on it for several years.  Her husband was posted here and then in Bombay.  He was in the Foreign Service at that time, was a lawyer but had gone into the Foreign Service.  He was posted in Bombay, then he was posted in Paris, and we were sending these letters back and forth, and working on the screenplay together.  We did this for a couple of years.\n\tThen I suggested that we show it to Ismail, and Ismail was going to produce it.  Lo and behold, long story short, one day he was directing it, and I was really upset and mad, and I washed my hands of it.  I said, “You do it.  Cast anyone you want.”\n\tHe said, “You can’t do both.  You can’t act and direct.”\n\tI said, “I don’t want to act in it.  I want to direct it.  That was my whole dream.”\n\tWell, again, Ismail, you know how he is.  He went on and on and push and pull, difficult days, and eventually I said okay, and he directed it and I acted in it, but he gave me credit as co-director, though I did nothing, actually, except in the early days when I really helped with the script, absolutely from beginning to end.\n\nQ:  Was directing another skill that you wanted to have?\n\nJaffrey:  That I was dying to have, and I thought with Jim and Ismail’s help, I could do it.  I couldn’t do it on my own because I hadn’t studied it, but I knew I could visually—I have a very good visual sense—I could do it of technical people were helping me.  But then it just disappeared.\n\nQ:  In your autobiography, you talk about your mother’s influence in terms of your wanting to excel.  How does that play out, do you think?\n\nJaffrey:  Everything she did, as I said, she wasn’t educated.  She’d gone to the eighth grade, and [after she died], we found all these—I think I told you, all these medals and things that she’d won as a student, but it hadn’t gone beyond that.  So what did she do?  She did the things women do.  She embroidered, but perfectly.  That thing that you see there, that little crownlike thing, she made that.  One was for herself and the other was for her eldest son when he was born.  You know, when your horoscope is made, they tie that [on the heads of the mother and the baby like crowns.]  Anyway, everything.  Her clothes were beautiful.  She just had perfect taste.  She sewed perfectly.  Her food was perfect.  Everything she did, everything she touched was neat, clean, and perfect.\n\nQ:  Do you think you got some of your drive from her?\n\nJaffrey:  She had no drive.  My father had no drive.  I think I get it from my grandfather or something.  Certainly not from them.\n\nQ:  She had a drive in the sense of excellence in the activities.\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, but nothing beyond the house.  No dreams of the world or anything.  It was just in the house.  Very quiet, never talked up, as it were, never contradicted my father, you know.  But in her own way, she did everything so well, that I think that sense of perfection I get from her.\nI get my love of eating and the garden and all that from my father, who loved gardening, not that he did it himself.  There was a mali to do the work, but he supervised everything.  He wanted his garden to look a certain way, and he got all the trees, he got all the plants, he ordered all the seeds.  So I inherited that aspect of my father.\n\nQ:  I can’t remember if it’s in your book or not, but there’s a reference to him doing a little bit of catering and your tagging along, for weddings.\n\nJaffrey:  No, he didn’t do the catering.  The caterers came.  The caterers come and they set up tents, and these were special, wonderful caterers.  You’ve probably been to one of these things at weddings.  He would supervise the caterers, to make sure that everything was going well, because he was very interested in what they were doing.\n\nQ:  How young were you at that point when you would tag along?\n\nJaffrey:  From probably three, four.\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, you continued to do BBC documentaries, to win awards.  It’s all a lot.  [laughter]  It is.  You’re not slowing down at all.\n\nJaffrey:  No.  I really, really say that, but I get so anxious when I’m not doing anything.\n\nQ:  I understand completely.  The EastEnders I didn’t expect to find.\n\nJaffrey:  That just came out of the blue.  Again, it was an acting job and I was not getting enough of them.  This is seen by everybody.  They just showed my set of episodes in the last month, and people were talking to me here about it, so obviously it’s shown everywhere.\n\nQ:  Was it fun?\n\nJaffrey:  It was.  It really was.  I was the matriarch in a particular Indian family in this thing, and I met a whole lot of young kids who were of Indian origin, but they weren’t Indian kids.  They knew nothing about India—they would ask questions like, “Are you Punjabi?”  [And they said that they did not know!] I thought, you know, in India everybody knows what state they come from.  They had no clue, and they weren’t curious about it either.\n\nQ:  What made you decide to write Climbing the Mango Trees?\n\nJaffrey:  I did not want to write an autobiography of any kind.  My editor in England kept saying, “You should do one.  You should do one.”  And finally I said I would, but I wouldn’t go beyond twenty-one.  So at least that would protect this part of the family, and somehow everything else has a little distance and many people are dead.  But then when I began writing it, I realized that I couldn’t even go beyond eighteen.  It was just too difficult and too many people involved.  It’s been hurtful to a lot of people, so when people say, “We want to know what happened when you came to America,” I do want to write that, I do want to write what happened in America, but if I could leave the family out in some way, I would write it.\n\nQ:  It was hurtful because people didn’t like the way they were described?\n\nJaffrey:  Sometimes they were wonderful descriptions, like how much I adored them, how beautiful they were, but, like my sister, who was so beautiful, didn’t enjoy being called beautiful.  She said, “No, no, no.”  They’re very private.  They’re very, in their own way, conservative.  They’re not conservatives, but conservative.\n\nQ:  Tell me where you write and how.  Do you write on the computer now?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, I write on the computer.\n\nQ:  Do you need silence, lots of time?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, I need silence, and I’ll do it at night.  There’s no set time.  Some people are very disciplined.  I’m not, because I do so many things.  So when I have time, I do it.  When I’m working on a cookbook, I’m always behind, or any book.  I’m behind, so I’m always rushing at the end.  I can do eighteen-hour days.  I do them every time towards the end.  I’m also highly motivated at that time to get it all right and finished.\n\nQ:  Tell me about the Law and Order episodes.  Do you enjoy doing those?\n\nJaffrey:  Yes, it’s fun, fun meeting—it’s an acting job.  It’s not a great acting job, because I haven’t had parts in Law and Order that really stand out in any way.  It’s a job.\n\nQ:  You haven’t killed anyone.\n\nJaffrey:  No.  [laughs]  I haven’t killed anyone.  One of the things I did, something on Psych, I was going to be a suspect, at least, but they sort of killed that aspect of it, so then I was just an ordinary character.  Sometimes television here and there, but nothing I would say, “You must see this.”  It’s okay.  Just jobs.\n\nQ:  What kind of acting do you want to do now?\n\nJaffrey:  I would love to do something really worthwhile on the stage and on film.  It doesn’t really matter where it is, whether it’s television or stage.  It just has to be a part that makes sense, that has a beginning, middle, and end, and goes somewhere.\n\nQ:  I suppose that’s not easy to come by at all these days.\n\nJaffrey:  Not for me, no. \n\nQ:  Because of—\n\nJaffrey:  I’m thought of as Indian, you know.  I would rather be thought of as just a woman.\n\nQ:  What are you working on now?\n\nJaffrey:  I don’t really like to talk about that, because nothing is settled.  I have several things possible right now that I will probably get decided next month, but until they get decided, I’d rather not talk about them, only because it may not happen.\n\nQ:  When you are at loose ends, do you care whether it’s writing or acting?\n\nJaffrey:  No.  I would die for a good acting job, but there have been just so many almost things.  I mean, I almost did a wonderful series which was going to be incredible, and we shot three episodes—it wasn’t even a pilot.  We shot three episodes and then it got cancelled.  Things like that have happened, so I just now stay off it, don’t discuss it till it’s actually going to happen.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Is there anything we haven’t talked about that you feel you would like to talk about?\n\nJaffrey:  No, not really.  You may have questions once you’ve put it all together.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you tell me what you’re making for dinner tonight and why, because it’s so contemporary.\n\nJaffrey:  It’s so odd what I’m doing.  We had been to one of these food festivals that you go to and people give you things.  So we’d been given these gorgeous Allen Brothers steaks, you know.  So they were sitting in the freezer.  I have this one grand-nephew, as I said, who loves meat and his whole version of America is that he’s going to get a lot of meat.  So I invited two of the kids—a grand nephew and a grand niece.  He loves meat and she loves vegetarian food.  So she said she couldn’t come.  So we planned this whole thing and it was going to be Western.  It was going to be either scalloped potatoes with it or potatoes with rosemary and garlic or something like that, and then maybe some squash, some little Western food and a steak, or steaks, these great, lovely pieces of meat from Allen Brothers.\nBut now she’s called this morning and said, “Actually, no, I think I can come.”  So I said, “Okay, fine.  We’d love to have you.”  [laughter]  So now I’m going to do the steaks, but I would put a few Indian spices on them, so the meat is sort of slightly leaning a little bit, maybe cumin, maybe ginger or something on it, and I will cook the steaks the regular way, but on the side I would have dal, which I’m making, and some rice and maybe three or four vegetables done in a slightly Indian way so the grand-niece can have her vegetarian food.\n\nQ:  It sounds like it will be very delicious in any case.\n\tThank you so much for doing this.\n\nJaffrey:  Thank you.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tJaffrey - 2 -  PAGE 57\n\n\n\n"}]}
