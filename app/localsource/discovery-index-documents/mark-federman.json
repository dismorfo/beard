TTT\n\nInterviewee:  Mark Federman\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #1\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t           New York City\n\nDate:  January 25, 2011\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is January 25, 2011, and I’m with Mark Federman at Russ & Daughters on the Lower East Side.\nGood afternoon.\n\nFederman:  Good afternoon to you.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we start with your telling me a little bit about where and when you were born, who your parents were, get into your education, and, of course, the food you ate.\n\nFederman:  I was born on the Lower East Side and, in fact, a block and a half from here.  I was born on Ludlow Street.  I guess if I’m lucky, I’ll probably die here too.  But it’s different.  My story starts here and my family story starts here on the Lower East Side, although it really starts back on the other side, meaning that part of Eastern Europe which was known as Galitzia, a province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but my grandfather never spoke about that part of his life.  It’s like when he landed here in 1907, he just sort of buried that whole thing.  He was like twenty-one years old.  I assume it’s because life was very difficult.  The Russ family doesn’t come from royalty; we come from poor peasant stock in a shtetl, a little town.\nI’m now in the process of trying to uncover some of that stuff for purposes of writing a book, the Russ & Daughters book.  But at any rate, I asked my mother and my aunt.  There were three Russ daughters, and I’m the son of the youngest Russ daughter, Anne.  There was Hattie, the oldest, she’s alive and she’s about to be ninety-eight; Ida, who died ten years ago at eighty-six; and my mother, Anne, the baby of the Russes, who’s about to be ninety years old.\nSo life really started for him here on the Lower East Side, because he came over here, he was sponsored by a sister who had preceded him here, Chana Russ Ebbin, and she was in the herring business on the Lower East Side.  She had gotten here a few years before him.  The herring business then was basically a couple of barrels of herring and a stall which was usually between two buildings.  People would pass by in the street, and the herring was cheap, maybe two cents, five cents each.  The herring would be picked out of a barrel, wrapped in newspaper, and taken home for a meal, maybe sometimes two meals, meaning one meal, if they were really poor, they would just rub the herring across a piece of bread, and that was a meal, and the second meal was actually the herring.  In the newspaper they’d put potatoes, onions, and stick it in a coal-fire stove and that was a meal.\n\nQ:  Why herring?\n\nFederman:  Herring was plentiful and cheap and it was something they had on the other side, salt-cured fish.  Before refrigeration, how do you preserve foods?  It was by salting or drying, smoking them, curing them, pickling them.  Those were the ways to do it.  And herring was a plentiful food all around the world.  Herring was a food fish around the world, and every culture has some form of herring or some word for herring, although I vouchsafe to say that my grandfather had nothing to do with herring, nor his family over there, but they would have seen herring someplace and probably eaten herring cheap over there too.  Herring basically then came from the north Atlantic, and they were known as schmaltz and schmatzes, German and Yiddish for “fat,” and the fat herrings of the north Atlantic are the best. The fatter fish, the better fish.\n\tSo at any rate, he got here and was sponsored by his sister, and the sponsorship in those days was maybe twenty-five dollars, which represented a lot of herring at maybe a nickel each, but she needed help in her business because she married a guy, Isaac Ebbin, who woke up one day and decided he wanted to be a Talmudic scholar and had no time for running this business, however little ungapatchka business it was, or for the many children he had impregnated in her.  So he then was busy with praying and studying, and she called for the younger brother, Joel, pronounced “Yoel,” but Joel Russ.  There was always a question whether Russ was really the name on other side, and turns out by my research—and I had a genealogist just do this—yes, Russ was the name.  It was not uncommon over there in the province of Galitzia, particularly, and may have referred to people who, generations before, emigrated from Russia back into this area, fleeing the czar’s army.  You’ve heard that story about how the czar’s army, conscription lasted twenty-five years and was basically a death sentence for a Jew because there was no kosher foods being served.  At any rate, that’s sort of the family story.\n\tBut the point is that when he got here, it wasn’t about what happened in the old country; it was about this is a new country, this is a new life.  That’s it.\n\tI was born on Ludlow Street, as I said, above something called, sixty-five years ago, Yavarkovsky Paper Distributing Company, which was there until very recently and was basically a series of little warehouses, one-story warehouses, except that Joseph Yarvakovsky, the founder of this in 18-whatever, at some point one of his children, one of his sons became a dentist, so he built above the warehouse a second floor, and the front was an office for his son the dentist.  So that they should bring in some money since he wasn’t going to charge his son rent, he put an apartment in the back, and so my mother moved us there.  I was born while she was living there.\n\tShe was busy, shortly after I was born, chasing my father around, who was in the service at that point.  This was the very end of World War II.  Then she gave me over for nine months to my father’s mother, who lived in Brooklyn on Empire Avenue not far from Ebbets Field.  I didn’t like that grandmother, and I grew up not to like the Dodgers, so I was a Yankees fan.  [laughter]\n\tSo we lived there some years and then ultimately my grandfather moved the entire family out of the Lower East Side to Far Rockaway, but preceding that, there had been many attempts to get the family out of Lower East Side.  This is a very typical Jewish Lower East Side immigrant story.  This was not a place, the Lower East Side, where you wanted to settle.  It was an awful area.  It was always awful.  In the early 1900s, late 1800s, from 1880 to 1923 is like a million and a half Jews came here to Lower East Side.  There were several million who came.  Some of them wound up in Baltimore, in Galveston, and various ports, but the Lower East Side was the major catch basin until 1923 there was some kind of nativistic law that set a quota so that there would be no more Jews or southern Italians, sort of directed as Eastern European Jews and southern Italians.\n\tSo this was an awful area, and my grandfather made several attempts to get his family out of here.  When he first married, an arranged marriage, he moved to Brooklyn, Myrtle Avenue, and he set up a candy store with his wife, and that lasted a few years.  That was in 1910 he moved out there, and by 1914 he came back to Lower East Side and bought a preexisting smoked-fish store.  “Store” is sort of a grandiose term for whatever it was.  It was like a little space, but the guy who owned it before ran it as a smoked-fish place, and my grandfather took that over and ran it for many years, until in the 1920s he moved his business around the corner to its present location.\n\nQ:  Did your grandmother continue to help at the store?\n\nFederman:  My grandmother was not one for working retail.  Not that she wouldn’t work hard.  She was a peasant lady, very hardworking, apparently a lovely lady, but she was an illiterate and didn’t read nor write English or Yiddish.  My grandfather would at times, in one of the few demonstrations of some tenderness, it was the custom for him to read her something called the Bintel Briefs.  The Bintel Briefs were in The Forward and they were basically Dear Abby kind of things. “My husband ran off.  I’m starving.  What do I do?”  “Dear Reader, do this.”  It’s all in Yiddish, so he would read her that.  But there was never any great show of affection.  She would call him by his last name, Russ, but they pronounced it in the Eastern Europe “Roose,” something like that, and he would call her Zug, which means basically “Hey, you.”  [laughter]  So this was not a love match, but I think it was very typical. \n\tBut anyhow, he would move the family out and then didn’t have much money, move back to the Lower East Side.  The point is, the Lower East Side was a place to get out of.  He finally got the family out, the family meaning his wife and his three daughters, when they were young.  In 1926 he bought a big house in Flatbush on Avenue O.  It was a two-family house with two stories, two kitchens, two of everything, including two mortgages.  He had two mortgages.  So the Crash happened in 1929.  In 1932, two bankers showed up and said, “Mr. Russ, it’s your house or your business.”  By then his business was over here.\nThe family mantra, the family slogan in Yiddish was “Vi remptman parnosa.“ From where do we take our living?”  Basically, “How do we survive?”  This was all a matter of survival.  In those days, there was nothing celebrated, romantic about this kind of business, and there were lots of these appetizing stores on Lower East Side.  They were serving daily needs of the people down here.  There was twenty, thirty.  I mean, there were a lot of them.  Basically they were herring stands and then they had some smoked fish and everything was cheap.  You know, that was life.\n\nQ:  Why were they called appetizing stores?\n\nFederman:  Well, nobody knows the answer to that.  Every five or ten years, The New York Times forgets they’ve asked me this question, and they call me, “Hey, Mark, we want to know.  We have a reader.”  You know that “For Your Information” whatever?  “We have a reader who wants to know why it’s called an appetizing store.”  \nMy stock answer is, nobody knows.  There are various theories.  I was on a panel once with Mimi Sheraton, and she had some explanation that dated to a Spanish thing.  I sort of wonder.  But I’ve never heard that before.  So everybody’s free to make up an explanation.  I don’t know the answer.  But the food is appetizers.  It’s not designed to really be a meal, and it couldn’t be called a delicatessen because the very reason for its existence was to separate it from the stores and delicatessens in which meat was served, since this product was generally served with dairy, cream cheese later on, or butter and whatever, the cream sauce.  So the kosher laws, you couldn’t mix meat and dairy, so this gave rise to this thing.  I don’t know if there were any appetizing stores in Europe.\n\nQ:  Where does the word “appetizing” come from?  Is it meant to be an English word or derived from something else?\n\nFederman:  I have no idea.  I don’t know what the derivation would be.  Delicatessen has a derivation, a French derivation, “delicate eating” or something.\n\nQ:  Sounds like it was created here. \n\nFederman:  Appetizing.  It probably was.  It probably was, and lots of people, I’m sure, would lay claim to being the originator of that, but who knows.  Who put together the bagel, cream cheese, and lox for the first time?  Who knows.  So it’s fair game.\n\tAnyhow, we’re far away from my youth.  Do you want to go back?\n\nQ:  Whatever you—\n\nFederman: I could tell the story of the family, because I’m in the process.  I’m retired now, and what am I doing in my retirement?  I’m thinking about these things and trying to write them down, I mean, what happened to the Russ family.\n\nQ:  We want to get you here.  We don’t want you to sort of pop up.\n\nFederman:  Okay.  So the point is that it was moving out and moving back.  If you had money, you moved out.  From the 1880s to the 1920s or 19-whatever, a lot of Jews, pushcarts in the streets.  You’ve seen pictures of this thing.  According to my Aunt Hattie, you can’t believe how crowded it was.  \nI go to Florida every once in a while to see if I can get my aunt and mother—they’re very smart and very sharp.  They’re not so mobile, but they’re sharp and smart, but they’re not really wanting to remember this stuff because it was not a good life for them, so you’ve got to sort of prod around, and every once in a while you’ll uncover a little thing and they’ll say something, and you realize it’s a gem and get excited.  “What are you interested in that for?”\n\tBut Aunt Hattie says it was awful, and she was born in Brooklyn, 1913.  1914, my grandfather moved them back to Lower East Side and had his wife, my grandmother, and the eldest Russ daughter, the one who was born in 1913, my Aunt Hattie, living in the back of that little store, very dark and dismal and crowded in the streets, terrible.  And then her sister came along, less than two years younger, Ida, the middle daughter.  Then at some point he moved the family from the back of the store across the street, on Orchard Street now, right around the corner here, to a tenement, a fourth-floor apartment, which was a cold-water flat, toilets out in the hallway.  They’d go out on the fire escape for some coolness in the summer, the streets teeming below.\nAunt Hattie remembers that she was put in charge of watching Ida as they were growing up, and Aunt Ida was just uncontrollable, running around the pushcarts in the street, and Aunt Hattie, the oldest, was so worried about her and then would lose her and have to go up to the roofs of the tenements, where Ida would be hiding, and Aunt Hattie would try to scare her, “You’re going to get caught by Jack the Ripper.”  Apparently in those days, there was some fear for these kids.  But nothing stopped Ida.\nMy grandmother was working in the store, but she was an illiterate, she couldn’t read nor write, nor did she have a head for business, and so she would have to ask the customers how much they owed, which was not necessarily good for business.  My grandfather would be out on a horse and wagon delivering smoked fish around to whatever restaurants were around the area, but it turned out that it couldn’t last because his wife just was not capable really of running the business.\nOkay.  So that’s the scene that’s set up, and then he gets them out as far as Corona Queens.  I think the first stop was Williamsburg he moved them to, then maybe had them move to Lower East Side, then to Corona Queens, where my mother, the youngest, is born in 1921, and in 1926 he moves them to the Flatbush house and they lose it in 1932, when they move back to a terrible tenement on the Lower East Side.  I think it was on Second Street, a terrible apartment, and Hattie said it was awful, roach-infested.  She freaked out when she was taking a bath and some giant cockroach jumped in the bath.  They had to get out of there, and my grandfather was able to break the lease because of cousin Sylvia.  Who was cousin Sylvia?\n\nQ:  Who is Sylvia?\n\nFederman:  Sylvia is the daughter of Tante Pepe.  Who’s Tante Pepe?  Tante Pepe, Pepe for Pauline, was the sister of Grandma Russ, Bella Russ, but the two sisters didn’t get along well.  There was some envy there because Pepe had married a barber, whereas Bella had married Joel Russ, who had his own store, but Grandpa Russ, who was known to be very proud and arrogant—that seems to be a trait, actually, that I’ve inherited.  I think it skipped a generation.  [laughter]  At any rate, Grandpa Russ called in the services of Sylvia.  The barber, I think the last name was Peters or Trumpet [phonetic] or whatever, he had lots of kids.  He and Tante Pepe had lots of kids, but he was able to get each one of his kids—this is in the [Great] Depression—a good job in like civil service stuff, using his connections with the people whose hair he was cutting.  So the barber did all right, and cousin Sylvia, his daughter Sylvia, he got a job with the Board of Health or something.  So they call in the services of Sylvia to condemn the roach-infested apartment so they could break the lease.  [laughter]\n\tThey then move the family to—now I’m talking about 1930-something.  They move the family to the Ageloff.   The Ageloff, which was built and opened in 1929 and built and marketed as the luxury building of the Lower East Side, uptown, downtown.  I saw, in looking through some marketing material, they touted—well, according to my mother, they had a doorman with white gloves, they had elevators.  They exist and they’re inhabited.  They’re on Avenue A, basically.  They front on Avenue A from Third Street to Fourth Street, the whole thing.  It’s a huge complex, twelve stories.  All the other buildings in the area were tenements of six stories.  So this was unusual.  I think they had stone lions in the doorway and they had the gloved doorman, they had elevators, they had all of this stuff, so Grandpa Russ moved the family there in probably 1936 or ’37.\n\tWhen I heard this story from my mother and aunt the first time, I said, “How did the Russ family—?”  See, whatever I’ve heard, I have this image of a poor, hardworking immigrant family of fishmongers, herring mongers.  It wasn’t even fancy fish; it was herring mostly, right?  What were they doing in the luxury building of the moment on Lower East Side?\n\nQ:  When you say he moved the family, how much of the family does that mean?\n\nFederman:  Well, that’s the point.  All of the family.  All of the family consisted of Joel Russ and his wife Bella, my grandparents, their three daughters, Hattie, Ida, and Anne.  Two of the daughters by this point, Hattie and Ida, had gotten married, so their husbands were in there, Murray and Max.  They also had gotten pregnant and given birth quickly, so the babies were in there, Nina and Lolly, and the two maids, they say.  I said, “What?  We had maids?”  And the response is, how much could it cost in those days?  A maid was like fifteen dollars a month and they were happy to work.\nSo they had two maids, because Mama was busy taking care of the kids because the Russ girls worked in their father’s store, and shopping and cleaning and whatever.  They had two maids.  One was from Czechoslovakia and Mama was able to communicate with her in some Slavic tongue.  The other was from the Deep South and spoke English, except nobody was able to understand her.\nIn the Ageloff, they had this group of people—and we’ll count up how many; I forget—this group living in a two-bedroom apartment with one bathroom.  So one bedroom was Grandma and Grandpa Russ.  The other bedroom was, I think, Ida and Max.  The living room became the bedroom of Hattie and Murray.  The dining room became the bedroom of my mother and the two maids and the babies, or the babies may have been with their parents.  That’s how the Russ family was able to live in the hoo-hah fancy-schmancy building on the Lower East Side and have maids.  And they only had to walk from Third Street and Avenue A, or Fourth Street, over here to Houston Street.\nNow, this is during the Depression.  “How bad were things in the Depression?” I asked.  I said, “Would you consider yourself poor?”\n“No.  Everybody was in the same boat.  We always had what to eat.”\n\nQ:  What about the sisters working in the store?  How unusual was that or ordinary?\n\nFederman:  Totally unusual, totally.  Then by 1936, my grandfather—the store had been known as J. Russ Cut-Rate Appetizers.  I said to Aunt Hattie, “Was that the name?”\n\t“Yeah.”\n\t“Why was it called Cut-Rate?”\n\tAunt Hattie said, “I have no idea.  Everything was so cheap in those days, what rate could they cut?”  And two doors away was another appetizing store, H. Eisenberg Cut-Rate Appetizers.  It turns out that little anecdote is that Harry Eisenberg worked for my grandfather for some years, but he was religious.  My grandfather was not.  Harry Eisenberg, the deal they had was that Harry Eisenberg—my grandfather would work on Saturday and Harry would be off.  My grandfather would then take off on Sunday and Harry would work.  Then they would, I guess, work together during the week.  So that was the arrangement until, as I understand—I just spoke to Harry Eisenberg’s son, who I know, Murray, who’s in Florida, retired, way in his eighties—apparently my grandfather, Joel Russ, asked Harry to come in on Saturday nights after Shabbat was over, and Harry lived in the Bronx, so that he should take care of the trade that was coming in, the after-theater crowd from the Yiddish theater that existed along this whole area here, Second Avenue, mostly.  And Harry refused.  \nThat was the end of that relationship, and Harry opened two doors to the left or right, depending on which way you’re—but according to my aunt, Harry really couldn’t compete.  He didn’t have the same merchandise and he didn’t have the three pretty daughters selling the stuff, but he lasted some years, not too many.  Then I think he went to work for Scotty’s or somebody, another appetizing store in the neighborhood.\n\tSo the deal with the women was not usual, and the concept of calling it something & Daughters, Russ & Daughters, was definitely unusual.  There are those who ask me sort of rhetorically, “So your grandfather was an early feminist or women liberationist.”\n\tI say, “You don’t know my grandfather.  Definitely not.”  But if anything, he had a business sense, and he knew of all the twenty or thirty appetizing stores here, they would have over the door somebody Cohen or, Saperstein & Sons.  Nobody had “& Daughters,” and he had three pretty daughters and they were starting to get married, and he wanted Russ & Daughters.  It didn’t say Russ & Daughters & Sons-in-law.  It was Russ & Daughters.  So that’s what happened.  Their husbands ultimately became partners, but it would never be called anything other than Russ & Daughters, and he was very proud of that.\nIt also was sort of a recognition of a business necessity.  My grandfather was, I suspect, a typical Eastern European self-taught hardworking survivalist to the Lower East Side, and in that, he wasn’t long on patience.  I’ve inherited that also.  So if they gave him a hard time, which typical customers here do, “I don’t want that one.  What do you think, I’m a greenhorn?  You want to give me that?  Go in the back and get me—no, don’t try to give me that one.”  And if they did that to my grandfather, his response in Yiddish—and I haven’t gotten the Yiddish translation—was to the effect of, “Lady, do me a favor.  Lose my address.”  [laughter]  But this is not a great attitude if you’re in retail.\nFortunately, he had three pretty young daughters who started working when—I think Aunt Hattie, when she was eleven, and Aunt Hattie never finished high school.  Ida was allowed to finish high school and my mother, too, but it was clear that they would be coming into the business.  So they started as young girls on the weekends, and then when they finished school or dropped out, they worked full-time.  They were able to charm and disarm the crowd, the toughest customer, and the customers here in those days were tough, and it was shopping as a cross between an art form and an act of war.  You weren’t going to put anything past these customers.  They’d watch you, make sure all your fingers were off the scale.\nWhen I came in in the beginning of 1978, which is long past all of this, I inherited still some of those customers and there are anecdotes about some of these that I remember.  This kind of customer really doesn’t exist anymore, but it’s something I grew up with, and even before that would hear stories about this one and that one.  It’s something that I actually miss now.  These were customers that wanted not even a quarter, but a halb a fertl, half a quarter, an eighth of a pound of lox, and at the same time wanted your kishkes, your insides, on the scale at no extra charge in the package, right?\nSo it was a constant challenge to deal with this when I came in.  It was also me being puffed up and being a lawyer.  I practiced law for a number of years, and here I was, and they were going to try this, and I was going to let them know I was a lawyer.  Well, that didn’t work.  They couldn’t care less if I was a lawyer behind the counter, there was something wrong with me.  “What happened, you failed?”  [laughter]\nBut I miss that kind of customer.  Now what you find is--because we’re somewhat celebrated because we’re still around.  If for no other reason, we’re around.  And this kind of business is not around anymore.  It’s too hard.  Why would you do this kind of thing?  This is not a good business model.  It’s labor-intensive, it’s a product that’s very expensive to us and finicky.  It’s a labor force that doesn’t exist; you have to create it.  Then once you create it, you’ve created prima donnas.  This does not make sense as a business model of an appetizing store anymore, so you don’t see any new appetizing stores anymore, really.\nWhere was I?  But now because we’ve been around so long and dedicated to our business, we’re dedicated to our customers, to our product, and we [unclear] to that, every piece of fish, every customer, whatever, we got caught up in this whole celebration of food.  I don’t know when that started, in the eighties or nineties, Food Network, Food Channel, food this, Hot Chefs, Star Chefs, whatever.  The food world got like Hollywood, and somebody must have said, “Hey, look at Russ & Daughters.  They’re cool.”  And once somebody says that, everybody says that, and then all of a sudden you have this aura about you, whereas to us, the Russ family, we’re still the herring mongers on the Lower East Side, dedicated to our products.  But now they come in, the customers, and they thank you.  Whoever heard of a Jewish customer thanking you for waiting on him?  It was like somebody was doing somebody else a favor.\n\nQ:  Which you are.\n\nFederman:  Right.  So they thank you.  They wait.  If you’re here before a holiday, used to be before Yom Kippur, the break fast, the place is crowded.  Now, that’s an ugly scene.  We can get into this later, but that’s like thousands of Jews have a headache in advance, thinking about not eating for twenty-four hours.  They’re not in a good mood.  Then there are always those that feel sort of entitled, a celebrity.  “I’ve been shopping here since your grandma.  What, me take a number?  What is that?  I should take a number?”  [laughter]\n\nQ:  When did you come along?\n\nFederman:  I came along September 2, 1945.  I was actually born in Beth Israel Hospital, but we lived over here above Yavarkovsky Paper Company.  Remind me at some point to tell you the story of Yarvakovsky and my grandfather.  But I was born then.  Then within about four or five years, my grandfather had finally gotten us out of Lower East Side, he expected for good, and it was, to Far Rockaway, moved the whole family.  He was constantly moving the family and never telling anybody.  We would come home and we’re moving.  Wouldn’t tell his wife, wouldn’t tell anybody.  Made a decision—this is my grandfather—“We’re moving.”  And so they picked up and he moved everybody out to Far Rockaway, and that’s basically where I grew up till I went off to college, which was a very lovely insular Jewish, mostly Jewish community.  You know where Far Rockaway is on the peninsula?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFederman:  And in those days it was quite lovely.  As a kid growing up, you get on your bike and go anyplace, the bay, the beach, whatever.\n\nQ:  Did the whole family go out there?\n\nFederman:  Yes, the whole family did.  By then, the middle daughter had left the family, left the business, she and her husband.  It’s never quite clear whether she was fired by my grandfather or she quit, but it’s clear they didn’t get along.  The irony here, jumping way ahead, is that there’s a family plot at Beth David Cemetery, the Russ family plot, he bought twenty-nine gravesites, so his children and their husbands and the grandchildren and husbands and wives, and it’s on a corner, a corner plot.  This was real estate.  A lot of the old Jews came over, it was about real estate; they bought some property here on Lower East Side, whatever.  But this was a piece of real estate and twenty-nine gravesites, with a big oak tree and a stone bench.  “You should come, bring some food, sit down, have a visit.”  [laughs]  Aunt Ida, who’s the first Russ daughter to die in 2001, got buried.  Joel Russ and Bella Russ, they are there, 1959, 1962, I think.  But then Ida Russ Schwartz [phonetic], the middle aunt, died in 2001, she’s buried right next to her father, and they fought all of the time.  I think there’s something ironic about that.\n\nQ:  What were your expectations for yourself when you were going to high school?\n\nFederman:  Well, for myself or expectations for me?  They’re two different things.  What I was going to tell you is, just to relate my youth to our business here, so we moved out and the concept was to get out of Lower East Side and into suburban life.  It was post war America and New York and everybody was moving someplace, buying houses.  Levittowns were being built and whatever.  That was the dream, right?  So my grandfather picked Far Rockaway by the sea.  Maybe he wanted to be by water and fish.  Who knows why he did.  But it was a schlep to get into the city, so we moved out to get away from the Lower East Side, but it occurred to me at some point, maybe I was six or seven or eight, that we really brought the Lower East Side with us, and we did it by virtue of the smells that we brought, so that working in the store, my grandparents, my parents, my aunts and uncles, we all had a particular smell of this smokiness and fishiness and whatever, and you couldn’t help it.  You were around it all day long.  \nWe thought every house had a herring closet.  I was surprised to find out that there isn’t a herring closet; it was just our family.  So when they came home from work, there would be a vestibule area, and you’d take off your smelly outer clothes so you wouldn’t bring it into the house.  They assumed it didn’t go into the house.  Of course, it did.  So, you know, it was clear, by virtue of the smell, that we were different, because our house smelled different and our parents smelled different.  No matter how many baths and how much cologne, we smelled differently than everybody else.\nThere’s other differences that I realized growing up, and someday I should discuss this with my sisters, to just see what their impressions were, is that everybody else’s parents, their fathers, mostly it was fathers working and mothers not, but their fathers would go to work, put on ties and jackets and whatever, they were teaching, they were this, maybe they had some business, they got dressed up, they smelled nice, they went to work, they came back, they commuted, and they worked five days a week, generally, and they were off on the weekends to do fun things with the family.  They’d go to Coney Island or they’d go whatever, Yankee Stadium, you know, whatever families do together.\nMy family worked on the weekends, and not just my father.  Now on the weekends the Russ daughters were given dispensation where they did not have to work during the week when they had children.  That was their sort of exit plan out of the business.  But on the weekends they would still have to work when it was busier.  They would sort of rotate shifts and stuff.  So now on the weekends, I don’t have a father or mother.  We’re taken care of, myself and my two sisters—I have an older sister and a younger sister—by my grandmother, my father’s mother, who I told you about, who was five foot high and five foot wide, and had the mouth of a tugboat captain and chain-smoked Pall Mall and was the worst possible cook imaginable.  This is not your sweet cuddly grandmother image.  And would chase me around the house with a knife.  She was like awful, scary, was a scary woman.  So she raised us on the weekends.  And all my friends were, like, terrorized by her too.  She would say, “Go play on your own block.”  They all lived on the block.  Everybody was intimidated.\nSo we were different there, because that was our weekend, and the day off, my father’s day off, they worked six days a week, and at this point they were commuting from Far Rockaway into the Lower East Side, which would take an hour each way, at least.  My father had one day off. \n\n[Telephone interruption]\n\n[Begin File 2]\n\nQ:  Go ahead.  So, from PS 104.\n\nFederman:  Right.  Benjamin Cardoza Junior High, which was the first experience being bused out of this little insular community of Far Rockaway, particularly Bayswater [phonetic], to this junior high school I think was newly built in the middle of the peninsula, so it got fed from the more affluent Jewish community of Belle Harbor and Neponset, and then the Far Rockaway community fed into this junior high school, but so did the not-so-nice neighborhoods, the Irish gangs from Rockaway Park and the Italian gangs from wherever they were, and the blacks.  All of a sudden there were blacks in the mix.  So junior high school is a weird period for people anyhow, I guess, for kids that age, of transition from whatever, pre-teen into teen, and then you throw us into the mix with all sorts of people we didn’t know about and it was suddenly scary, and then I got into fights.  It was not a great time.\n\tBut I also was part of this program they called SP. New York had this program, they were allegedly giving a test and identifying kids a little more bright than the others, so that they could segregate them and skip a grade, so I skipped a grade.\nThen I moved generally with this group of kids into high school, Far Rockaway High School.  I went to Far Rockaway High School, which was walking distance from the house, and I had my first girlfriend my senior year.  It was pretty good.  Looking back on it, I don’t recall now what particular emotions I had.  It seemed to me I was having a nice sort of childhood. \nWhat’s sort of significant was that we were required, from the time we were thirteen, “we” meaning myself, my sisters, my cousins, were required to go in and help out in the store on the weekends, so Saturday and Sunday, on a rotating basis.  So one would do it on Saturday and a Sunday, then another.  There were five of us to draw from, but by this point the middle sister and her kids were out.  So it was basically five of us to rotate, and nobody really wanted to work.  By this time I was thirteen, so my older cousin was twenty-one, married, and she was out.  So there were basically four of us.\n\nQ:  Were you taught how to slice fish?\n\nFederman:  No, no, no.  We were not allowed to work behind the fish counter, where there were sharp knives and it was all very active, hectic, and knives happening and fish happening, and you had to know what you were doing.  You could make or lose money, and nobody wanted to buy fish from a kid, which started to get a little more expensive.  We’re talking about in the 1950s.  So they didn’t want to see a kid behind a fish counter.  But there was a candy counter.  At some point my grandfather bought this building, the store.  I have pictures downstairs which show the original store here was half of its size, and the same address was shared by a little commission bakery to the left when my grandfather bought the building. Ultimately the people who had that Little Commission Bakery left and he was able to widen his store, so what was that little bakery store or stall is now our candy side.\n\tNow, why candy?  You know, I think about this.  I asked questions.  I have no idea why it became a candy side in an appetizing store.  You know, the theory is, we’re going to eat salty, fishy whatever, they needed candy, and it wasn’t just candy then.  The candies were primarily hard candies because every Jew of a certain age, usually older, always had hard candies in their pockets.  I don’t know if you grew up the same way.  My grandfather always had hard candies in his pockets, and usually one of several kinds.  There was a mint, I guess for the breath, or there was Hopjes.  I don’t know if you know Hopjes.  Hopjes, we still sell those.  It’s from actually Holland, made by Rademaker, and it’s a cube made out of coffee flavor.  It’s a coffee-flavored cube, and it was a favorite.  Then there was the honey sesame candies that were wrapped in cellophane.  The problem is they kept them in their pockets too long, they got sticky.  But always some kind of hard candy elderly Jews had, that they would eat themselves.  Maybe ate a lot of onions and garlic, maybe to kill that.  Or to give out to kids as treats.  The grandchildren always got some. \n\tAt any rate, most of the appetizing stores had candy being sold to them, so that other side became the candy side, had its own counter, its own scale.  I remember working there.  The scale was a balance scale, so you’d put the weights, which were quarter pound, half pound, one pound, two pound.  If you wanted five pounds, you’d have two two-pounds and one one-pound on one side, and the other side was this big sort of stainless steel scoopy thing where you put the candy, scoop it from a bin into there, and then there was this sort of needle that moved back and forth.  When it was directly in the middle, you had the right weight, because it balanced.  Then you would take that scoop and open a bag up.  Generally in those days it was a brown bag, and hopefully you’d get it all in the bag, and that was the sale.  Of course, the customers in those days would not accept right in the middle.  You had to give them an extra one so it was good weight.  When they said, “That’s good weight,” you knew you were going to be in trouble with your parents or aunts and uncles or something because you gave too much.\nBut we had to do that on the weekend.  We didn’t do it willingly.  They had insulated us, my parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles.  They had insulated our generation.  Here’s how I see it.  The concept was not to groom us to come into this business.  They had to do it.  My grandparents did it as survival, right?  They came over here and this is what they were going to do.  My grandfather brought his three daughters into the business for survival.  He didn’t have any sons and he didn’t do well with hired help.  At various times he had a nephew working, had his brother who came over.  None of that worked out well.\nSo his daughters were expected to come in, not to go to college.  That wasn’t an issue.  There was no expectation they were going to school.  They would come in and help out, and when they got married, he had sort of the right of first refusal.  Whoever they were dating, they didn’t have to see a matchmaker, it wasn’t going to be an arranged marriage like what happened to him, but he would size them up and I guess he’d say to himself, “This one can schlep a herring barrel, can slice lox and look good behind the counter and add up a figure of numbers on a brown bag with a pencil.”  So their husbands came into the business, and it’s all during the Depression.  So to be able to work in a store was, you know, some sense of security.  \nMy aunt tells me that she and her husband were the first—she was the eldest daughter.  She worked, her husband worked with her, and they were paid by my grandfather and they started in 1935, I guess, in the store.  They were paid twenty-five dollars a week for both of them, for six days a week, eight-, ten-, twelve-hours a day, but that was it.  He gave them a place to live in their apartment in the Ageloff and gave them what food to eat.\nBut nobody questioned anything, and nobody would question my grandfather.  That became clear to me as I’m trying to figure this guy out.  I knew him because I was sixteen or seventeen when he died.  This was also not a warm and cuddly figure.  He was sort of a stern bearing, and if you asked him a question that he wanted to answer, he would say, in his heavy European accent, “Ask me.  I’ll ‘splain you.”  “Ask me.  I’ll ‘splain you.”  Well, that set up the whole dynamic.  He was going ‘splain things to you and he was going to tell you.  That was it.  And he also—I mean, I’m getting this as I’m asking people questions, including his daughters—he was arrogant.  “Arrogant” may be too lofty a term.  He thought he was better than most other people.\nThere’s a whole anecdote I won’t go into now, but Rose Yavarkovsky, the daughter-in-law of Yavarkovsky, the paper goods guy, whatever, Rose is sort of an interesting case, since she is the daughter of a pushcart peddler who had a pushcart in front of the store, our store.  She wound up marrying Sol, one of the sons of Joseph Yavarkovsky, the paper dealer who had this basically on Ludlow, so everybody was talking, hoo-haw, how the peddler’s daughter had married up.  [laughter]  Rose Yarvakovsky worked until recently way into her nineties.  My Aunt Hattie says, “Rose is older than I am, though she won’t admit it, and I’m going to be ninety-eight.”  So I know until a few years ago, Rose would work every day—recently in the winter she would go to Florida—standing out front of her door on Ludlow Street with a mink coat and a clipboard, checking in the stuff from the big trailers of paper goods that would be dropped off, and then checking out the little vans of the jobbers who would take it, standing out there in the cold and whatever, doing it.\nRose Yarvakovsky told the story—and some day I’ll tell it to you, but the story basically winds up with Joel Russ was shtolt.  That was the word they used, shtolt, meaning proud but a pride born of arrogance.  Joel Russ thought he was better.  Even his daughter, who said yes to everything, “Yes, Papa, yes, Papa,” Hattie, the eldest daughter, knew—I said, “Were you friendly with the people on the block, the other stores?”\n“No, we kept to ourselves,” she said.\nI said, “Why is that?”\n“My father didn’t mingle.  He thought he was better than everybody else.”  So that was it.  And “what he said, what Papa said, that was it.  Nobody asked questions.”\nLet me know if I’m too far afield, because one thing leads to another.  But I just want to say that in the store, if you go into the store, you will see around, above the shelves, this—maybe you call it a soffit or something, which is made out of smoked white glass and it has black hand-lettered writing on it, each section of it.  This was done when my grandfather renovated the store and the shelving, whatever.  Each section has a name with something that was sold in the store, so it will say Nova Scotia, it will say Caviar or something.  It’ll say Sturgeon, whatever.  The very first section, the soffit there, this section looks out into the street, so this is what people would see if they were walking by, the very first one says Smoked Eel.\n\nQ:  Huh.\n\nFederman:  Right.  Until somebody asked me, I didn’t know, and I’m working here since I’m a kid, right?  I didn’t know it said that, or didn’t register.  So somebody said, “Why?”\n\tI said, “I don’t know, but I’m going to ask my mother and aunt.”  This was some years ago.\nSo I went and asked them, “Why does it say Smoked Eel?”\n“It says what?”  [laughter]\n“It says Smoked Eel.”\n“I don’t know.”\nI said, “Did you ever sell smoked eel?”\nAnd they said, “Yeah, but it was always in the back.  We never had it showcased,” and I know that because even when I came along, for Christmas and New Year’s the non-Jew Eastern European liked to eat smoked eel, and actually it’s quite good but it’s very ugly.  Jews don’t eat smoked eel not only because it’s not kosher, it’s because it’s ugly.  It’s like a snake.  They’re not going to eat it.  So we sold very little of it.  We sold only a few a year and only a certain time of year, and it was kept in the back.  So why then does the very first soffit, the one that everybody sees going by even out in the street, say Smoke Eel?  I asked my mother.  One, it just didn’t occur to them, and, two, if they knew it, they wouldn’t have asked their father. “ If Papa wanted it that way, he must have had his reasons.” “Shoyn, fartig” that’s it.\n\nQ:  Was he still around working in the store when you started working here?\n\nFederman:  I started working in—my bar mitzvah, so it was ’58.  He died in ’62.  He would come and go.  His retirement was putzing around with his garden in Far Rockaway, making some kind of wine out of raisins or cherries, sour cherries, making a syrup out of roses, and until my grandmother died in ’59, he was sort of shepherding her because she was sickly.  The move from Brooklyn back to the Lower East Side, once she got to Brooklyn in the two-family house with the big garden where she could plant things, she suddenly felt comfortable in America.  She was a poor peasant farmer.  When she had to move back, it broke her spirit and she never recovered from that.  So she was sickly after that.  I don’t know if he felt guilty, but he was more attentive in some respects, as attentive as he could be.\n\tSo he wasn’t really in the store, but before I came in, and when he retired, which is basically around 1950 or so, and he had all his daughters and sons-in-law in place, he’d basically take this old cracked leather chair that he had in his little office in the back.  I don’t know if you saw the office that’s back there.  It’s like the size of a bathroom.  Take his chair out and put it near the candy side, and now he would dress up in fancy suits, he had a cane because he had a problem with his foot, with like a gold handle or silver handle, and he would sit out in front.  He had a portrait made of himself, which had hung in the store, and he would sit under this portrait and he would point with his cane, I understood this from my mother and aunt, point to something and say, “Nicht a zoi” meaning, “Not like that.”  This was not a guy for compliments.  He would just tell you what not to do.  “Nicht a zoi.” \nSo he would come in by subway also from Far Rockaway, which is a major schlep, but to do that, to feel sort of busy or whatever.  So that’s it.\n\nQ:  So when you graduated from high school, then what happened?\n\nFederman:  Then the question was where to go to college.  Most of my friends were going locally to, like, Brooklyn or Queens or whatever it was, Brooklyn mostly in those days, and I decided I wanted to go out of town, and that may have been, now that I’m thinking about it, to escape the requirement of working in the store on the weekends and on holidays, which we were required to do.\nIn those days, what happened here is you had a guidance counselor in high school, and the guidance counselor would tell you three choices and those were the schools you applied to, unless you had a burning desire to go someplace you thought you’d get into.  So this guidance counselor I remember very well, Miss Kraft, who had a face like one of those apple people that gets all shriveled up.  It’s the only face I can remember from my teachers in high school.  Miss Kraft decided that the three choices for me were George Washington University, Alfred University upstate, and Grinnell College in Iowa.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nFederman:  And the only one I’d heard of is George Washington, but I decided I would make the rounds to see, so I went with my father.  He went with me to George Washington, and we went by plane.  It may have been the first time I was on a plane.  It was a bad, bumpy ride, so I ruled out George Washington.\nI went by myself then to Grinnell.  I had skipped a grade, so at the time I was looking, I was going to be fifteen and a half, and I got on a plane and I flew to Des Moines, Iowa.  Then I got on a bus for two hours in the flattest, ugliest land you’d ever see, and I got to Grinnell and I didn’t know anything about this place.  Then they assign you to some kid, a student who’s going to show you around and be your mentor for the weekend, and this kid is busy telling me how the townies like to beat up on the freshmen.  [laughter]  Then the sky opens, which apparently is not unusual, and thirty inches of snow came out of nowhere and fell down, and I decided I had to get out of there.  So I didn’t wait.  This all happened within twenty-four hours.  So I hitched a ride in to the Des Moines Airport, waited for the sky to clear, and took off.  I never told anybody, and I don’t think anybody missed me.  I was out of there.\nSo the school I hadn’t seen, the one that was left, was Alfred, so I said, “I’m going there.”  They offered me some kind of scholarship.  So I went to Alfred, sight unseen, and spent four very happy years.  It was a lovely cloistered kind of community.  I guess things were going on then, like maybe a sexual revolution and a drug thing.  Somehow that passed me by.  I wanted it, but—\n\nQ:  It didn’t get to Alfred.  [laughter]\n\nFederman:  It certainly didn’t get to me in Alfred.  So I spent four years there.  What’s of some significance is that Alfred was a land-grant school, and so ROTC was required for the first two years for the men.  So the two years, instead of gym, you put on a uniform and you spit-shined your shoes and polished your brass and stood in some kind of formation and pretended you were playing whatever, just to march around, got a haircut.  But what’s interesting, and I’ve never been able to really put my finger on why I did this, I volunteered to continue the second two years, and this was totally voluntary, and just a few guys did it.  I would suspect it had something to do with this John Wayne syndrome of putting on a uniform, playing soldier, getting the girls or whatever.  There was nothing dangerous happening in the world really at that time.\n\nQ:  Two years after college or an additional two years in college?\n\nFederman:  In college.  So I did that, and as it turns out, on graduation we went through the regular graduation, cap and gown, my parents came up, and it was the first time they had seen the school.  They came up for it, and after the regular graduation, we took off the cap and gown, and I and several of my classmates had uniforms underneath and we got commissioned as second lieutenants in the United States Army.  The problem was then, this was 1966 and Vietnam was starting to heat up, and so it was too late.  There were no backsies on this thing then.  But what I did do is get a deferral to go to law school.\n\nQ:  How did it happen that you were interested in law school?\n\nFederman:  By default.  What does a Jewish boy do who’s relatively successful as a student, and what is expected of you?  It certainly was expected we would come in the fish business.  That’s why they were all working so hard, so that we wouldn’t have to work like that and sell fish and smell like fish.  So I was probably the most successful, in academics, of my cousins and sisters, and so the question is me going on to grad school, and there was some thought of me going on for an M.A./Ph.D. in political science.  I was offered some program that was nice, but for whatever reason I can’t tell you, I think what happens is Jewish boys who can’t become or don’t want to become doctors or dentists or whatever, law is the next best thing.\n\tSo I picked law, and I got into Georgetown Law School and NYU [New York University], and I decided to pick Georgetown just because it was out of town.  Again, if you’re in town, you’re still part of the family, the Russ family, and you still have to work.  Remind me later to tell you what I’ve done to my kids to continue that tradition.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  This kept you out of the army?\n\nFederman:  No.  Deferred me.  So I was in law school for three years, from ’66 to ’69, living in Washington, D.C., in three different places in three different years.  I was there in 1968 when they burned down Washington during the riots.  You were there then, I presume, too, or you were out of town by then?\n\nQ:  No, I was here, actually.\n\nFederman:  Okay.  So we switched.  But I was there.  Because your family was there, I’m sure you’ve heard stories about that period.\n\tAt any rate, I didn’t have anything to do with the military.  I didn’t have a uniform, I didn’t have anything.  I forgot about it.  Then you finish, graduated law school, Georgetown, and seemed to me within a few days I got a notice, “Report for duty.”  Then I went on a trip to Europe—I hadn’t been there—with some friends, gadding around Europe.  You could do Europe on five dollars a day.  You remember the book?  It was Frommer or somebody, and you could do it and have change.  So we did that.\nThen I came and I just had no choice, because for me not to show up would have been desertion, right?  So I had done this thing to myself.  So the army had a plan.  I had a two-year obligation, and the army’s plan for me for the two years was the first year in Fort Polk, Louisiana.  Fort Polk, Louisiana, famous for large mosquitoes, large alligators, and larger rednecks.  None of those seemed exciting to me.  Then the second year they were going to send me to Vietnam.  By this point, we’re talking about 1969, it was quite hot.  It was right after ’68, the Tet [Offensive], Saigon was overrun.  So that was their plan for me, they told me, as if offering me, I don’t know, a Caribbean vacation.  “Here’s what we have planned for you.”\nI said, “Now, wait a minute.  We must be able to do something else.  Let’s discuss this.”\nThey said, “Well, actually, there is something we can do.  If you extend your obligation by a year, make it three instead of two, you can go for the first eighteen months anyplace in the world you want to go where we have an opening, and the next eighteen months we’ll send you anyplace we want to send you.”  I assumed that was going to be Vietnam anyhow, so I would put it off.\nSo I picked that option.  I picked for the first eighteen months San Francisco because I had a cousin living there that I liked.  I don’t know.  I didn’t want to learn a foreign language or whatever.\nSo I got to San Francisco in ’69 and I was assigned to Oakland Army Terminal on the other side of the Oakland Bay Bridge, and at the moment I showed up—this is what Jews call bashert.--the moment I showed up, they had no vacancies in the quarters on the base for officers.  I was a first lieutenant at the time.  So they gave me a stipend to go find my own apartment, which I did, across the street from my cousin in San Francisco.  I bought a car, I had an apartment, and every day I’d put on a uniform, drive over the Bay Bridge to work.  I had got assigned to the JAG office because I was a lawyer at this time, the Judge Advocate General’s Office, so I was, in effect, practicing law.  I’d drive home and take off the uniform, go across the street to hang out with my cousin and smoke some pot.  It was okay, not bad.\nEighteen months came and I’m ready for the letter in the mail.  Didn’t happen.  Nineteen months, twenty months, twenty-one.  I’m saying, “Shit, they forgot about me.  Thank goodness I’m here in San Francisco.”  But twenty-four months, basically, they located me and gave me orders to Vietnam.\nSo there I am with orders to Vietnam and I really didn’t want to go.  Didn’t seem to be a great prospect.  Lots of people were dying.  So my father had a customer or I’m not quite sure the connection, some customer who knew somebody, or may have been the guy himself, who was the head of something in New York, and he was a colonel and whatever, and the idea was for me to go and see him, to get out of going to Vietnam.  So normally I rejected my father’s offers of help in these things, but we’re talking about Vietnam, so I went.  The guy—I remember it—was busy telling me what an honor it was to go to Vietnam, and I’m sitting there in some Kafkaesque scene.  I left there, like, nauseous—I’m getting nauseous thinking about it now—knowing there’s no escape for me.\nI’m deaf in one ear, I was born deaf in one ear, and I thought maybe that would do something, so I tried to get out by virtue of that, and they said, “Oh, man, you’re a lawyer.  You’re going to be in Saigon.  You don’t have to hear anything.  Don’t worry about it.  Everything’ll be fine.”\nSo I took off in a plane with a bunch of other soldiers from McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, and this was in 1971, and flew to Anchorage, Alaska, to Yokota, Japan, to Bien Hoa Air Force Base outside of Saigon.  Okay.  You’re sort of adrenalized and it’s all different and whatever.  At this point I’m a captain, so I can’t start crying because I’m a captain, right?\n\nQ:  A captain in JAG?\n\nFederman:  No.  My assigned branch was AG, the Adjutant General, but I get assigned to JAG because I’m a lawyer.  They always need lawyers.\n\tSo I show up wherever I’m supposed to show up, and hand my papers and say, “Okay, I’m ready for JAG assignment in Saigon,” and it looks like it might be interesting.  And they decided that they needed an adjutant general—I was an administrative officer—in an advisory team in the Mekong Delta.  The last one got blown up on his Jeep, you know, sort of like one of these IEDs today.  I said, “You don’t want to do this to me.  I’m a lawyer.”\n\t“We don’t need lawyers now.  We need an AG.”\n\tSo the next thing I knew, they put me on a plane and our first stop was someplace called Cantho in the Mekong Delta, the headquarters of whatever army that was, 4th Army, whatever, in the Mekong Delta, and I was there for a while.  Now what I’m remembering is how terribly afraid I was.  Couldn’t believe I was in this scene.  This had never crossed my expectation radar.  And I was so vulnerable then.\n\tThey also had, which is strange, like out of a Fellini movie, a bunch of people floating around that were Jews for Jesus, trying to convert.  There weren’t that many Jews around, but they were Jesus freaks and were trying to convert people.\n\nQ:  In the army?\n\nFederman:  Yes, because if you’re going to die, you might as well die believing in Jesus and then the Rapture and whatever.  But I was so screwed up and vulnerable then, that they sort of had me on the ropes, and I might have gone that way except that I got shipped out just before I was ready to say, “Okay, take me, Jesus.”\n\tThen they shipped me out to—they put me on this big supply plane, I don’t know what you call it, C-something, the back opens up and they drive tanks into it, but all they put on that plane was me and some mail, sitting in this thing.  I don’t know, maybe we flew an hour, and it lands and the thing opens up again, and I’m in the middle of a rice paddy with some single strip of corrugated metal that the plane landed on.  I get out and the mail gets thrown out, and the thing closes up and takes off.  And there I am, thinking to myself, “What’s a nice Jewish boy like me doing in a place like this?”\n\tThen a guy comes up in a Jeep, sort of a hippie-type guy, and he says—he doesn’t say anything.  I say, “Oh, you’re here to pick me up?”\n\tHe said, “I’m here to pick up the mail.”\n\tI said, “Well, I’m assigned to the advisory team.”  That’s the only thing down there, so they took me there, and I was there just for a couple of months in the middle of nowhere.  Then they decided they needed a lawyer in Saigon, so they transferred me back for the remainder.  So that was the war.\n\nQ:  After Saigon, then what happened?\n\nFederman:  I came back to the States.  I was discharged from the army, and I’m sure you’ve heard the guys who came back, there were no bands playing for us.  Basically, took off the uniform, threw everything away.  You didn’t want to go around saying you just came back from Vietnam or even that you were in the army, because at that point you were recognized as something, a baby killer, not that I ever shot anybody, nobody ever shot at me, but it wasn’t a good scene.\n\tSo then the question was for me to figure out what to do with my life, and I started to get a little frayed.\n\nQ:  Where were you?\n\nFederman:  I was living at home with my parents in Far Rockaway then, in their house.  I started to get a little not so lucid, so I decided I needed a job right away, so I got a job.  At this point I had taken the bar in New York and passed it before I even went into the army, and when I was stationed in San Francisco I took the bar in California and I passed that, so I had two places, but I had a girlfriend, a longstanding girlfriend at the time in New York, so I decided to stay here.  I got a job here right way with Legal Aid in Brooklyn.  That lasted about eight months.  It was Legal Aid Family Court.  I didn’t like it at all.\nThen they opened up at that point a brand-new office, a prosecutorial office called the Office of the Special Prosecutor for the State of New York, and a guy who became somewhat famous/infamous, Maurice Nadjari.  The concept there, that whole office grew out of the Serpico—you know Serpico.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFederman:  So Serpico had blown the whistle, and as a result, they had hearings before a federal judge, called the Knapp Commission hearings, and as a result of all that, then Governor Rockefeller set up a commission to investigation corruption in the criminal justice system in New York.  Nadjari was named the head of it, and he was putting together a team of young aggressive prosecutors.  I was a defense lawyer for Legal Aid, but somehow I got that job.  For five years I was with that office, and it was somewhat exciting.  We were doing what we thought was good work.\n\tThen I decided I had to make some money because I was married.  I went to a private firm, a litigating firm uptown, and I did that for two years.  At this point I had two children.\nSo the question always is, and it’s a question I ask myself, why did I leave law?  I was doing relatively well in it, making some money, was on the right track.  Why did I leave that and come back into the family business?  And I do not have a good answer for that.  I don’t.  What’s clear is that practicing law wasn’t pleasing me that much, and I’d come home with an armful of files that I had to ready for the next day to go in court, and you never knew which one was going to go to trial when the judge said you’re on trial with that case.  My wife would be home with the two babies, and she wanted to tell me what happened that day, this kid did this and he ate this and he got sick with that, and this baby this.  I’d be trying to be the dutiful husband, looking at her, but my mind was clearly in court the next day, trying to figure out how to do whatever I had to do to win.  So I wasn’t in a comfort zone doing this.  I was doing fine, but wasn’t—I mean, the only thing I can say, it didn’t feel great to me.  It was okay, could have kept doing it.\n\nQ:  What was happening here?\n\nFederman:  What was happening here—the right question—is that by 1975 and leading up to that were two sets of Russes, Aunt Hattie and Uncle Murray, last name Gold, and my mother and father, the Federmans, and they did the business during the week, rotating on weekend shifts and whatever, and that’s for a long time.  Since the 1950s, that’s how the store ran, these two sets.  But by 1976, Uncle Murray and Aunt Hattie were retired.  They were older.  Can’t tell you how old now.  But they were retired.\nSo my mother and father were left here.  My father had an increasingly debilitating heart condition, so they began to talk about—or he did—selling Russ & Daughters.  He had tried to bring in various members of the family at various times, to no avail.  The ones that probably wanted to come in, he didn’t want.  But he never asked me to come in, never.  I was a lawyer and I was the guy he could brag about, “My son the lawyer,” right?  I was the only one of my generation of Russes who became a professional, so he liked to brag, “My son the lawyer.”  I assume he bragged when I was in the army, “My son the captain.”  Whether he bragged or not I was in Vietnam, I’m not sure how he felt about that.  I suppose he felt uncomfortable about it.\nAt any rate, so that’s what was happening.  It now became my mother and father.  He was increasingly ill.  The neighborhood had been into a downward spiral and it was just precipitous in the late seventies.  It was awful.  The late sixties, it sort of started.  Actually, after World War II, the guys came back, wanted out of the Lower East Side.  But it gathered more momentum, but by the late seventies, this neighborhood was awful.  I don’t know if you ever passed through here in the seventies or eighties.  This neighborhood was the pits.  \nOkay.  So business wasn’t doing well, he wasn’t doing well.  They were talking about selling it.  I suspect I wasn’t that happy doing what I was doing, so my bright idea, I came to him and said, “Look.  You want a partner?”  Not that he made me a partner.  [laughs]  “But I’ll work with you part-time and I’ll practice law part-time on my own.”  That was my plan.\n\nQ:  You didn’t dread being here?\n\nFederman:  No, I didn’t.  I’m surprised I didn’t, but I didn’t.  There was something always—as a kid coming in here, even though we came under protest, kicking and screaming, when the store was busy and all the stuff was happening, it was a show.  You see your mother and father and aunts and uncles dealing with these customers, and these customers, all this activity and vibrancy, and your parents and aunts and uncles are somebody special in there on their stage.  Then they would come over and I would say—my father’s Herbert—“Herbie, this your son?”  And they’d grab you by the cheeks.  “What a nice boychik.  Is he going to take over the business?’  And of course it’s the last thing that they wanted at that point.  But it was clear to me that my parents and aunts and uncles were somebody important in this store and were treated as such.\nOccasionally I’d get to ride with my father in the truck as a kid, like Take Your Kid to Work Day.  He would occasionally take me with him into work, but the first stop would be one or several smokehouses, to pick up the fish and pick out the fish, and you see what’s going on there, them yelling and cursing at each other, and the smells and whatever.  It was like show biz.  It’s frightening, it stinks, but it’s show business, something going on that’s out of the realm of normal life.  Then he’d stop at Ratner’s and take me.  You know Ratner’s, the dairy restaurant, right?  So Ratner’s.  He’d go in the back room and all his cronies were sitting there, who had businesses down here or whatever.  “Hi, Herbie.”\nOr even before that, coming over the bridge, there was a traffic cop at the end of the Williamsburg Bridge, so we’d come from Brooklyn smokehouses, from Far Rockaway, Queens, to the smokehouses in Brooklyn, over the bridge, and there’d be a traffic cop and they’d always wave to my father in the truck.  “Hey, Herbie!”  The cop is doing it.  In those days, cops were important.  So this was a cop paying homage to my father and saying hello, and if there was enough time to say, “Hey, you teachin’ your kid the business?”  \nAnd then to Ratner’s and the same group every day would be sitting there, ordering the same thing, and the same schlumpy waiter would come with the stuff and knew exactly what to give each guy.  I’d sit there, “Herbie, you brought your kid in.”  They’d all be doing what they did.  There was some drama about this that stuck.  The smells, the sights, the sounds, it stuck.\nSo I did what I was supposed to do, become a lawyer, the only one in my generation of Russes to do that, and then I decided—in the beginning I wasn’t giving it up.  My plan was to help them in the business, keep Russ & Daughters in the family—I think I recognized this place was something important—and practice law.  Well, the first day I came in here was the last day I practiced law, because it turns out—and I didn’t know this—this business is like overwhelming in details, and if you’re not paying attention to the details, you’re going to lose money.  If you’re not watching every piece of fish and every customer and how everything is handled, or watch the register, make sure the money goes in the register, I mean, there were no credit cards in those days, right?  It was all cash business.  So it’s like immediately overwhelming, and the idea of practicing law—so I tried to keep my hand in it by doing some kind of hearings as a hearing officer for this or that, but, you know, I got caught doing that in terms of I wasn’t in here at some point, and there was a New York Times reporter in here, didn’t like what she got, gave it a bad review, and I said, “Forget this law stuff,” you know.  So this became an obsession.  I became obsessive about this, maybe because I have an obsessive personality.\n\nQ:  What kind of obsession?\n\nFederman:  The obsession is to make sure everything is perfect at all times, beyond reasonable expectation, so that if the store looks beautiful but there’s a smudge on that—you see the showcase is glass in the front?  Okay, people have a habit of taking their hands, like they want to reach in, and they’re putting their fingerprints all over that showcase.  Everything in the store can be perfect, but if I’m seeing fingerprints on the showcase, it’s not.  And my fear is that somebody’s going to come in, the wrong person, and write up, “Russ & Daughters is dirty.  What happened with this generation?  They don’t have the ethic,” whatever.  So that haunted me.\nAnd whenever I thought about changing something, I was haunted by the notion, you know, what would my parents or grandparents or aunts and uncles think?  There was always a struggle.  So if I wanted to put coffee, sell coffee in the store, my mother would say, “We never sold coffee.  Who are you going to sell coffee to?”  Right?  “Why are you going to sell coffee?”  It was always a question.  “What do you want to do that for?”\n\tSo every step that I took was problematic for me, and the neighborhood continued to go down and I sweated out each customer one by one, made sure that I waited on most of them myself so I could give them my personal charm, whatever that was, but they knew the owner and they want the owner to wait on them, right?  And I knew that every piece of fish that went out went out with my name on it.  I’m a Russ and on the door it says Russ.  So I had that.\nThis is all a weight and an anchor, you know, in both senses of the word.  The anchor is, I’m anchored to a family history of doing something on the Lower East Side, and some people really appreciate that.  Because the old-timers go, they disappear for a year or so, they show up again, they want the same piece of fish in the same place.  If it’s not there, what have you done?  And I knew the store was physically getting tired itself.  The neighborhood continued to spiral down, I think, until the nineties.  It always had some interesting thing going on.  The people that moved out of the neighborhood, all the Jews had moved out, the ones who became affluent, they would buy a quarter pound of lox in their neighborhood, but when their families were coming over, their son the lawyer was showing up or was bringing the future machatunim over, or was celebrating a graduation, some special occasion, the family together, they’d want to come to Russ & Daughters when they knew they were going to get quality.  So they kept coming.\nOf course, you know, nobody lived around here, and the neighborhood had a bad reputation.  Your car’s going to be broken into, you’re going to get mugged.  Sometimes it was true.  Bad weather.  They weren’t coming here.  \nFor a while we still had the momentum of the Sunday Blue Laws, which in effect made the Lower East Side because the rest of the world had to shut down on Sundays, but there was some special dispensation where the retail shops could be open on the Lower East Side on Sundays, so that you would find big lines waiting to get into the brassiere store, the ladies’ schmatta thing, you know, the fancy clothes.  So there was still vibrancy until those laws were taken off and anybody could be open on a Sunday.  And then the malls came in, where people could drive from their suburban homes to their suburban malls and park their car and have all the shops there.\nSo that was all the death knell for the Lower East Side, and I just sort of—you know, people would say to me, “Mark, why don’t you move your store uptown where your customers are?”\nAnd I said—it was a flip response—“Sooner or later, uptown is going to move downtown,” I said.  I don’t know if I really meant it or why.  We owned the building.  I couldn’t see working to pay a landlord.  That’s sort of another thing you don’t do in this family.  So I didn’t move, and people would come and we would maintain their business.  Little by little, we increased it.  The old Jews that I inherited from my family as customers, suddenly they were leaving.  They weren’t eating it anymore or the salt they weren’t eating, they moved down to Florida, or they went further south and they were in the cemetery.  But then people more my age, you know, that I had more simpatico with, they were coming in, and some of them turned out to be important people in the world, who knew then, you’re waiting on them, you like them, you talk to them, you schmooze.  I like people, basically, and you’ve got to do that to be in this business.  We schmooze.  I knew fish, I learned fish, so I knew good fish and what people’s tastes were.  That was happening.\nSo it was a struggle.  It was a real struggle.  It’s not like a lot of money was being made.  In 1995, we renovated the store, not meaning the whole thing, just the candy side had gotten tired and the floors and the ceilings and the lighting, so we did that.  So I lined up a business consultant and an architect and an engineer and whatever, and I said, “Look, we need this renovated, but you cannot make this look like uptown.  We are downtown, so we’ve got to maintain our old look.  We’ve got to do it in two weeks,” because we only close for two weeks in the summer.  “We’ve got to have it done.”\nThey said, “Of course.”  Of course they’re going to do it, but they charge you five times more.  But we did it, and we did it, I think, the right way, so we maintained the tile concept, the ceiling concept, and we didn’t make it look trendy uptown chic.  It looks like what it’s supposed to look like, what my grandparents want it to look like and my aunts and uncles, clean and neat, and it’s food and it’s going to be clean and fresh and full and filled in all the time.  I think we maintain that.\nSo part of me wanted to do something with the business.  The other part of me had this sense of tradition.  Would they have done it?  I always have to ask myself the question, would my grandparents, my parents have done it this way?  I don’t know.  Things just sort of happen.  People’s tastes change.  They’re going to eat less salty food, so instead of so much belly lox, they’re going to eat Nova Scotia, and suddenly it’s not just Nova Scotia available, it’s salmons from around the world, Scotch salmon, Irish salmon.  So you start bringing those in.  And cream cheese is not just cream cheese anymore; they want tofu cream cheese.  So you do that and you hope that they’re not rolling over in their graves, the Russ family.  But turns out it’s not so bad.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we stop here and then pick it up again.\n\nFederman:  I think I ran out of steam.\n\nQ:  Well, one does.\n\nFederman:  That’s a little monologue I was just in.\n\nQ:  That’s good.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tFederman -  PAGE 46\n\n\n\nInterviewee:  Mark Federman\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Session #2\n\nInterviewer:  Judith Weinraub\t\t\t\t\t           New York City\n\nDate:  January 31, 2011\n\nQ:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is January 31, 2011, and I’m with Mark Federman upstairs and next door from Russ & Daughters.\n\tGood morning.\n\nFederman:  Good morning.\n\nQ:  We got as far as your leaving the law and coming to the store the first time we spoke.  We spoke a little bit about that.  What did you see when you got here?  When you walked into the store and thought about—well, you didn’t think about whether or not you were going to hang in there at first.  Tell me what you saw when you walked in.  I don’t mean visually.\n\nFederman:  Well, I’m not sure I can remember exactly what I saw, but I think an impression was, if not the first day, shortly after that, this wasn’t really what I had in mind.  I’m not sure what I had in mind.  It might have been a more romantic notion of just greeting the customers and being Mr. Russ in front of the store and having everybody happy.  I don’t know, while I lived with this all my life and watched my parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles do this on a daily basis, I don’t know if it ever struck me or I ever understood how difficult this was, and here I was doing it alone.  As soon as I came in, my father exited, for the most part, because he had a bad heart condition.  That was the purpose of this transfer.  My mother was not all that much help.  She was tending to my father.  I think they took off for Pritikin, where they were trying to, I don’t know, turn things around for him.  My aunt and uncle had retired and they had moved to Florida.\nSo I was pretty much alone, although I inherited a staff from them of employees who were not particularly enthusiastic about my arrival on the scene.  One fellow in particular, Sidney, who I describe as a farbisner. \nQ:  What a farbisner?\n\nFederman:  Somebody that’s just dried up and angry.  I suspect that it was his impression that he would take over the business.  He had been there since leaving the army right out of World War II.  He’d come and had been the store manager for some years and I think often he’d let the customers believe that he was a member of the Russ family.  But anyhow, when I showed up, it was probably a surprise to him.  He knew me almost since I’m born, I guess, and he watched as I was probably the most academically successful of the Russ grandchildren, and then I became a lawyer and I was in the army and I practiced law, I had a good position.  So it must have been a shock to him that I showed up and was introduced as the heir apparent to Russ & Daughters.  So he was not going to make my life easy.  It wasn’t his style to make it easy for anybody, not for the fellow employees who he would beat up on verbally.  There was always some issue to his integrity.  The old concept in retail, keep your eyes on the register, is not without justification.\n\nQ:  What does that mean?\n\nFederman:  Keep your eyes on the register?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFederman:  Well, you know, because your help is going to take money from the register.  It’s a cash business.  There were no credit cards in those days that were being used in normal transactions.  So it was a cash business and you had to watch.  Some line I heard from a woman whose father owned a bakery—the woman was eighty-seven; I spoke to her recently—her father owned a bakery two doors to the right, was that her father had a conversation with my grandfather, and she claims that my grandfather had two young guys working for him who had pegged pants.  I said, “What are pegged pants?”  Apparently they were fashionable in that day, 1920 whatever, right?  And her father said to my grandfather, “Russ—.”  They all pronounced Russ as “Roose.”  “Russ, you gotta get rid of those boys.  They’re not going to let you make a living.”  And she claims the story went on, so she obviously heard this from her father, that he also told my grandfather, “Why don’t you bring your daughters into the business,” and my grandfather said to him, “Never.”\nWell, I mentioned this story recently to my mother and my aunt, my aunt being ninety-eight years old, my mother being ninety, and they said that can’t have happened.  First of all, they didn’t know about the kids with the pegged pants, and number two is, it was clear to them that it was expected of them to come into the business from a very early age, so my aunt, the eldest aunt, came in when maybe she was eleven, and maybe her sister came in when she was twelve, started coming on weekends.  They had to go to school.  And my mother says, “And I was lucky, I didn’t have to come in and help out on the weekends till I was fourteen.”\nMy eldest aunt did not finish high school.  At age sixteen she quit, and it was 1929, so the market had crashed.  She went out and had some jobs, but ultimately came back to help her father, and all the daughters came in.\nI don’t know how I got to this point in this monologue.\n\nQ:  That’s okay.  You were talking about Sidney.\n\nFederman:  Me coming into the business.  So the primary characters were Sidney and Louie.  Louie was there to be Sidney’s whipping boy.  I think they hired Louie so that Sidney wouldn’t beat up too much on the customers.  He had a nasty—I mean, when you hear stories of nasty counter men and waiters and the Ratner’s thing, Sidney was like the paradigm for all of this.  He was just nasty.  So when I came in, this nastiness really had a focus.  He would stick a knife in your back, and I wasn’t sure I didn’t have to fear that literally.  There were knives, you know.\nSo Sidney made me miserable and would never really teach me the business, what was going on.  Sidney did everything fast, moves, whatever.  He had that issue.  Fortunately, he had that part of the Russ mantra where you keep everything clean, so there was always a rag and cleaning, whatever.  He made himself look busy and like he knew what he was doing, and wouldn’t share in the secrets like this salad, how was it made, or, you know, anything about the fish.  So I was left with this.\n\nQ:  Who was making the salads?\n\nFederman:  The kitchen crew in the back.  There weren’t that many fancy salads being made.  It was coleslaw, potato salad, chopping herring, whitefish salad.  There wasn’t a lot going on, but whatever it was, it was going to be a mystery that Sidney wasn’t going to let me know about so that, one, he kept his position as being indispensable, the manger of the store, and, two—\n\n[Begin File 2]\n\nFederman:  Where are we?  Are we going in the right direction?\n\nQ:  Yes.  What year was that when you put José and Herman on the—\n\nFederman:  I don’t remember.  It was, I don’t know, four or five years after I came here.  I don’t really remember when that happened, but I never looked back.  They’re fabulous.  They’re really fabulous.  I tell them, “You may have been born a Reyes [phonetic] and a Vargas [phonetic] and [unclear], but you’re Russes.”  Their passion, their ability to work hard, their dedication, their honesty, I’ve never seen anything like those two guys.\nHerman has got the personality, which is just so spectacular, and he also has the ability to double-talk, so that when a customer complains about something, who knows what, Herman is able to just turn that around into a pretzel and they don’t know what happened.  [laughter]  I see them, their eyes glazing over.  “What the hell was the response there?”  But it works, and they keep coming back.  His motivation, both of them, were to please customers, which is essential.  I don’t know if that was the feeling in the generations before, whether it was about pleasing customers.  Certainly you had to please the customer, but these guys would bend over backwards to do it.\n\nQ:  What about your father? \n\nFederman:  My father was like totally charming, totally charming to the customers.  It was a whole other can of worms at home.  And I resented that, because I would see him here, he would spend hours in his little office.  You still haven’t seen the size of that office back there.  He would spend hours there with some customer or other, BS’ing, or a supplier, talking, laughing, smoking cigars, joking around, and I was jealous of the attention, because by the time he got home, he didn’t even want to talk.  He wanted to sit in front of the television, have his dinner served.  He was spent.  So I resented it.\nWhen it came to the kids, he was very volatile.  This is like a shrink session here I’m having with you.  He was very volatile.  But I got this, relating it back to Russ & Daughters, I got this only after I worked here and I understood how you were “on” and had to be “on” here all the time for the suppliers, for the customers, for the staff, so that by the end of the day, you didn’t have anything more to give, so if you went home and your wife wanted to say—or my mother got it, you know.  But, you know, there was trouble with this, the pipe burst, the kids did this.  There was no patience for that.  He had no patience.  And I was constantly on guard in my own life, but when you get tired and stuff, sometimes you slip, but that was the thing that I found distressing.\nMy father was so charming.  Everybody loved my father, Herbie.  Then I got here and I found out its origin.  Well, I mean, there were other origins in his own family.\n\nQ:  What about the product?  Did you change it at all?  Did you keep it the same?\n\nFederman:  Me personally?\n\nQ:  Yes.  How extensive was the product when you came in?\n\nFederman:  There were fewer products, and as more products became available—\n\nQ:  Like what?\n\nFederman:  Okay.  Salmon, for instance.  Salmon was basically belly lox salt-cured salmon, not smoked, real old-fashioned stuff that I still adore at times.  And then the smoked salmon was, by and large, Nova Scotia from the Atlantic Ocean, and then Nova, to distinguish it from the Pacific Ocean, both smokes salmons, both mild cured smoked salmons.\n\nQ:  Which was Pacific?\n\nFederman:  Pacific was the Nova.  But, you know, every appetizing store had a way of calling whatever they had in it.  Some of them called lox anything.  Anything in the store would be called lox.\nInterestingly, it has nothing to do with you, but my daughter Niki had a surprise interview appearance on WNYC just a few days ago.  Do you know this?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nFederman:  Brian Lehrer Show.  You know?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFederman:  So he had as a guest a guy named Ben Zimmer, who took over for William Safire for the “On Language,” the wordsmith guy.  So the segment was about parsing the president’s State of the Union message, he said this and this meant that, blah, blah, blah.  And Brian Lehrer said, “Well, you know, if you ask people, one of the words that sticks in most people’s mind from the speech was ‘salmon.’”  I don’t know if you saw the president’s State of the Union.\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFederman:  He attempted some joke about regulation.  We have regulation when salmon’s out at sea, we have other regulations when the salmon’s up the river, and imagine the regulations when the salmon gets smoked.\n\nQ:  A very Washington kind of joke, but go ahead.  [laughs]  A regulation joke.\n\nFederman:  So Brian Lehrer, taking off on that some days before this particular interview—we’re counting this—he said—and I had said on the air that this is a first, the first time that lox have made its way into the State of the Union message, and then he got a nasty email from one or more of his listeners, who said lox is not smoked salmon.  And he said, “My surprise today—.”  This just happened on Friday.  “I have a surprise.  We’re going to get this straightened out by an expert, Niki from Russ & Daughters in New York.”\nSo he gets Niki on the phone.  Niki apparently had a forty-five-minutes heads-up on this.  “Niki, this is Brian Lehrer.”\n“Hi, Brian.”  Well, anyhow, she was great and relaxed and whatever, and describing the difference between lox as pure salt-cured unsmoked salmon and smoked salmon. \n\nQ:  Let me ask you something.  At that point when you came, was any salmon farmed?\n\nFederman:  No, it wasn’t.  We weren’t selling farmed salmon in those days.  It was wild salmon.\n\nQ:  Certainly on the West Coast and on the East Coast.\n\nFederman:  From both oceans.  It was beginning to get depleted, but still enough of it.  Maybe it was $16 a pound, $4 a quarter, 3.99 a quarter.\n\nQ:  That’s very funny, because my memory from that moment, too, is $4 for a quarter of a pound.\n\nFederman:  Right.  Wild salmon, right?\n\nQ:  I didn’t know it was wild.\n\nFederman:  Farmed salmon really hadn’t entered, or at least we weren’t dealing with farmed salmon for as long as possible.  We didn’t deal with farmed caviar as long as possible, believing that we were the place that was supposed to sell wild fish and fish eggs.  So the salmons were free, basically, and then there was baked salmon also.  Baked salmon is a hot smoked salmon, different processes, too much to go into now.  But that was it.  I mean, the typical smoked fish.  So you had sturgeon, always, and whitefish and chubbs.  Chubbs are disappearing.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you, for the record, explain what chubbs are.\n\nFederman:  Chubbs look like small whitefish.  These are all lake fish, mostly Great Lake fish, and the whitefish roughly two to three pounds.  Sometimes they get up to nine or ten pounds, but basically that’s it.  You serve it at a party, take out the bone, you fillet it, and it’s a whitefish.  It’s a white-flesh meat and fat and rich and quite delicious.\n\tThe chubb is a sort of smaller version of it.  It’s a different species, but people think it’s a baby whitefish, and it’s not.  It’s its own species, but, again, it comes from the same waters, although chubbs, I believe, swim at a different depth than whitefish.  But half the world had, in the past, half the world will claim that chubbs are better to eat and half will claim that whitefish are better, for the same reasons, it’s fatter, sweeter, whatever.  Then the half who are eating whitefish claim it tastes better by the head, the other half by the tail, some by the middle.  You know, we’re Russ & Daughters.  We sell tail, head, chubbs, whitefish, you know.\nWe have a sign—you’ll see it—behind the counter.  It says De Gustibus Non Est Disputandam.  Somebody gave me that sign.  Latin, “Of Taste There is No Dispute.”  Basically, if you like it, it’s the best.  So there’s different tastes for everything.\nBut some of these fish disappeared.  Wild salmon, you know, wild Atlantic salmon has been fished out, and that’s a shame.  We sell Gaspe salmon now.  It’s basically the same Atlantic species with a big fat Nova Scotia, what was called Nova Scotia salmon, Atlantic salmon, came from Nova Scotia, and the best of it came from the Gaspe Peninsula, and that’s what we sold.  So now we have a farm version of the same thing, which tastes very much the same, the Gaspe salmon.\n\nQ:  Then you would have gotten it from somebody who supplied Gaspe salmon, when you came?\n\nFederman:  When I came, the wild fish were bought by the smokers.  Huge amounts was bought by the smokers, and we bought it from the various smokers that we were dealing with.  \nDealing with the smokers is a huge other education I got, was not prepared for when I came in.  I don’t know what I thought when I came in.  I thought it was all going to be easy and romantic and I would be the king of the walk, and I would be doing something meaningful.  \nSo the question is, why did I give up law and come in here?  And I’ve never satisfactorily answered that myself, but I suppose--because I was thinking about this this morning--I suppose I wasn’t that happy practicing law.  I suppose that it wasn’t meaningful for me.  I didn’t find any meaning, although I had various jobs practicing law.  I was in the army doing JAG work, then I was doing that also in Vietnam and stateside.  Then I came back and I worked for Legal Aid Family Court for a period of time, and the concept there was to give kids a fair shake and see if you could help them before they go through the criminal justice system.  It was something fairly new, Juvenile Rights Division.  That turned out to be a disaster, as far as I could tell.  We weren’t really practicing law and weren’t helping any of these kids.  It was an animal show.\nThen they formed something just about that time called the Office of the Special Prosecutor.  I probably told you this.  That was about anti-corruption work that came out of Serpico and the Knapp Commission, and that sounded romantic.  I did that for about five years, and that sort of seemed, after a while, to be fruitless and the romance wore off.\nThen I went to a private firm because now I had a kid and I needed to make some money, so I went to a firm and I wanted to be a litigator and try cases.  But working for a law firm and being on trial all the time wears thin, so when you come home, your head is not really at home.  So anyhow, there may be meaning in law, and I’m sure some lawyers find meaning there, but it didn’t attach itself to me.\nThen I wanted to have an exposure to the world, and it seemed to me law wasn’t doing that.  It really is insular, a lot like medicine.  You’re not really engaged with that much of the world.  In a place like Russ & Daughters, it turns out, more and more so as time goes on, the world comes to you, all of the world, all these different people from all over the world come in and are happy to talk to you and share their stories and find out—you know?\nSo I had those notions in mind that I would fall into this, walk around, strut around the store, be Mr. Russ, and then I realized, you know, you got to get the fish in the store, taken care of, handled, please the customers, keep the help in line, doing the right thing and motivated.  Every moment you had to match up a piece of fish and a counter man and a customer, and you had to get it right because your name, Russ, was on the door.  And then you didn’t have a lot of—at least this is what I felt—didn’t have a lot of room to experiment, because I was dealing with a business that had been here already in ’78, the business, put aside the pushcart phase of this business, officially established in 1914, so this is sixty-four years later.  Is that right?  Yes, we’re moving towards a hundred years.\nSo this is sixty-four years later, history of the way it ran, and then I inherited a staff who knew how it had run and were not interested in changing anything, and a customer base who had largely moved out of the neighborhood, but when they came back, they wanted to make sure that everything was the same as the last time they came, whether it was six days ago or six months ago, whatever.  If you moved the chopped herring from this side of the showcase, they’re like, “What’d you do here?  What’s this kid doing to this store?”  So I inherited that.\nSo what was my view?  I think my view was rather from the beginning.  Okay, then this is placed inside a neighborhood which is in total free-fall.  The Lower East Side was the pits.  The street life was inhabited by pimps and prostitutes and junkies and criminals.  It was like, yeah, it was terrible.  The city had given up services.  It was awful down here.  So whatever romantic notion I had or notions I had were sort of dispelled quickly.\nI wanted to pick up a thread.\n\nQ:  Did you think of moving away from the Lower East Side?\n\nFederman:  Sure.  That was a constant.  My thoughts were existential.  Are we going to continue to exist?  Occasionally I find pieces of paper I put in various places in my house.  I’m big on scribbling things down.  Now with a computer I don’t have paper, but occasionally the computer breaks down and I lose my—so at least with a scratch piece of paper, you know it may be someplace.  You may not uncover it for twenty years.  But I found some scratchy notes, with me.  Question: how long can I keep this going?  Am I the generation that will preside over the failure of Russ & Daughters?  And that was a horrible thought.  So I just was trying not to take over the world with this, but trying to sort of negotiate the icebergs, the shoals and all the stuff I was dealing with.\nSo moving uptown, in fact, customers would come in often and say, “Hey, Mark, why don’t you move your business uptown where your customers are?”  Which made sense.  But the concept, because we owned the business and, in effect, I was paying myself rent, of moving and paying a landlord rent was not one that the Russ family, we weren’t big on that.  And, two, I always had the sense that we were in our historically correct location.  Even if the world changed around us, this is where people know us.  So if they were a Jew from Argentina or France or whatever, any place in the world, California, Chicago, and they wanted to come back to the Lower East Side, they wanted to make sure Russ & Daughters was still here, whether they heard about it or they shopped here once or their parents or grandparents shopped here.  So this was a location for us, and I didn’t know if it would work outside of our current location.\n\nQ:  Who did you see as your competition, if anybody?  What state was Zabar’s in at that point?\n\nFederman:  Zabar’s is great.  Zabar’s is the only one I paid attention to, because Zabar’s represented what had become a huge business, big family, huge business, and I don’t do envy very often, but Zabar’s I was envious of, past tense.  I was envious of.  The reason it’s past tense—oh, and part of what I was doing also is trying to negotiate and exist, I felt very strongly that I spend time with my family.  By now I had two young kids, and I didn’t have enough of my parents’ attention.  My mother worked on weekends, left us with a terrible grandmother, my father’s mother.  So, you know, we all try to learn from the mistakes we think our parents made.  Then we make our own new mistakes.  Some of theirs and our own, we create our own.\nSo where was I now?\n\nQ:  Zabar’s.\n\nFederman:  Oh, yes, Zabar’s.  Okay.  That was the one thing I was envious of because I would hear about Zabar’s buying this much fish, was taking this much money, and I always figure I’m as smart as anybody else, not necessarily smarter, but as smart, so I felt somewhat envious of that.  From time to time I would run into one of the Zabars in the smokehouses.  I would be picking out fish.  Then I was running into, more often than the others, David Zabar, who’s the son of one of the brothers, Stanley or Saul. David was new in the business, was somewhat younger than I, and we would talk.  I would tell him whatever we would talk about, I was going here with my family, going on a ski trip, whatever, blah, blah, blah.\n\tSo, some years later there was an article in maybe the New York Magazine about Zabar’s and how it was explosive and the family was fighting, and David would say, while they were interviewing him, and he was pissed off that his family wanted him to work a hundred hours a week and he wasn’t going to take it, blah, blah, blah, typical next-generation, “Why I have to work this hard?”  And he said, “And I have this friend and we meet each other in the smokehouses, and he runs this kind of business and he’s with his family and he’s not working a hundred hours.”  [laughs]  So the irony is that here’s this guy who I envied with the volume of his business, and it turns out he’s envying me for my lifestyle.  So that was the last time I think I envied anybody for anything.  You know, it took me a while to realize we run very different kinds of businesses.\nWhen I came in, also the food world was changing.  The concept of the little Mom and Pop, Edsel, Pedsel and Company business, foods, specialty foods business, was going by the boards.  I mean, in every community you’d see it.  First of all, the communities were changing.  The Italian community little or no longer existed.  So the little bakeries and little [unclear] and whatever, and the Jewish neighborhood of the Lower East Side, you know, that had disappeared, so the delis were going.  The appetizing stores, I think there was maybe two or three or four left here when I first got here, or five, when I first got here, when there were twenty or thirty of them, you know, in its heyday here.  Now we’re the only one that exists here, and maybe one of the few—you can count them on one hand—that exist in the city at all.\nSo the concept of this specialty food business, Mom and Pop family thing was disappearing, and food was going to one-stop shopping and it was getting fancy, so you had not only Zabar’s, you had Balducci’s.  Even the supermarket world was trying to get fancy, with the Food Emporiums.  Then sometimes they got places that got too fancy.  Dino De Laurentiis—I forget which year that was—decided to make some extravaganza on the Upper West Side with whatever he called it, Food Halls.  I forget what he called it.  Food Works, something.  And that didn’t last.  But nonetheless, it was about big one-stop shopping.  That was going on.  There was no economy of scale in doing what we did.  It didn’t make sense as a business model anymore.  The neighborhood was changing.\n\nQ:  Did you deliver?\n\nFederman:  No, we didn’t.  I tried delivering for a while.  It turned out to be a disaster, because you had to send two people to get around the city.  You sent one, you got a ticket.  Then you lost them for hours.  You didn’t know if they truly got stuck in traffic.  There were no cell phones in those days where you could check on a guy.  And it just didn’t really make any sense.\nOf course, if it was a big order, we’d wind up delivering it ourselves.  I remember some guy showed up, one of the first Christmases.  It was some kind of actor, some kind of famous actor.  I don’t remember his name, or semi famous.  He wanted to give little one-pound boxes of chocolate candies to I don’t know how many people, fifty, a hundred, whatever, and he wanted them delivered during Christmas.  So my wife took one of the guys from the kitchen, and we packed them in little stupid white boxes, tried to wrap them.  I mean, we learned, by doing it ourselves, so many things.  We learned the hard way.  Mostly my parents, we inherited what they did, so I suppose here and there they made things a little better, and I think here and there we made some things better and easier.\n\nQ:  So if you didn’t deliver, that means people had to come here.\n\nFederman:  People had to come here.  That’s right.  Shipping is another issue.  Shipping is a big part of our business.  Didn’t exist then.  Here’s what I inherited.  My father and uncle, particularly my uncle was very conservative about this, my father was more trusting and wanted to build up the business, my uncle was very conservative, so if somebody, for instance, an important person from Hollywood wanted five pounds of sturgeon for a party, here’s how it went.  He would say, “Send me a check.  Here’s how much it’ll cost you.  Send me a check.  When it clears, I’ll send you the merchandise.”  [laughter]  \nThere were no credit cards in those days, and there wasn’t really overnight shipping, so they’d have to pack it in dry ice.  To pack something in dry ice, you had to get a delivery of a big thing.  We didn’t use dry ice particularly.  So you’d get this big thing of ice, you’d chip it away, you’d put it in there with the smoke going over, and then you had to make out paperwork for the airlines.  They weren’t happy to have this thing change the cabin pressure and stuff.  It was a nightmare, so we really didn’t do it.  We discouraged it from happening.  That was shipping.\n\tThen credit cards came in, so I beefed up the shipping business, because now you had a credit card.  Then you had overnight shipping, FedEx.  So it’s not like I was brilliant.  I mean, things changed in the world.  The food world changed, the shipping portion of it changed, the way business is done has changed.\nSo in 2000, my daughter Niki, who you know, 2000, 2001, she graduated college in ’99.  I forget when.  She graduated Amherst College, hot shot, very smart, lovely girl, and decided she was going to go West to San Francisco.  That seemed to be the pattern of the kids that graduated college.  If you graduated on the East Coast, you go and get a job on the West Coast, vice versa.  So Niki decided she was going to go West, and so, you know, the Jewish father, “What are you going there for?  Where are you going to stay?”  Whatever. \nAs it turns out, I met a customer in the store, a friend of Calvin Trillin’s.  He brought her in once and then she came in herself, and it turns out she’s from San Francisco, she heard Niki was going out there.  She offered her house to Niki so Niki could stay and get situated.  That’s what happens in Russ & Daughters, you know.\nNiki went there and became an assistant to the director or the assistant to the director of the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco, David somebody, whose name I don’t remember.  I think it took her about a year and a half to figure out that she wasn’t going to be the director, you know.  She was just an assistant.  But Niki’s an ambitious kid from New York.\nSo anyhow, she decided she was going to come back East, much to my delight, but she was going to come back East to work for a not-for-profit.  You notice the way I said that.  Not for profit.  I said, “Niki, we’re the Russ family.  We do for-profit only.”  Of course, my saying that was like the kiss of death on my own fantasy.  So Niki heard that from me, she was going to do this job for sure.  It was some, at that point, some creation, combination of the U.N. and Cisco Systems, the big computer—and they were going to solve all of the world’s problems on the computer.  They were going to get donations [unclear].  Niki was all fired up about this.  It lasted for her about five months.  She realized she was sitting in front of a computer screen, and that wasn’t very intriguing to her, and maybe for the same reasons that being a lawyer wasn’t all that intriguing to me.  Somehow it didn’t work.\nSo she left there, and we had given her an apartment here in the building.  It wasn’t this size; it was a studio.  So she was trying to figure out her next move, when 9/11 happened.  Actually, on 9/11, if you walk to the top of this building, we had then a spectacular view of the back of the building this way, on the top, of the World Trade Center towers.  It was like right in your face.  So when we understood what was going on, Niki and I went up to the top and watched the towers burn and smoke and fall down.  At some point, Niki said to me, “Dad, I think people are jumping out of the windows.” \nAnd I said, “No, Niki, it must be debris.”  But it turns out people were jumping out of the windows.\n\nQ:  Because it was early in the morning, so she still would have been here.  She probably wouldn’t have gone to work yet.\n\nFederman:  She was here living in the building, right.  But I guess the point I wanted to make was not that, but 9/11 changed the dynamic.  Certainly in a moment’s notice there were no jobs available, and she hadn’t figured out her next move.  I thought 9/11, for all its horrors, in a sense worked for me because now Niki would be here, realize that she was the heir apparent of Russ & Daughters.  My son always wanted to be a doctor and became a doctor, you know, and is happy being a doctor and is good at it and is doing good work.\n\nQ:  Where is he?\n\nFederman:  He’s at UCLA and he does pediatric oncology, so he’s not in it for the money, but he’s got a reputation for being a good doctor, which is terrific.  I often say I’m the only Jewish father who didn’t want a son to be a doctor.  I wanted him to be here.  Part of the irony we can get back to is now that I’m here, I want my kids to do this because I think this is good work.\n\tAt any rate, so Niki and her mother decided that Niki would be here till she figured it out, doing special projects.  I maybe mentioned this to you?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nFederman:  Here’s where we’re not on the same page.  I’m seeing Niki as the heir apparent, so I’m going to teach her the way the Russes learned to run this business.  You stand on the counter six days a week, ten hours a day.  That’s just on the counter.  You go home, you do the books, whatever, and you go to the smokehouse several times a week and you buy the fish, then you slice fish, you handle the fish, you tell people what to do.  First you learn how to do it right, blah, blah, blah.  So that’s my vision of this thing.\n\tNiki’s vision and her mother’s vision, my wife, is that Niki will be doing special projects.  I’m saying, “What’s a special project?  This is Russ & Daughters.  What could a special project do?”  A special project, to me, is somebody calls up a restaurant, says, “I need a hundred schmaltz herrings filleted in an hour.”  That’s a special project.  But they’re talking about the Internet, and I don’t know from this stuff.  I do have a computer in the store at this point.\n\nQ:  This point being about when?\n\nFederman:  2001.  Actually, I think I also have closed-circuit TV so I could see from the office to the front, what’s happening.  I have it focused on the register and on the customer thing.  So that’s how I got high tech.  That was about it.  But this Internet business, I’m clear it’s a business, but I don’t know about it.  You want to place an order, you’re in the store or you’re calling me and I know your voice.  Then I let you place an order.\nBut they’re determined, special projects, and my wife comes from a different culture.  She’s from South America society there, and shopkeepers are not held in high repute.  So she doesn’t want this for her daughter.  Plus she knows—now, my wife has been doing—when the kids were old enough and went to school and she had some free time, I started sort of getting my wife involved here, so she would do the books, she would do some of the candy buying, she would run around, do the yeoman’s work.  She tried to stay off the counter, where she never felt comfortable dealing with the public.  But, you know, there was always that sense that this place didn’t comport with her background, that she didn’t see her daughter, who is lovely, delightful, smart, doing this.  Our daughter should be president of the world, not running a little smoked fish outfit.\n\nQ:  Did she have issues with your coming back here, Maria?\n\nFederman:  No, she didn’t, or if she did, she didn’t say so.  I don’t know how much thought we gave to it.  We may have talked about it.  I suspect we did.  We may have had the same romantic notion that it’ll be easier than what I was doing, because I was on trial a lot of the time, and that means constantly your head is someplace else.  It’s an adversarial system in law, and your job is to basically beat the guy in court the next day.\nSo that wasn’t making me happy and I wasn’t able to pay attention to her.  Little did I know that I would come home thinking about whether whitefish are going to be available for Mrs. Goldberg and if it would be filleted right by José the next day.  But, you know, if you’re a worrier, you’re going to worry.  But I think what we both sort of felt was that what I was doing was not making me happy, therefore it wasn’t going to make her happy, and maybe I would have more time to play with the family and be home, whatever notions we had that turned out not to be true.\nSo at any rate, she was going to save her daughter from this, so now my wife is here and she sees how hard this is.  There are no storekeepers in her background.  There are judges and lawyers and senators and governors, right?  This is not like fish salesmen.  So God forbid her daughter does it.  So she’s going to protect her daughter.\nAnd I’m busy downstairs, happy, “Hey, everybody, meet my daughter Niki.  See how pretty she is, how smart she is?  She’s going to take over.”  Niki didn’t want to be my daughter.  She didn’t want to be anybody’s daughter.  She wanted to be her own person.  So I think I mentioned that she exited here after a few years, and my nephew came in.\nGetting back now, jumping around, getting back, you know, the neighborhood spiraled down and the issue was moving uptown, where the customers were, because, you know, they didn’t really want to come down here.  At some point a few years after I got here, really the stores that were draws down here stopped being draws because the malls were developed in the suburbs.\n\nQ:  You mean the Lower East Side stores, clothing stores, that kind of thing?\n\nFederman:  Yes.  I remember in the sixties and into the seventies, you walked down Orchard Street and there were some stores that always had lines.  I saw people waiting to get in to buy the schmattas that were designer or whatever they were.  They weren’t even dressing rooms.  Women were dropping their clothes and trying on these things.  Friedlich’s was one. I forget.\n\nQ:  You know what I used to do occasionally?  I would come down to the fancy fabric stores.  There were places that sold Italian fabric or something, so if you wanted a yard to make a miniskirt, you could do that.  [laughter]\n\nFederman:  That’s right.  Lots of fabric stores and things, woolens and stuff.  Then there were leathergoods stores and there were fur places, schmatta places and whatever.  But that started to disappear quickly also as the malls developed, as the department stores started to offer sales and they could compete with the Lower East Side, as it became more of a hassle to come down here, no place to park, it’s dirty, they’re going to break into your car.  The Sunday Blue Laws were a big part of keeping the economy going down here, because you couldn’t shop anyplace on a Sunday other than Lower East Side.  So people came in.  While they were doing here buying a schmatta or whatever, they’d come to Russ & Daughters while having their pillow stuffed.\n\nQ:  You never worried about having enough people coming here?\n\nFederman:  Always.  To this day.  Not really to this day, because the neighborhood has changed.  Yes, that was the existential worry.  Are there going to be people?  What happens on those days when I have more help than I do customers?  And some of the customers come in and they want an eighth of a pound and a long conversation with the owner.  That’s me.  I mean, it was dreadful.  And others came in and they were doing you a favor.  They came from uptown.  They’re used to having your mother or father or aunt and uncle wait on you, and here you were.  If they were older, they saw me as a kid.  They’re like one step out of the Lower East Side, but all of a sudden, you know, their noses were in the air.  Their husbands had made it in the schmatta business or something.  Then they come back, so they’re doing you a favor and they’d let you know that.  It was awful.\nWhy did I keep doing it?  Because I didn’t want to be the Russ to take it down the drain.  When people knew Russ & Daughters, they knew it and they smiled.  “Oh, yeah, Russ & Daughters ,” blah, blah, blah.  I just didn’t want to preside over the death of Russ & Daughters.\n\nQ:  Did you ever think of enlarging the product line?\n\nFederman:  And I did.\n\nQ:  How did you do that?\n\nFederman:  With a great deal of slowness and trepidation.  There was still my mother in the background.  My father had died two years after I came in.  They’d been in the background.  So we decided, so what do you do when you’re worried about you don’t have enough customers, and is anybody really interested in your product anymore, because your natural customer base is an older affluent Jew, because stuff is starting to get more expensive, older affluent Jewish person who was going to serve it—it’s not a daily thing you’re going to eat.  Maybe you’ll have a bagel and lox or when the family comes home and the son, who’s the doctor, is going to come back with the machatunim to show, you want to have it, but otherwise, they weren’t eating it regularly.  They were going low on salt or they moved to Florida or they were dead or whatever.  So who’s interested?  Was I selling the right things?  What do you do here?\n\nQ:  So what did you do?\n\nFederman:  Well, you know, you start changing some things.  You listen to the customers and what is it that they want.  What is it that they don’t want?  What is a natural thing to do?  One of the big things was for me to grow the caviar business, because it was a natural.  We had the connections for it.  We always sold some caviar, only not a large amount.  And so for some reason, perhaps ego, and I’m looking around seeing the other people selling caviar in this town, I figure—you know.  It took years because you have to develop a palette and be in a position to buy it, and who to buy what from, because in those days, it was like the Wild West in caviar.  Especially after the Soviet Union fell, everything went crazy.\n\nQ:  What about the olive oils and jams and things like that?\n\nFederman:  We always had that stuff, and we still have it.\n\nQ:  Some of it or a little?\n\nFederman:  We always had some.  My grandfather had the store and then his daughters, in the beginning.  There’s a picture there.  The ceilings were higher.  Ultimately the ceilings were dropped.  They were higher and they were floor-to-ceiling shelving with canned goods, sardines, salmon, tuna, sprats, that kind of stuff, and there was a market for it, particularly during World War II when the stuff was rationed.  Then Russ & Daughters seemed to be doing well because they figured out how to get a supply of this stuff, and they had a little warehouse on Ludlow Street, so during the war, people would come and they would be directed, hush-hush, in their cars over to Ludlow Street, and the trunks would be open and the cases would be put in the trunk.\nSo I think that’s when Russ & Daughters finally got to do some business and do better.  But it was canned goods, and people ate canned goods in those days.  Who eats canned goods anymore?  A can of salmon.  Nobody eats a can of salmon.  Now I have special salmon, you buy a little can of salmon, it’s like ten dollars.  It’s delicious, but it’s ten dollars.  And I don’t know if you remember the oval cans of salmon, oval shape.  You’re too young.  Oval-shaped salmon.  It was called a steak salmon.  The spring catch was considered better, and various producers.  Quite delicious.  I was able to get that myself, the last of it, from a producer in Oregon, and I sort of controlled the East Coast market.  It was expensive.\nI’m just remembering an anecdote.  A few days after 9/11, I got a call from one of our customers, Sam LeFrak.  He had built Battery Park City and a lot of other things.  Sam was an old customer at this point, in his eighties.  So he called.  Maybe this is not even a week after 9/11.  “Mark, I need my salmon.”  He was buying these by the case.  It was only the old Jews who were buying this stuff.  “I need my salmon.”\n“I don’t have it, Sam.”\n“What do you mean, you don’t have it?”  He started to yell at me, screaming.\nI said, “What are you yelling at me for?  Do you know what just happened?”\nHe said, “Do I know what happened.  You know, I just lost everything I have in Battery Park City.  Who else can I yell at?”  He felt comfortable yelling at me because I couldn’t get his salmon.\nBut the old Jews would eat canned goods.  The old Jews would suck on hard candies.  I mean, who does that stuff anymore?  We were selling canned goods and hard candies.  So that had to change, but there was a reluctance on my part, fearing that if I changed something, like move the chopped herring from one side of the showcase to the other, the customers would abandon me.  They would say, “What is this upstart doing here?”  You know?  The business ran for so many years, you know.  “What’s he changing what his parents and aunts and uncles and grandparents did?”  So that was that fear that I always carried around about change.\nSo one of the things we did was bring in coffee.  See, my wife was a bit motivating in this, because she didn’t have—\n\n[Begin File 3]\n\nFederman:  Where was I?\n\nQ:  Coffee.\n\nFederman:  Coffee.  My wife.  I’m blessed that my wife, for whatever she thought about this place, she did the work.  She absolutely did the yeoman’s work, never wanted any part of the spotlight of this thing because she’s not really a people person, but also she wasn’t emotionally attached to it like I was.  She didn’t have these ancestors calling out from the grave, “Don’t touch that.  Don’t move that,” whatever.  “What are you doing?”  Right?  So she was always, “We have to renovate.  We have to do something.”\n\tSo for some reason we decided to bring in coffee barrels.  We put in the coffee and we grind coffee.  We never sold coffee in this store.  We made coffee for the help to drink and the Russ family drank coffee.  So we brought in a line of coffee and it was fine.  People bought it.  It didn’t take over the world, but I think the most important thing about bringing coffee was that we had a sense that, okay, maybe lightning wouldn’t strike us.\nSo then little by little, there were things that had to be changed.  Enough people started to ask for the cream cheese substitute.  “Why don’t you bring in this tofu cream cheese they have?”  And I’m thinking my grandfather—there’s a big portrait of my grandfather handing over the candies.  I said, “That’s going to fall down if I do it.”  But, you know, enough people ask and you bring it in, and then more and more people are buying it.\n\nQ:  What does it taste like?\n\nFederman:  It’s not bad, actually.  It’s not bad at all.  If you’re lactose-intolerant or you don’t want to eat real cream cheese, sometimes I do, you know?  Especially if you mix it with vegetables or scallion or something.\nSo from that, you start changing a little bit here, a little bit there.  At some point, in 1995, at my wife’s prodding, we renovated at least the candy side of the store, the candy side and the floors and the ceiling, whatever.  By this point I had put in a new showcase because the old one had died.\n\nQ:  Was old, yes.  [laughs]\n\nFederman:  Really old and had died.  I was worried about when I ripped that out, what I was going to find underneath, whether I’d have to put in a new sub-floor and floor, whatever, but it turns out my grandfather’s concept was, you do it once, you do it right.  So there’s like four inches of concrete under there.  So we put in a showcase.  That was early on.\n\nQ:  It is a lot more candy than it used to be?\n\nFederman:  We had the window, and the window is still pretty much the way it was, where we had dried fruits.  Dried fruits, I don’t know where this came from, but dried fruits is a favorite for Jews, if nothing else, it keep them regular with the prunes, whatever.\n\nQ:  It’s delicious.\n\nFederman:  Also a favorite dessert is fruit compote.  They stew it up and they have dessert, and everybody likes that.  So the store had this nice display of maybe five different dried fruits, prunes, two different kinds, big prunes, too, the sweet big California prune.  My finger’s like three inches, right?  And then there was a big fat sour prune from Oregon.  Some people preferred the sour—I did—that tart taste.\nThen there were apricots.  In those days, the apricots were this Turkish apricot, that was this California Blenheim, also big and tart and soft and fabulous, and pears and peaches and apples.  That was pretty much it, five or six different items in long trays in the window, and people would walk by and look in, say, “Oh, yeah, I need some dried fruit.”  It would be a draw.\nOver the dried fruit we had hanging down strings of Polish mushroom.  It seems rather arcane, but in the turn of the last century and going forward, it was very much a staple for Eastern Europeans to have dried mushrooms.  As I understand it, the reason was ,you couldn’t afford to buy meat.  This is such an earthy, deep rich taste, that it substituted for meat in soups or in sauce or whatever.  So my grandfather, rather early on, billed himself as an importer of these dried Polish mushrooms.  I don’t think he imported them himself, but he bought them from another importer here.  But I saw a reverse directory in 1929, so it was on the t0p billing, two different listings.  The top billing was J. Russ Imported Mushrooms and the next one was J. Russ Appetizers.  So he fancied himself a mushroom guy, and a mushroom was a staple.  Now a pound of mushrooms is someplace between $150 and $175 a pound.  They’re hard to get and not that many people eat them or know what to do with them, but they’re fabulous, sort of that rich deep mother-earth truffle-y thing going on.\nSo the candy side had that and it had these mushroom things hanging down, and then against the back wall it had these candy bins.  Maybe there were twenty of them.  Each one had individual wrapped hard candy, which was common, but less and less were people buying hard candies.  You know anybody who has hard candies in their pocket anymore?  No, but every first-generation Jew always had a hard candy or several hard candies in their pockets.  They would eat it themselves or they would give it out as gifts, hand out hard candies to their grandchildren, nieces, whatever.  It’s a treat.  But that stopped happening, so that had to go.\nIn the front of the counter, I’m picturing this again.  Off to the side we had these glace fruits, really sticky.  I’m not quite sure why people bought them.  They were pretty to put out, serve, but it was sticky.  Then we had other things that we don’t have anymore, like candied kumquats, also sticky, and ginger.\nThen we had two showcases in the front, candy showcases.  One had a lot of nuts, individual nut things, but they were wood and they were open, and that meant in the summertime you’d get these bug-y things going on.\n\nQ:  There’s a lot of chocolate now.\n\nFederman:  Well, we had chocolate then, not when I was a kid.  When I was a kid working in the store, from age thirteen you had to come in on the weekend on a rotating basis.  That was part of the deal of being a Russ.  You didn’t want to, but they needed help.  It was only the candy side, and they paid you very well.  It was like a dollar an hour or 1.10 an hour.  So a ten-hour day, you made like eleven dollars.  You were rich.  That’s a lot of baseball cards, whatever you’re going to buy, right?  In those days, a movie was 25 cents, a slice of pizza was 10, 25 cents.  I forget what it was, or a hot dog.\n\tSo they had chocolates.  When I was a kid working there, the chocolates were basically twists, the chocolate-covered marshmallow twists, but the twists were different in those days because they would freeze.  So you’d put them in the freezer and then you’d have this frozen chocolate-covered marshmallow thing which they thought was a treat.\n\nQ:  It sounds fabulous.\n\nFederman:  It was okay.  Then they had little squares of chocolate-covered halvah. They’re not made anymore. Now they’re wrapped.  Those were little, better.  Then there were these marmalade bars that were two colors.  They were like red and orange and either had sugar and then like a white layer in between, and had either crystallized sugar on the outside or sprinkles, chocolate sprinkles.  I mean, to this day people show up every six months and will say, “Where’s the marmalade bar?”  Or they’re on a mission for themselves or for some aged parent or grandparent, you know.  You want to be remembered in the will, find me this thing I used to get at Russ & Daughters.  And they’d show up and ask for it.  So that’s when I was a kid.\n\tThen also I remember big barrels.  One was of peanuts in a big stainless-steel barrel, and they had these peanuts there, fresh roasted peanuts.  The problem is, the customers would just take them while they were waiting, and it’d be all over the floor.  The other one was a big barrel full of buxa.  You know what buxa is?\n\nQ:  No.\n\nFederman:  Buxa is dried carob, and I don’t know how the Jews got into buxa.  They love buxa.  Also buxa turns out to be one of nature’s great natural laxatives.  But you bite this thing, it was really hard, and you’d make sure not to eat the little seedy thing in there, and it had that carob-y taste, which became something of a chocolate substitute when you sweetened it.  But it had a very weird sort of funky taste to it, but then there were the classic customers who just had to have it.  So that’s what I’m remembering.\n\tIn chocolates, maybe we had also rum cordials, coffee beans.  I think that was pretty much it.  Someplace along the line, they found a line of hand-dipped chocolates, which were truly hand-dipped from a little lady [Sheila Kaye] in Brooklyn who was doing it, and she was making wonderful hand-dipped chocolates.  So then they had a display of chocolate-covered pineapple cores and prune and apricot and orange peel and chocolate-covered ginger, and then marshmallows of different kind.  The best was like a maple marshmallow chocolate-covered hand-dipped with a line of caramel.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nFederman:  Right.  Exactly.  So there was this whole line, and then there was this one I didn’t like but a lot of people did, honeycomb.  What is that stuff?  Honeycomb, chocolate covered.  It was awful, but people liked it.  So they had this line of hand-dipped chocolates.  So we got in the chocolate business.\n\tWell, someplace along the line, Nassau Candy took over the business, the lady sold out, she got older, sold out to some big candy company, who then commercialized it, and that wasn’t so good anymore.  But now my daughter and nephew have discovered some small companies making sort of artisanal little chocolates that are quite wonderful, much more expensive, but quite wonderful.  So they like to buy things that are small family-company artisanal stuff and try to sell that.\n\nQ:  All of this is way fattening.  That hasn’t affected the people who want to buy it?\n\nFederman:  When you’re in this store, you’re not going to be wanting to think about fattening or salt.  There’s no reason to be in the store, Russ & Daughters, if that’s what your thinking is.  It’s just the way it is.  I tried at one point, when I realized that, to dabble in different products, so every year we’d go to Fancy Foods Show.  You’ve been in the Fancy Food Center, right?\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFederman:  You know what that’s—\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nFederman:  As a kid, I would occasionally get taken by my father to the Fancy Foods Show, which was then the Candy and Confection Show in the Columbus Circle, whatever was there at the time.  I’m talking about a long time ago.  That was very exciting for a kid, and then you could have samples of stuff, and the suppliers would recognize my father as Russ & Daughters, and they would schmooze him up and give me candies and pencils with the name on it.  So it’s part of the romantic notion I carried forward.\n\tNow we go to the Fancy Foods Show, International Fancy Foods Show in the Javits Center, it’s like that on steroids.  It’s extraordinary.  But it’s always with an eye towards finding new products.  Most often, you know, it’s finding the same products repackaged, so it gets a little old, but still I walk around and say hello to the vendors, and people, “Oh, Russ & Daughters,” blah, blah, blah, you know.\n\tI remember once finding a sugar-free halvah, and I decided that this may be an oxymoron, but I had to try it.  The Jews were then realizing they were all diabetic.  Remind me, the story about my recollection about James Beard.  At any rate, so I tried to bring this stuff in, and no Jew was going to buy that.  It was awful, dry, straw-y tasting, like whatever.\nThe James Beard this is, I didn’t know James Beard.  I think my parents had dealt with him several times in the store, or often, but by the time I came in here, I was dealing with Clay, who was his houseman, assistant, whatever, sort of a heavyset guy.  Clay would come in and buy for James Beard.  Sturgeon he loved, and chocolates.  It turns out that he was not allowed to eat, by his doctors, either salt products or sweets, but he kept the candies, I understood from Clay, under the bed, and the sturgeon he just ate right away.\nI remember after he died, Clay was floating around.  I would see him floating around on the Lower East Side, never came in after that.  That was the James Beard story.\n\nQ:  So he never came in, actually?\n\nFederman:  James Beard?  He did, but before my time.  Not when I was there.  They had their share of foodies.  Mimi Sheraton would come in, still does.  Calvin Trillin still does.  People come in and they get a sort of proprietary interest in Russ & Daughters, and it becomes something more than a commercial transaction.  You always have to give them the good product.  That’s without a doubt.  But they have a special attachment to it.\n\nQ:  When did you online business start to grow?\n\nFederman:  Well, so Niki, over my objection, developed this website, and she got her friends to do the—I don’t know even what they call it.  I mean, I just like opted out of this.\n\nQ:  Why was it over your objections?\n\nFederman:  Because we had never done business like that.  It was like too sort of futuristic for me.  I didn’t understand it.  My head wasn’t wrapping around it very well.\n\nQ:  This was how long ago?\n\nFederman:  2001.  I didn’t understand it and I didn’t want to deal with it.  I didn’t know if it would take off.  I didn’t know if it would crash everything around, we’d send a bad piece of something to somebody and it would bring down everything.  I just didn’t understand it, didn’t know it, didn’t want it, didn’t want the headache of it.  But it turns out by now to be a substantial portion of our business.\n\nQ:  How substantial?\n\nFederman:  I don’t know what the figures are, but I would imagine 20 percent of our business is online.\n\nQ:  And somebody packs it from here?\n\nFederman:  It’s all done here.  We built a whole new shipping department down in the basement, but that was largely because I got a contract for—I don’t know if it was a year or two, maybe it was one year, yes, one year and I gave it up, with Neiman-Marcus.  They wanted a package from us, a bagels and lox package.  I agreed to do it, but I realized I couldn’t deal with the volume, so I built a whole shipping, packing department in the basement.  Of course, we had a lot of product going out, but it was stupid.  We made no money.  I don’t know if we lost money on that thing.  They weren’t going to buy for a lot of money.  They were going to sell it for a lot of money, but they weren’t going to buy it for a lot of money.  So they billed it in their catalog, Russ & Daughters, the famous New York emporium, the best smoked fish, blah, blah, blah, with lox and [unclear], and it was just a lot of work.  We hand-sliced everything.  It was stupid.\n\tBut anyhow, as a result of that, the good thing that happened is that I built out this portion and another walk-in, so now we’re able to fulfill—everything is done here.  Again, this is not the kind of business you would choose, because you have to slice salmon a certain way, you have to pack it, it’s perishable, it costs us a lot of money.  It’s not your favorite kind of business.\n\nQ:  You said the best smoked-fish business.  That’s a major reputation to live up to.  How did you do that?\n\nFederman:  I’m not following the question.\n\nQ:  There are other people that sell smoked fish.  How do you keep this the best?\n\nFederman:  First of all, you have to be fearful.\n\nQ:  I see.  [laughter]\n\nFederman:  And you have to be egotistical.  You’re asking me questions I haven’t thought about.\n\nQ:  Do you remember I went with you to a smoked—whatever you call it, smokeree or whatever, smokehouse at one point, and I remember the floor was wet, but they obviously save you the good stuff, get you the good stuff?  How does that work?  You buy the good stuff, I guess.\n\nFederman:  Yes, we have to know what the good stuff is.  Part of it is learning a good piece of fish from a bad piece of fish, and that’s a process.  So, I mean, the story is that I asked my father, one of the first days I came in, I’m all puffed up, I’m a lawyer, I’m more educated than any member of my family before me—\n\nQ:  What you really need is boots to go to the smokehouse.  [laughter]\n\nFederman:  Who knew, right?  Okay.  I figure I’m going to learn it with one lesson.  “Teach me a good piece of fish from a bad piece of fish.”\n\tHe said, “We’ll go to the smokehouse and we’ll look at this and we’ll taste this and we’ll do this and we’ll bring it back to the store and we’ll—,” da-da-da-da.  And a whole litany of things.  And he said, “Okay.”\n\tI said, “That’s it?”\n\tHe said, “Yeah.  And then maybe after ten years you’ll know a good piece of fish from a bad piece of fish.”  So it’s this constant handling and whatever.  I figure I’m smarter than the rest of the Russes.  It took me maybe five years, and maybe it took me a little less to teach my nephew and my daughter that kind of thing.\nBut it basically is handling the product and tasting and whatever.  You can’t taste everything, so some of it you’ve got to know by feel.  You have to engage a lot of senses in doing this.  So that’s what we consider a bit of the art form of this thing, knowing good from bad.  You can’t decimate a good piece of fish because you want too—you can’t break it open and eat it, because the smoker’s not going to let you do it.\n\nQ:  But you also have to have the cooperation of the smoker, yes, to either save you the good things—\n\nFederman:  To get that.  Right.  To get that, you need to know what you’re doing, because if they sense that you don’t, they’ll—you know.  So you need to know what you’re doing, hopefully.  You need to buy in large volume.  They’re not going to mess around with a guy—everybody’s got a piece of lox in their showcase, but you’ve got to be buying hundreds of pieces of lox at a time.  And you’ve got to pay your bills.  They’re all from the old school, you know, they’ve inherited the same thing we did, so we pay their bills right away.  Hopefully after a while I knew what I was doing, and we sell a lot of fish, enough so that we could buy from lots of different places.  You don’t want to bury yourself with one smoker.  So this guy doesn’t have it today, maybe the other guy has it, and whatever.  Maybe his [unclear] are not so good, whatever, or the other guy burnt his whitefish and this guy didn’t today or tomorrow, whatever.\nSo it’s a lot of headaches and it’s all very expensive stuff, and you’ve got to remember, the smokers are buying huge quantities of fish.  They’re not buying a box of fish here.  They buy thousands of pounds of fish and smoking up hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds at a time, and not all of that is great fish, and yet they all look alike.\n\nQ:  So how do you learn?\n\nFederman:  So then you learn, right?  How do you distinguish, when you’re looking at two pieces of salmon that look pretty much the same, how do you determine which is the salmon that you want to sell in the store because the person who’s going to buy it is going to serve it to her whoever.  Her rabbi’s coming over for dinner or something, right?  So it’s about the buying, the knowing, the connections, whatever.\n\tBut this point, the fourth generation, my daughter and nephew, are dealing with some of the smokehouses of four generations also, so by this point there’s a connection and we are big-volume users of fish, so they want to please us.  Still, we’re very finicky because that’s what you inherit from my grandfather, is this demand for quality and cleanliness and whatever, you know.\n\nQ:  If you were to go into Zabar’s or somewhere else, can you tell the difference between what they’re selling and what you’re selling, or is there much difference or less volume?\n\nFederman:  No, no, no, no.  He’s got big volume and he has good fish.  You know, I wouldn’t downplay some of these places.  They have the ability to buy good fish.  There’s only a certain number of places that sell it, so hopefully if he’s on top of his game and he knows what he’s doing, he’s buying the right fish from that big batch of fish, and I’m buying the right piece of fish.  I like to say this is our specialty.  We’re not diffused by pots and pans or whatever.  But that’s not to say that you can’t get good fish other places.  Hopefully you can get the best fish here consistently, hopefully.  This is what we do.  Not every piece of fish tastes the same.  Not every fish is the same, not every portion of the fish is the same.  Again, it’s one of those businesses you wouldn’t choose.  If you have a genetic attachment to it, it’s okay.\n\nQ:  Is there a difference between smoked farmed fish and smoked wild fish?\n\nFederman:  Sure.  By now, most of the people that are the generation below me know pretty much only farmed fish and they don’t know about wild fish.  So that’s their model of, let’s say, salmon, the primary farm fish, should taste like.  Wild fish in its best, there’s nothing like it, you know.  But wild fish, because it’s wild, is subject to so many variables, so that one day it tastes like this, the next day it tastes like that, or it’s leaner or it’s fatter or it’s whatever, so you have all of these things.  Wild fish, also the texture if firmer in wild fish because it’s out there swimming in the wild, and the taste can change based upon what it’s feeding on.  It’s just a lot of variables, so it doesn’t necessarily taste the same today, next week, or whatever.\n\nQ:  When did it become impossible or at least wildly expensive to get—\n\nFederman:  Well, we still have wild fish.  We have wild Pacific king salmon that’s line-caught down there, but, number one, it’s more expensive.  Where the other salmon’s maybe thirty-something dollars a pound, that’s like forty-eight dollars a pound because it’s wild, and that’s being decimated, that Pacific king salmon thing.\n\nQ:  Who buys that?\n\nFederman:  Well, you know, some people like the taste of the wild salmon.  It’s stronger, more assertive, less fatty.  Some people like that.  Some people like the idea of buying wild salmon, so they’ll buy that because they just want to buy wild.  But there’s a market for it, but much less than the other salmons.  What happens in the farming business is that things get better because it’s a business and you have to improve the taste and texture and whatever, and now the concentration is on making sure the stuff you’re feeding these salmon are better, are organic or whatever, they’re not going to pollute the environment.  People are becoming more aware of that.\n\nQ:  Do you remember when you had to make the change to mostly—\n\nFederman:  I don’t know the year.\n\nQ:  Do you remember the feeling?\n\nFederman:  Well, the feeling is like they kept coming in, they want to buy this, whatever, and, you know, I would say no, but then the point is, okay, if you’re going to buy this salmon, you know, it’s based on the catch.  When it’s wild, it’s based on the catch.  Oh, we’re not catching it, so it’s not available, and if you want to buy it, it’s going to cost you five times as much, so you bring it in, but the customers don’t want to pay five times as much.  They’re going to put it on a bagel and cream cheese, you know.  And it looks the same to them.  That’s a portion of the public.  Another portion wants the wild salmon.  So you’re at the point where you’re changing over and a point where the wild salmon no longer makes sense for the smoker to handle because he’s able to—\n\nQ:  I see.  That’s where the difference would take place, at the smokehouse.\n\nFederman:  Yes, not at my level.  At the smokehouse.  He no longer wants to handle it or he can’t buy it because commercial fishing of Atlantic salmon just dies.  Maybe they put an embargo on the fishing of it for a while to see if it regenerates, and it never does.  I’m talking about Atlantic salmon.  It’s a different species.  Pacifica salmon, they’re always catching some some years or worse.  I don’t know of any years that’s better, so they’re always constantly going down.  Then they build the dams and the fish can’t go upstream, and they have oil leaks in the Alaskan bays.\n\nQ:  What about the changeover from lox to smoked salmon?  When did that happen?\n\nFederman:  I don’t know.  I’ve been rooting around, trying to figure this out.  My aunt and my mother are no help.  My father and uncles are dead.  The question is, when did that happen?  I think that it may have been that lox and smoked lox were sold initially, because they were smokers.  It was a German business smoking here, as far as I could tell, and then the Jews in the 1920s began to take over the smokehouses from the Germans.  They were smoking whitefish and carp, the available fish.  Then some sturgeon was plentiful then; it was being smoked.  Mackerel was being smoked and salmon was being smoked.  So salmon was being sold smoked.  Smoked lox and lox, unsmoked lox.\n\nQ:  What does smoked lox taste like?\n\nFederman:  It was salty.  It was still salty.  In the twenties and thirties, the salmon was largely coming from the Pacific.  It wasn’t Nova Scotia in those days.  What they were doing is huge amounts of salmon, so it was cheap.  In the thirties, I think my aunt remembers the price being like 9 cents a quarter of a pound.\n\nQ:  Wow.\n\nFederman:  Right?  So maybe it was a sale, 35 cents a pound.  Most of it was coming from the Pacific, with huge amounts of salmon, and from Alaska on down to California, and they were catching the salmon and they were dumping it into heavy salt brine, because there was no refrigerated rail at that point, and then what they called tierces, big wooden caskets that took like nine hundred pounds of salmon in brine.  So now we have the salmons that were split, gutted, and sitting in this very heavy salt brine as a preservative, because there’s no refrigeration, being shipped by rail to New York ports for transshipment to Europe and some of it staying here, and some of the smokers, who were German and then Jewish, smoked it with their other fish.  It was heavy smoked.  They’d just take it out of the tierce of salt and smoke it.  It was salty.  Then you had the salmon that wasn’t smoked, and people bought one or the other, but it was all salt product.  But still the Jew and the Eastern European had the taste for salt.  They were used to that saltiness.  Now people don’t want things salty.  So that’s what happened.\n\tThen I think it was not until the late thirties or forties that we had refrigerated railcars, we had now the ability to bring—not we, but the smokers, from Nova Scotia large amounts of salmon from that area down quickly.  You didn’t have to put it in heavy salt brine; you could bring it here and fresh-smoke it here without that strong salt, make it down here in a day.  I don’t know what they did.  But it was called a mild cure salmon, and they didn’t have to heavily salt it, and they could smoke it.  They would brine it here, add sugar to it.  They had what’s called a wet cure, be cured that way.\n\nQ:  At some point people referred to Nova, and it seemed to me that what they were talking about was the difference between smoked fish and cured fish, lox and smoked fish.  Is that what Nova meant at that point?\n\nFederman:  Nova meant different things to different people, just like lox does, so it’s all sort of conflated and confused.  They’re all cured.  Smoked fish is all cured, meaning it’s in a salt.  What happens, this allows for smoking the fish to take up the flavor and it’s a preservative.  It’s an osmotic process, osmosis.  So it all has to be salt-cured.  The amount of salt used is regulated now by the government.  You can’t use less of a certain amount as a preservative of these things.  So it’s all cured.  The question is how heavy the salt is.  You can’t be less than a minimum, but how heavy the salt curing is, when the sugar is put in, and then most of it gets smoked, whether it’s whitefish, sturgeon, [unclear].  Then the processes are cold-smoked, which the oven has been—and that’s what happened when you’re buying what you call Nova, smoked salmon, it’s all cold-smoked.  It’s cured and then smoked at maybe 75 degrees maximum, and the smoke is generated outside.  The room is blown in over the salmon, sort of been cured already for a period of time.\n\tOr hot-smoking with whitefish and sturgeon and most of the other fish and baked salmon, what we call [unclear] salmon, are hot-smoked, which means they’re cured again, but they’re put in ovens and the temperature goes to maybe 160, 170 degrees, so it’s actual oven cooking process and you get a different texture.  You get a flaky texture.\n\nQ:  But just plain lox?\n\nFederman:  Just plain lox was just salt-cured, not smoked, and mostly referred to—lox, the word, is anglicized from the German lachs, meaning salmon, so the initial lox, that word anglicized, was about the specific salmons early on that were just caught, dressed, meaning filleted—well, not really filleted.  The bones were in.  But gutted, split, and dumped in these heavy salt brine things, and then either sold, not smoked or smoked, so lox unsmoked or smoked lox, which was smoked.  Then you get these smoked salmons coming in, the Nova Scotia salmon or Pacific salmon, and then salmons from around the world.\n\nQ:  Nobody ever asks for gravlax here?\n\nFederman:  Plenty of gravlax.  Yes, gravlax is just cured and dill and sugar and salt.\n\nQ:  So you sell that here too?\n\nFederman:  Yes.  Now we’re into selling lots of—there’s probably ten different kinds of smoked salmon in the store now, so where we started this conversation was about three, lox, unsmoked, just cured salted salmon, and Nova Scotia Atlantic salmon and Nova Pacifica salmon, that was it.  So now there’s like salmons from all over the world, and most of it is farmed, but we have wild Pacific salmon, still, and some of the salmons from Ireland, from Scotland, from Denmark, they have some general distinguishing characteristics to it, but that changes also.\n\nQ:  Can you taste the difference or can anybody?\n\nFederman:  I can because I have a palette for the stuff.  It’s my business.  If you’re going to put it on a bagel, particularly the bagels that exist today, these big roll-y things, and a lot of cream cheese, you know, it doesn’t really matter, but if you’re going to pay attention to what you’re eating, then some fish you can.  I have downstairs—I gave you a taste the other day—this Danish salmon which is double smoked and a different color, smoked in Denmark with a richer maybe peat or something that gives a different flavor to it.  It’s just wonderful salmon.\n\nQ:  It’s delicate.\n\nFederman:  There’s no point in putting that on a bagel with cream cheese, to me.  Just like what’s the point?  But just to eat it on a cracker with a little fresh pepper on it or just with nothing, it’s spectacular.\n\nQ:  When people in catering order platters, what kind of—\n\nFederman:  Depends on the platter.  We give them a choice of what they want, and then we make a platter of just different kinds of smoked salmon, so they have a platter of five or six different kinds of salmon, or in the standard platter that we make, it’s usually Gaspe salmon, which is the traditional.  It’s basically the same kind as the traditional Nova Scotia that most people like to taste.  It’s mild, it’s delicate, it’s rich.\n\nQ:  Why don’t you tell me about deciding to, as it were, retire.\n\nFederman:  Well, it’s clearly something I never thought about.  Why did I decide to retire?  I was getting to the point where I’d ridden this wave that was crashing.  I came in when the business was really going down.  Business was going down, the neighborhood was going down, and I spent a lot of energy keeping every customer we had and trying to make new customers.  That was my energy.  It was very, as I said, existential.\nThen we just got lucky with the wave that had changed the food world and the neighborhood.  In the food world, people were starting to appreciate.  As the food world got more homogenized and glitzy and big-box-store-y and whatever, then there was that portion that was growing of people who appreciated these little jewel-y kind of places.  They wanted the experience of shopping here, and for most of them, they recognized that we were going to give them a superior product.  So they were going to get not only the product, but they were going to get an experience of what happens when you’re in a store like this and you’re having a communication with the guy who’s selling it to you and you’re watching his hands slice that salmon, as opposed to buying a packaged something.  So you have that, and then in the location where the store pretty much looks like always did in a neighborhood where it always existed.  So that’s a whole other kind of experience.  As the world got away from this, people appreciated it.\nThen the neighborhood started to change in the late eighties, I would say, and then it wasn’t just the druggies and prostitutes and criminals, but always with that there was also the artists and the musicians who lived down here because it was cheap rent.  They would float in and out of here and buy a bagel or whatever.\n\nQ:  It was cheap.\n\nFederman:  Yes.  And people started to recognize this is sort of a cool place.  Then it started to transform itself.  It usually does.  Then people started to move in to be close to this energy that was happening down here.  Some of it was the energy of freefall and some of it was this artistic energy.  So then people wanted to be close to it, particularly young people, and as they moved in, prices went up, the buildings got renovated and the artists couldn’t live here anymore.  But it’s typical of the gentrification, if you want to call it that.\n\tWhat line am I on here?  What am I talking about?\n\nQ:  Retirement.  But I must say, as you’re talking about this, I’m also thinking about Whole Foods up the street.  But anyway, go ahead.\n\nFederman:  Whole Foods up the street, that’s interesting also.\n\nQ:  When did first your nephew, is that right—\n\nFederman:  First Niki, and then Niki left and there was no sense of her coming back.  She was going to get an MBA at Yale and she was going to do something.  At that point I didn’t know I lost her.  I said, “What do you need to go there?  I’ll teach you whatever you want to know right here,” but she didn’t want me to teach her, and there was no sense of her coming back.  She wanted to cut the tie once and for all and go off in the world.\n\tWhen that happened, my nephew, Josh, who had been from time to time, “Hey, Uncle Mark, want me to come in the business?”  He was an engineer on [unclear] working for some big companies.  I don’t even know.  I keep asking him what kind of engineer.  I didn’t know there were more than one kinds.  He was chemical or civil or something, I have no idea, doing something with chips.  It’s a world I know nothing about.  But it seems that he was similarly not happy, not unhappy, but not feeling—“fulfilled” is sort of a trite word.  He was feeling something missing from his life and he wanted to reconnect through the family, because he had sort of a weird family upbringing.  He was brought up on an ashram, because my sisters, in the sixties, you know, everybody in the sixties were all looking for something.\n\nQ:  Remind me who his parents are.\n\nFederman:  There’s three of us.  His mother is my eldest sister, Tara.  She’s two years older than me.  My younger sister is Hope. She’s three and a half years younger.  My oldest, Tara, is two years older than me, my younger sister is three and a half years younger than me.  I’m in the middle.  \nSo Tara, in the sixties, his mother, she was artsy-fartsy and whatever, and she suddenly found herself in the communal world of an ashram.  It was upstate, they moved to California with the guru, and then my younger sister followed that lifestyle, and I was in college in law school and then in the army.  I was following whatever path I thought I was supposed to follow at the moment.\n\tSo my nephew Josh—and he has two sisters—was raised on an ashram, in a communal environment, and his parents were, you know, that spirit.  They had nothing to do with the business here.  They lived upstate, it was a different kind of lifestyle.  They would come into the store once a year, whatever.  My sister would bring them down.  They would run behind the candy counter and take some candy, and that was their experience.  So for him to call me now, when he was an engineer working on the West Coast, and say, “Hey, Uncle Mark, what about me coming into the business?”  And I would constantly say, “Josh, I mean, what do you want?  This is hard.  You don’t know anything about it.”\n\tBut when Niki left and I had had this notion that, okay, I would retire, I would work with Niki for a while and ease out, I had this really romantic notion of working with my daughter, easing out, and by this point, you know, business had gotten better.  The neighborhood got better.  We were getting more famous, you know, and I didn’t have the energy to do it anymore.  This turns out to be tough.  It’s wearing physically because you’re standing on the counter, emotionally, dealing with all the little problems.  I used to look at all these other businesses and they’d multiply.  I’d say, “How do they do this?  How do they run these big businesses?”  I couldn’t get it.  For me it was about watching each sale, each piece of fish, each customer.  I don’t know why I trapped myself like that.  On the other hand, on reflection, it seems it wasn’t such a trap; it’s what I wanted.  I didn’t have grand goals of taking over the world.  I wanted to do the best I could in my corner of the world, the little fish corner of the world in the Lower East Side.\n\tAnyhow, so when I thought I had Niki here and then it became apparent that there would be a succession and then I would have an exit plan, I got very happy, and then Niki left sort of precipitously and I got very unhappy, and I couldn’t muster the energy to think about continuing each day opening the store in the morning, bringing the fish in, facing the same customers.  I was just getting too old for that.  This business will wear you down.  And that’s about when Josh called and said, “Hey, Uncle Mark.  What do you think?”\n\tAnd at this point I said, “Josh, come on in.  I have no idea.  We’ll see what you can do.”  And Josh came in here, and I was very hesitant with Josh because he had no experience in this and he had a different sort of mentality, more corporate, and then I didn’t think he could do it alone.  I tried to make a shidduch.  You know what a shidduch is?  A marriage between Josh and Herman, who was my manager for years now, and that took a lot of sort of energy in trying to figure out how to make that work.  One way was to take myself out of the profit scheme of things, pick myself a minimal salary and turn my profit over to them so they could divide it, to understand if they made money, it was based on their efforts.  So I did that.\n\nQ:  When was that?\n\nFederman:  That was 2003, ’04, ’05, I don’t know.  I did that, and still something missing.  I wasn’t quite comfortable that the two of them could continue it on.  They had the passion, they had the ability, but I wasn’t quite sure of the dynamic.  And then someplace along the line, Niki said, “Hey, Dad, I want to come back in the business.”  She’d been out now in the world, trying various things for three years or so.\n\tI said, “Niki.”  I immediately got protective of my bodily functions, my heart mostly, and said, “Niki, this no longer has anything to do with me.  I will not make a judgment on this.  You need to clear it through Josh and Herman.  They’re running the business.”\n\tSo she did.  They said okay.  She came in a trial period before they cut her in equally.\n\nQ:  This was?\n\nFederman:  This was around 2006, maybe, ’07.  You can’t ask me dates.  \nThen the three of them, and then Maria, who kept on—I made Maria an equal partner of the business someplace along the time, because it seemed to me that she was doing the yeoman’s work and she ought to be invested in it, so she had held on.  Even when I gave up my portion of the profit, she had kept hers, and then when her daughter came in here, she gave hers up so there would be more of a pie for the three of them to divide up.  So then we just became salaried whatever.\nThen Niki came in, then the three of them had been sort of working out their dynamic, and I think largely it works very well.  Niki and Josh, the dynamic there, they complement each other because Niki is this big, expansive person now.  She’ll walk into a room and light up a room.  Everybody I see, “Oh, Niki, your daughter, is the best.”  She’s this, she’s that.  She cares about people.  She shows she cares.  She cares about Russ & Daughters.  She’s carrying on the legacy.  Josh is an engineer, he’s more withdrawn and quiet and less verbal and vocal, but Josh, I love Josh.  Maybe I admire him too.  He can get from Point A to Point B in a straight line.  He’s an engineer, and you need that in business too.  So the two of them are able to do that.  When I came to criticize something, they immediately circled their two wagons and I didn’t get it.  I was the boogey man.  I was from the old school.  I was the dinosaur.\nAnd Herman, I had to teach him the things, a good fish from a bad fish, even a good customer from a bad customer, but my presence is a critical presence.  Didn’t work so well particularly with my daughter, because there’s all that family kind of baggage.  But Herman had been trained by me, so he was there in the mix to present the way that we had done business.  \nSo it seems to me that it has, for the most part, worked out spectacularly well.  I’m very confident now that they’re running the business actually better than I ever have.  The numbers are better.  I come in, the customers are happy, the press is happy, the suppliers are happy, and I come in, and the most important thing to me is I come in and I eat what I want and I taste.  That’s part of the deal in the transfer.  You don’t have to pay me a lot of money, but let me eat what I want.  But the importance of that is, I taste.  I pick up the sturgeon, I feel it, I taste it, and the salmon, and the fish is as good, if not better, so they’re able to stay on top of the product, which is ultimately, no matter how great a schmoozer you are or how famous your business is, you’ve got to deliver consistently good product to the customer.  And they’re doing that.  So, you know, I kvel. \n\nQ:  This is terrific.  Thank you very much.\n\n[End of interview]\n"}}
