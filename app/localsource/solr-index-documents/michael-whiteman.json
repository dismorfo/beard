It’s September 21, 2009, and I’m with Michael Whiteman in his home in Park Slope.\n\tGood afternoon.\n\nWhiteman:  Good afternoon.\n\nQ:  Why don’t we start this with your telling me something about your childhood, when and where you were born, and what influences on you growing up.\n\nWhiteman:  I was born in Brooklyn in 1938, in Flatbush, which is the other side of Prospect Park from where we’re now sitting.  I went to elementary school and junior high school and high school in that neighborhood in the days when you were allowed to walk to school rather than being bused.\n\tMy parents both worked.  My mother, therefore, was an early pioneer of working women.  She also fancied herself to be a very good cook.  There’s a funny story that says I always thought my mother was the best cook in the world until I joined the army.\n\nQ:  That is funny.  [laughs]\n\nWhiteman:  But she was better than that, and she was fairly adventurous, so I remember having things like lamb curry before it became fashionable at dinner parties.  She was, at the time, also famous for her Hawaiian meatballs, which is a dish that’s no longer made, and with very good reason.\n\nQ:  There was pineapple, undoubtedly?\n\nWhiteman:  With the pineapple and the green peppers and the cornstarch.\n\tNobody in the house drank wine, but my father drank very good scotch, and at an early age he allowed me to have some, and I kept on drinking scotch through my teenage years and into my twenties until I discovered that that’s the reason that I was getting hangovers in the morning.  So without knowing why, I just immediately got up one morning and switched to bourbon, and have been a very good bourbon drinker ever since.\n\nQ:  Actually, one of the things that was nice about living in Washington was that bourbon was quite an acceptable thing to drink, it being sort of the South.\n\nWhiteman:  We were giving at the World Trade Center one day a dinner for a whole bunch of foodies who had proceeded to drink everything we could possibly feed them, and they ate a lot.  After dinner, I put brandy glasses on the table and poured little splashes of 100-proof Old Fitzgerald, which I think is no longer made, into each glass, and everybody then began to give their opinion as to what it was they were drinking.  Oh, you heard these rare forms of Armagnac and cognacs and rare brandies from here and there and everything.  So when I finally told them what they were drinking, they got very upset.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  What was education after school in Brooklyn?\n\nWhiteman:  I went to Syracuse University, where I was majoring in engineering, which I discovered I hated.  So without leaving the engineering school, I just stopped taking engineering courses for a couple of years and took English and journalism courses until they caught up with me, when they realized I was taking more credits than was allowed in the liberal arts school because the journalism school took six more credits than liberal arts did.  But I graduated with a degree in English and was working as a journalist for a company that published a string of retail trade magazines.  That was in 1963.\n\nQ:  How did you find them?\n\nWhiteman:  I answered an ad, and it was in those days that you took batteries of tests in order to get employed, and they discovered that I was fit for nothing in the way of a job that they had open, but somebody high up in the organization realized I was probably a useful misfit, and so he hired me.\n\tI went to work on a trade magazine that dealt with what was then a dying breed, but I didn’t know it.  It was something that went to the variety stores, Woolworth’s, Kresge, W.T. Grant, all those kinds of former names.  But the fellow had hired me because he had a feeling that I could probably do things that were out of the ordinary.  So when the editor of On the Drugstore magazine got into trouble, they moved me over there for a while, and then they were starting a discount store newspaper.\n\nQ:  I didn’t know about these.  That’s interesting.\n\nWhiteman:  So I worked on the pilot edition of that for some time.  Somewhere along the way in between there I got drafted, so I was in the army from—my dates are wrong.  I was in the army from 1961 to ’63, so I started working for them, say, in 1960.  When I got out, I went back to them and worked on these other publications.  In 1967, I guess it was, they asked if I would start a restaurant business newspaper because they sensed that the restaurant industry, which at that point was mostly a mom-and-pop business, was emerging as a national chain business.\n\nQ:  That’s fascinating.  That, you said, was ’67?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Interesting.  So what was the scope of what you started?\n\nWhiteman:  It was a tabloid biweekly paper.  It’s now a weekly.  It still exists and is the dominant publication in its field.  It was a paid publication in a field where everything else was given away.\n\nQ:  People had to subscribe to it?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  It had an ABC audit, which is highly unusual in the trade magazine business.  And it became profitable within a year.  It some kind of world’s record.\n\nQ:  This was Nation’s Restaurant News?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  It’s still in the same format.  The only thing that’s changed is that it’s now every week.  It and the industry grew together.  When I started it, even McDonald’s was not a national chain; it was a group of regional chains.  I guess the only thing that was really national was Howard Johnson, because they had somebody who had a franchise in California.  But the industry grew very rapidly, and the newspaper grew very rapidly.\n\tIt was while I was doing that that I was introduced to Joe Baum.  Joe had been the creative force behind Restaurant Associates.\n\nQ:  When did Restaurant Associates start?  I don’t know.\n\nWhiteman:  Restaurant Associates, you’d have to go back in history, but Restaurant Associates started in the fifties, in probably the late fifties.  Joe had worked at the Newarker and had been in on the original process of the development of the Four Seasons and the Forum [of the Twelve Caesars], and then he did Charlie O’s and Charlie Brown’s and La Fonda del Sol.  So Joe was fundamentally the father of the theme restaurant, which is something he hated to be called.  But it’s all his fault.  [laughs]  He lost the boardroom battle in 1967 at Restaurant Associates and—\n\nQ:  Oh, that’s interesting.\n\nWhiteman:  —and had gotten a contract with the Port Authority of New York to create the master plan for restaurants in the then-under-construction World Trade Center.  As part of his contract, he needed a consultant to work with him, and although I knew absolutely nothing about the restaurant business in terms of it being an operational business, I had been writing a lot and traveling a lot.  I spent half my time traveling across the country.\n\nQ:  So you were the editor of Nation’s Restaurant News.\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So in that capacity, you were traveling to see what was going on?\n\nWhiteman:  Correct.  So I jumped ship.  I figured I could always be a journalist if need be.  [laughter]  Of course, that was 1967.  That was 1971.  So I began working with Joe on the World Trade Center in 1971, which was just beginning to come out of the ground.  The first thing that the Port Authority needed was a temporary restaurant to feed the people who were building it, and the porters and people like that who were cleaning up after the people who were building it, and the early tenants, because the building was obviously being built from the bottom up, but as the lower floors became available, people were moving in.  So there was an office constituency and a kind of construction constituency.  We built a self-service restaurant out of construction materials, corrugated metal and construction lamps and pipe scaffolding, and it was meant to last for three years.  It was meant to last about three years.  I think it lasted about twenty.  It was extremely successful.\n\nQ:  Did the two of you work out the concept together or what?\n\nWhiteman:  We worked on the concept together, and he decided I should learn something about the restaurant industry, so I also became its manager.  So I managed the place during the day, which was down at the World Trade Center, and we had our offices in the Port Authority headquarters, which were on 8th Avenue and 15th Street.  So I would shuttle back and forth between conceptual meetings and design meetings and putting out fires in this restaurant.\n\tThere were a whole set of amazing contrasts, because here I was running a restaurant that was filled largely in the evening by drunken construction workers, and during the day by people in business suits, and so by day I was laboring in the basement and having meetings in the evening about how to help create Windows on the World on the top of the building.  [laughs]\n\tThe Port Authority had given Joe this contract with one very specific requirement, and that is that they wanted a club on top of one of the towers.  The history of clubs in the United States, right through to this day, is that they lose money, especially when they’re clubs in office buildings.  So Joe applied a formula that he had worked on once before on top of the Time-Life Building where there was a club as well during lunch, that became a public restaurant in the evening, and applied that principle to Windows on the World.  So it was a club during the day and a restaurant in the evening.\n\tWhat was really revolutionary—I use that word advisedly.  What was really revolutionary about Windows is that when people were developing clubs around the country, especially in office buildings, they made them look like clubs, you know, the trappings of full masculinity and leather chairs and fireplaces and oriental carpets and beamed ceilings and all that stuff.\n\nQ:  It looked quiet.\n\nWhiteman:  Windows turned the whole thing on its head, with the idea that we would design the greatest evening restaurant that we possibly could and make it as famous as we possibly could so that people would kill to join the club, rather than having people join a club that you then strained into trying to make an unsuccessful public restaurant.\n\nQ:  So the concept was as a club initially?\n\nWhiteman:  No, the concept was to do a great restaurant that served as a club during the day.\nAt the time, New York was in real trouble.  The West Side Highway had broken, literally had collapsed right in front of the World Trade Center.  Wall Street was in its worst shape since the depression.  Sounds familiar.  No one lived downtown.  It was an absolute wasteland in the evening, and the city itself was on the verge of bankruptcy, was bankrupt.  So there were numerous editorials and attacks on what we were doing on top of the World Trade Center, because we were building this two-story extravaganza.  It was on the 106th and 107th floor of 1 World Trade Center, and we were squandering public money on this folly that the Port Authority had because they wanted to build this icon up in the—\n\nQ:  Was it all private money that—\n\nWhiteman:  This is Port Authority money.\n\nQ:  I mean public money.  But Port Authority money is public money.  Was there any private money as well?\n\nWhiteman:  No, it was public money.  And they quoted George Lang, who was a competitive consultant at the time, in one of their articles [unclear] against what we were doing at the World Trade Center, saying, of course, the city was bankrupt, no one would go down there, etc., etc., etc.  Well, in 1976, we opened and it was an enormous success, and it was an enormous success for a lot of reasons.  Number one was, I think, everybody wanted it to be a success because the city couldn’t tolerate another public failure.  It was the original Up Sail so the Port and all the waterfront which we were facing was suddenly very active and a lot of filming was done from up there of Up Sail, so we had national exposure.  And it was this grand, grand restaurant in the sky where the food was so good that nobody equated it with other rooftop restaurants where you only went up for the view and you tolerated what was put on your plate.\n\nQ:  You had a lot of culinary consultants, as I recall.\n\nWhiteman:  We had Jacques Pépin, who was organizing a commissary for us down in the bowels of the building.  We had Albert Kumin, who was the great pastry chef, formerly of the Four Seasons, who then left us to become pastry chef at the White House.  We had Barbara Kafka, who worked brilliantly on menus, and James Beard, who worked with us on not just menus, but philosophy of food.  Jim was really quite wonderful.  The stories, they could go on forever.\n\nQ:  Tell me what it was like to work with Jim Beard.\n\nWhiteman:  Jim could be difficult until he wasn’t.  You could ask Jim the wrong questions for half a day and get nothing back.  When you pressed the right button, he suddenly became a fountain.\n\nQ:  Did you learn what the right buttons were?\n\nWhiteman:  No, you never really knew.  You never really knew.  But the broader the question you asked him, the better.  Sometimes he would just sit and talk, and sometimes he would produce these long memos on legal pads that were bigger than that, and long just stream-of-consciousness writing.  I’m not sure I have any of them any longer.  I did once.  They may have come down in the World Trade Center.\n\nQ:  So these meetings would take place with you and Joe and Jim Beard and with other people as well?\n\nWhiteman:  No, Joe never had a meeting with two or three people.  It was as many people as he could put into a room would come to a meeting.  Joe would put together a lot of people who were not particularly qualified to do what was asked of them, but if you put enough of them into the room, some brilliance would emerge, and that was his technique.\n\tSo there would very often be a meeting of Joe and Jim and Barbara and very often Milton Glaser, who didn’t really know that much about food, but had a lot to say and a lot of insight, and there was somebody who was thinking in three dimensions in a room where everybody was thinking about something on a plate.  So we were dealing with all of the senses.  It was a remarkable brain trust of people.  You would occasionally have an advertising genius sitting in on a food conference.\n\nQ:  The food part of this brain trust, did these people get along with each other?\n\nWhiteman:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Not in the sense that everybody was unanimous.  If there was disagreement, it wasn’t friction; it was disagreement of a lot of brilliant people.\nJim, of course, brought an enormous sense of history.  I remember once Joe asked a question about lamb stew, which is something that nobody would serve today, and we got a memo back from Jim.  It must have been eight pages about lamb stew.  I am paraphrasing, but I’m pretty close to the language.  He said something like, “We have to have a lamb stew, all buttery and creamy and so voluptuous that you want to cuddle it in your arms.”  Now, that’s not a recipe, and if you call the chef in and say, “Jim wants lamb stew that you can cuddle,” you’d better have a patient chef, because you would then go through a dozen iterations of lamb stew until everybody said, “Oh, I can cuddle that.”  But that’s how the food was developed.\n\nQ:  Over how long a period of time was that?\n\nWhiteman:  A couple of years.  We did a restaurant in—let me backtrack.  Windows on the World was the most famous restaurant of everything we did in the World Trade Center.  Number one, it was highly innovative, and I can give you chapter and verse on that later.  In addition to that, it had all that visibility.  The best restaurant that we had in the World Trade Center was also down in the basement.  It was called the Market Bar and Dining Rooms, and it was a three-star restaurant, from the New York Times.  Windows never got more than one or two.  It was a three-star restaurant in the basement of the World Trade Center.  It had no signage.  It had no entrance.  Our busiest nights of the week were Friday night and Saturday night when there was no one whatsoever in Lower Manhattan.  People were coming to it.  It was a restaurant that was largely beefy, hence the name.  It was on the site of the old Washington markets, so that was the derivation of the Market Bar and Dining Room.\n\tJoe came to me one day and said, “Vegetables.”  I’d been laboring on this beefy menu.  Joe came, just stuck his head in my door and said, “Vegetables.”  So I produced a laundry list of kinds of vegetables that could be served, and he looked at it and he said, “No, that’s not what I mean.”\n\nQ:  Had you produced the equivalent of sides or what?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, I didn’t really know what he wanted.  He didn’t know what he wanted.  So I did another list, and that didn’t get us anywhere.  So I said to Jim at a meeting about something else, I said, “Joe keeps talking to me about vegetables, and I don’t know what he wants.”\n\tSo Jim looked at the lists and he said, “Why don’t you put a whole head of cauliflower on a tray with a carving knife and a fork and just set it on the table.”\n\nQ:  Cooked or not?\n\nWhiteman:  Cooked.  He said, “Maybe that’s what Joe means.”  So we did, and Joe looked at it and said, “Oh, that’s a start.”  [laughter]  Never satisfied.  He didn’t know where this was going to go, but he was never satisfied.\n\tSo, eventually, we ended up with not a plate, but a platter, a big platter, that would either have a whole head of cauliflower or a giant mound of broccoli in the center, and there might be six other vegetable preparations around it.  We sold it as a vegetable platter for the table, and it became the top seller in the restaurant, in this beef-oriented restaurant.\n\nQ:  That’s really interesting.\n\nWhiteman:  We had a vegetable sommelier.\n\nQ:  Oh, my.\n\nWhiteman:  That was his title.  We had a vegetable sommelier.  His job was to walk around and tell everybody—sometimes he’d have a basketful of vegetables, walk around and tell the guests what we had in the way of vegetables and what we were preparing that night, and how we could do this or that, and how it might appear on this whole vegetable platter.  And it worked.\n\nQ:  And where do these vegetables come from, from the market or—not from farmers at that point.\n\nWhiteman:  No.  Actually, Joe did buy from farmers but not then.  He bought from farmers before that for the Four Seasons.\n\nQ:  Oh, of course.  That makes sense, yes.\n\nWhiteman:  But we did have an interesting menu.  The Market Bar and Dining Room’s menu had a series of boxes, maybe fifteen or twenty boxes, down the center of the menu, with the names of the suppliers from whom we were buying.  So there were two or three meat people, two or three fish people, a couple of vegetable people, and the boxes with their names.  And the day’s specials were written in the boxes from whom we bought the product.\n\nQ:  That was way ahead of the fashion for it.\n\nWhiteman:  This was in 1976.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Wow.  What happened to that restaurant?\n\nWhiteman:  I think it was after the first bombing in 1993, the Port Authority did a big renovation on that level.  I think it became a Port Authority security command post.  They made a whole bunch of other changes on that floor.\n\nQ:  Meanwhile, let me get this clear, though.  You were working for and with Joe, right?\n\nWhiteman:  Correct.\n\nQ:  On other projects at the same time?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.\n\nQ:  You were very young and he was not, and that makes an interesting relationship.  How did that work?\n\nWhiteman:  I would have been—\n\nQ:  Considerably younger than he.\n\nWhiteman:  I was in my thirties.  I was in my mid-thirties, and he would have been, I think, fifteen years older than I am, so he would have been in his fifties or thereabouts.  He was always fifteen years older than I was.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Right.  And how did you work together?  Did you have, I don’t know, specific areas you were responsible for?\n\nWhiteman:  No, there were no lines of authority working for Joe, and you never knew what you were going to be doing next or with whom.  But since Joe was a consultant and I was a consultant with Joe, Joe had a clause in his contract that said the majority of his time had to be given to the Port Authority, so we didn’t do a lot of consulting work, but it was fairly high profile.  We did the master plan for an expansion for the National Gallery of Art in Washington when I.M. Pei put his building up there.\n\nQ:  You mean for the basement cafeteria?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes, but not just the cafeteria.  There were other places in that building to eat.  There was a Scholar’s Lounge and there was an Executive Dining Room and I forget what else.\n\nQ:  There were lovely places to eat in that building.\n\nWhiteman:  So we did that.  We did an insurance company’s headquarters, and we did a seven- or nine-story Food Center in Hiroshima.\n\nQ:  Wow.  And you were known as restaurant consultants?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  And we did a couple of food courts for shopping center developers who came to see what we were doing.\n\nQ:  Tell me about the food courts and the first food court and how all that came about.\n\nWhiteman:  There was one food court, sort of, which was opened around that time, which was at the Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston, which opened while we were working on ours.  Ours was the first that was run by a single operator.  The one in Faneuil Hall was parceled out to a lot of individual tenants.\n\nQ:  So when was yours?\n\nWhiteman:  Ours opened in ’76.  It was interesting in a couple of ways.  Number one, it was run by one company.  Number two, we knew that when evening came, there would not be much of a population in the building, so we were not going to get a lot of business then.  But we were occupying a prime piece of real estate, and it was Joe’s idea for some of the elements of this food court to become retail shops in the evening.  So if we weren’t selling ham and cheese sandwiches in the evening, we had a small gourmet shop that sold a variety of cheeses and charcuterie and salads for people to take home.\n\nQ:  So what did that actually look like?  Was it, I don’t know, a circle, a square?\n\nWhiteman:  It was a big, big complex.  It had about 350 seats.  It had a deli that became a gourmet shop in the evening.  It had a bakery that sold things in dough for lunch, like a quiche or pot pie or—I don’t remember.  But it also sold cakes and pies that we made at the Trade Center, and hundreds and hundreds of dozens of loaves of bread that we had developed for us and we sold them at retail for people going home.  We had a coffee, tea, soup kiosk.  This is long before the advent of the coffee store.  It sold a variety of coffees and pastries during breakfast.  It sold soup for lunch.  It sold coffees by the pound and teas by the ounce and coffeemakers to take home in the evening.  We had a rotisserie that served ribs and chicken by the plate during lunch, and by the pound to take home in the evening.  It was interesting.\n\nQ:  What was this called?\n\nWhiteman:  It was called The Big Kitchen.\n\nQ:  Did people get their food by going to these individual, as it were, stations?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  And unlike what you see in a typical shopping center today, where all these stands are lined up shoulder to shoulder and they just look like one continuous slot in the wall with little paper dividers between them, the stations were really quite separate, and you ate in amidst them, so you felt as if you were in a market kind of environment.\n\nQ:  How was that written about?  Was it reviewed?\n\nWhiteman:  Oh yes.  It got international press, and it’s that that won the—I think it was the Bard Award for Urban Design.  Milton Glaser had designed not so much a sign as there were a bunch of freestanding three-dimensional letters that read out “The Big Kitchen,” and the letters were about seven feet high and about two feet thick, and the backs of some of the letters became merchandising for some of the retail stands.\n\nQ:  Oh, that is very smart.  I guess what I’m getting at, was it reviewed in terms of the food, in terms of the urban concept.\n\nWhiteman:  Both.  It got a very good review, and I think it maybe got the longest review the New York Times had ever written.  And the thing gave the Port Authority fits, the sign did, because I remember the letter G.\n\nQ:  What was it advertising on the back?\n\nWhiteman:  People would ease their fanny into the lower portion of the letter of G and sit there and read the Times, and kids would climb up and leap from letter to letter to letter, which drove the insurance people batty.  People who were courting would hide behind the letters.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Was it perceived of as a new concept?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  I may, in my files downstairs, have a review of it.  So it was really quite something, and it was very successful.  We didn’t know how to run it, so we had to learn as we were doing it.  It was a real bitch, but it was great.  We must have done four or five other food courts.\n\nQ:  People came to you to ask—?\n\nWhiteman:  People came to us.  We did the first fast food court in Japan in Hiroshima.\n\nQ:  When was that?\n\nWhiteman:  In 1977 or ‘78.  We did the first food court in continental Europe in Brussels around the same time, maybe 1980, and those were both urban food courts.  Then we did four or five suburban food courts, which are the typical ones you see today.  So we apologize for that.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Well, I don’t know.  They’re very helpful, actually.\n\nWhiteman:  Well, you see, at the time, shopping centers were developed with food scattered about the shopping center, which made a fair amount of sense because it would interrupt your movement through the shopping center and you would stop and have something, get up refreshed and ready to shop again.  What the shopping center developers saw in the food court that we did was that it became the quasi anchor, and so it changed the whole thinking about how food and shopping centers related to each other.  So rather than food being merely an amenity that was dispersed throughout the shopping center, it now became a focal point and a destination all its own.\n\nQ:  How big was your company at that point?\n\nWhiteman:  Oh, it was giant.  I mean, there were—\n\nQ:  Did you have architects, did you have—no?\n\nWhiteman:  No, we had nothing.  We were three.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Oh, I see.  Oh, my goodness.  Really giant.\n\nWhiteman:  Were we ever more than three?  We may have been four at one time, but we never got larger than that.\n\nQ:  So you would hire people as you needed them?\n\nWhiteman:  Barbara was a consultant.  Jim was a consultant.  Milton Glaser would have been a consultant.  When we got everything opened and running at the World Trade Center, we went from a company of four to, I don’t know, a company of about nine hundred, but the consulting company was never really more than four.  It was an operating company which had the nine hundred people.  Same bosses.\n\nQ:  That’s all really interesting.  Who decided what kinds of projects to take on?  Did you do that together?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, we were very arrogant.  Because of the high visibility of what we had done and the publicity that it got all around the world, we spent the first year and a half without stationery or business cards.  The phone would just ring.  And I used to publish non-client list.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  What was that?\n\nWhiteman:  That’s what we called it because we had this long list of people that wanted us to work for them, we would just scratch out the people we weren’t interested in, which is no longer true.  So we were very fortunate to have a whole roster of very interesting projects.  After we did the National Gallery in Washington, we worked on a master plan for the Metropolitan Museum.  We worked on the master plan for the Getty Museum in California.  Of course, we got some other high-profile top-of-roof restaurants, one of which was the Rainbow Room.\n\nQ:  When was the Rainbow Room?\n\nWhiteman:  We reopened the Rainbow Room in 1987, so I guess we started working on it in 1985, and that started as a consulting project.  The Rockefellers came to us and asked us to consider re-planning the entire top of what was then the RCA Building.  It was an interesting confluence of times, because they had huge amount of office leases coming due around then, and office rents had gone—I’m making up numbers, but I’m not far wrong—had gone from five dollars a square foot when they were signed, to about fifty dollars or more, and they knew they were going to lose large numbers of people.  They were spending millions and millions of dollars on rehabbing Rockefeller Center, but it was money nobody would ever see.  It was security systems and redone sidewalks and HVAC and all the stuff behind the walls, and they needed something to refocus business and social attention on Rock Center.  It was also around the time that NBC was making noises about moving out, and that’s a giant tenant.  They were over a million square feet themselves.\n\tIt was just coincidental that the lease with the then current operator of the Rainbow Room was also expiring and was not going to be renewed.  So our assignment was to refocus attention, both business and social attention, on the Rockefeller Center, and the way to do that was to resurrect the Rainbow Room in the same publicly visible manner as we had done with Windows on the World.\n\nQ:  What was the concept for the Rainbow Room?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, you know, you don’t have to do much in the way of a concept for the Rainbow Room.  The Rainbow Room itself was restored, which is a misnomer, but we said it was being restored.  We removed everything from the Rainbow Room, right down to the brick, except for the chandelier that’s in there, which was too big to move, and rebuilt it and made some changes, including how you got into the room itself.  The changes was so minor that you really have to know what was done, but thousands of people came up there and made reservations and said, “Isn’t it wonderful what they’ve done to the Rainbow Room?”  Well, visually, we had done practically nothing to it.  The rest we destroyed and started over again, reshaping rooms and spaces, but the idea was fundamentally a deco-ish design, so you really didn’t have to invent the world.\n\nQ:  In line with the architecture of the building, you mean?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  It was in the bar at the Rainbow Room that we revived all the old cocktails.\n\nQ:  Like what?\n\nWhiteman:  We had a list of about forty old cocktails.  Between The Sheets.  [laughs]  I remember that one.  But they were all genuine cocktails.  Nobody was drinking cocktails at the time.  We brought the martini back, only we weren’t smart enough to know that people would drink anything if you put it in a martini glass, so we just made really good martinis.  [laughs]  But it was a really important bar because it did start the martini craze and the cocktail craze, and the notion of small plates and little meals began there.\n\tRosanne Gold, to whom I’m married, did a fabulous menu called Cocktails and Little Meals, and you got these sharable plates that came on tea stands, three-tiered tea stands, that went along with all these old-fashioned cocktails.\n\nQ:  What year did this happen?\n\nWhiteman:  1987.  We were always ahead of our time.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  When you were doing things like this, when you were working with places like the National Gallery or other public spaces, presumably you had to reshape support systems like the kitchen and that kind of thing, yes?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.\n\nQ:  So how did that work?  Would you bring in architects?\n\nWhiteman:  For reasons I can’t explain, we turned out to be very good at speaking the language of design and architecture and speaking the language of food and menus, although only one of us was a chef, and that’s Rosanne.  Because we were also operators, we understood how to design a kitchen, so we spoke the language of kitchen design.  We never really designed our own kitchens, but we could lay them out, and we could manage, and still do, manage the work of professional kitchen designers.  So we would bring them in as consultants.\n\nQ:  So in places like the National Gallery, was there space that you could reconfigure?  Well, of course, I guess in the I.M. Pei extension, that didn’t exist in the first place.\n\nWhiteman:  No, that was all new space.\n\nQ:  So that was possible.  But in the older parts of the building?\n\nWhiteman:  No, it was all new space, because all of the food work we did was in the new wing.\nIt might be useful to describe how we worked on projects like that.  The World Trade Center and the National Gallery, well, they’re two quite different projects or had some fundamental similarities.  When you’re starting with a blank piece of paper, you have to figure out what to do.  In order to figure out what to do, you have to figure out what you need to know, because these are not just acts of random creativity.\n\tIn the case of the World Trade Center, we commissioned a major survey of dining habits in Lower Manhattan, and when we were all done, we knew how many people had to eat for under three dollars—I’m making up a number because I don’t remember what the prices were back then, but we knew how many people had to eat typically for under three dollars, how many people could eat for as high ten dollars and how many could spend twenty dollars.  So we had some kind of ratio as to the portions of how people spent their money on food.\n\nQ:  This was people in the building or the people in the neighborhood?\n\nWhiteman:  There was no building.  It was all of Lower Manhattan.\n\nQ:  Did Soho exist at that point?\n\nWhiteman:  No, although it was beginning.\n\nQ:  Actually, that’s Tribeca. \n\nWhiteman:  That’s too far north.  There was no Tribeca.  I’m not even sure, I don’t think there was a name Tribeca then.\n\nQ:  Yes.  People weren’t living around there.\n\nWhiteman:  No.  But we had some then idea of proportion of how many people could eat for various price levels.  We knew there were going to be about 50,000 people working in the Trade Center, and we knew they would be something like another 50,000 people passing through the building for one reason or another, especially since we were on top of a major transit hub.  So you work out some number of what the gross demand is.  You figure out how many people are away on sick, vacation, and travel, which is a big number, which everybody forgets.  We found out how many people bring lunch from home.  We found out how many people don’t eat at all.  So you start subtracting from the gross number until you get something we defined ourselves, was our term, called net effective demand.  From that you then begin to say, “Okay, I now have X number of people who need to be fed at three dollars.  How do we do that?  Do we open fifteen coffee shops?  Do we open a giant cafeteria?”  I mean, there’s all that range of choices.  Fast food was not necessarily in the world back then.\n\nQ:  So in the World Trade Center, what did you do?\n\nWhiteman:  The solution to that was The Big Kitchen, which would allow us to serve large numbers of people quickly, with food that they could either eat on the premises or take back to the office, and the people who could spend over twenty dollars went to Window on the World.\n\tBut we segmented the entire group of net-effective-demand people and built places that we thought were sized appropriately to satisfy that demand, and the same thing took place at the National Gallery.  We had a sense of how many visitors they had, how many visitors they were projecting, how many were going to come in bus tours and school groups, how many were going to be like you and me and just coming, how many would be there between the hours of eleven and two, and what percentage of them you reasonably could expect would want to eat.  Then you figure out a form to make that work.  In the case of the National Gallery, it was this big cafeteria with lots of different stations where you didn’t have to wait in a single line.  You could hop and pop around.  So basically it was a food court except that you didn’t pay each station; you paid at the end.\n\nQ:  Was that new?\n\nWhiteman:  We didn’t invent it, but it was a fairly new form at the time.\n\nQ:  It is, by the way, a very favorite place for people to go for lunch when they’re on jury duty in the federal court, and the food there is so horrible, and if you can manage to get across the streets to the National Gallery, it’s a big plus.\n\nWhiteman:  Well, one of the issues that you deal with when you’re working on a museum is whether the food is in a free zone or a paid zone.\n\nQ:  What is the difference?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, if you want to eat the Metropolitan Museum, first you have to pay your entrance fee in order to get to the food.  If you want to eat at the National Gallery, you can get to it for free.  If you want to eat at the Getty, if you can walk up there, which you can’t, you can eat without paying to get in.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  Then how would that affect then what kind of food facilities you develop?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, if you can get in without paying, depending on where you’re located, you suddenly begin to expand the demand.  So now you need a facility that’s larger than otherwise would be the case.  So they are all very interesting problems.\n\nQ:  Now, meanwhile, were there other—there must have been, but how many food consultancy businesses, restaurant consultancy businesses began to develop?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, there was George Lang, who—oh, by the way, I never finished the George story.\n\nQ:  Yes, do.\n\nWhiteman:  When we opened in 1976 and Windows was a great success, there was an editorial in the Times or an article in the Times talking about that success, and they quoted George as saying, “Well, of course it’s a success.  Look at the location they had.”  [laughs]  There was George, there was us, and quite honestly, there was nobody else in the country that I know of who was capable of doing that level of work.  There were a lot of kitchen consultants who also did restaurant consulting as part of what they did, but I don’t think there was anybody capable of working on the large complicated projects that we were doing.  Nowadays, by the way, no one needs a restaurant consultant.\n\nQ:  Tell me why.\n\nWhiteman:  When we began, there weren’t any architects and designers that knew how to design restaurants, so we had to teach them, and it was before the days of the star chef and it was before the days when chefs had lots of restaurants.  The famous people in the restaurant business when we started were usually the owners, and they were successful owners because they were in the front of the house of their restaurant all the time.  So there were very few of them who had more than one restaurant.\n\tWhat Joe did, which nobody really understands—you know, they call Joe the father of the theme restaurant because he opened up all these themey places.  What Joe did was to substitute a lot of razzle-dazzle design and a lot of in-your-face food in theme-ing and make it all strong enough so that it would be a substitute for the personality of the owner on the premises.\n\nQ:  Did he do that consciously?\n\nWhiteman:  No.  Just came out that way.  And it was because of that, that he was able to open so many restaurants.  So the heirs of that are people like Danny Meyer and Drew Nieporent and Wolfgang Puck and all the star chefs who you see on television now who became famous not because they owned a lot of restaurants, but because they were famous because they were famous, which allowed them to open a lot of restaurants.  But those are the heirs to the notion that you could replace the personality of the owner or the personality of the chef on the premises with something else.\n\nQ:  When did that take place, if you can give a date?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, Joe started doing that before I began working with him, so it would have been in the fifties.\n\nQ:  How did he create the kind of business that he had?  What did he do before that?\n\nWhiteman:  Joe?\n\nQ:  Yes.  He didn’t just emerge fully formed.\n\nWhiteman:  No.  He grew up in the hotel business.  His family owned a hotel in Saratoga Springs, and he worked in Florida at some of the resort hotels there.  He was hired by the then president of Restaurant Associates to come up and open the Newarker, which was Restaurant Associates’ first theme restaurant.  The Newarker was a grand, flamboyant restaurant at Newark Airport, which was the last place you would ever think anybody would want to go for dinner, but it was the beginning of mass commercial travel and the jet age, and people would go out to the airport just to watch the planes take off and have dinner.\n\nQ:  He brought in food consultants for that as well, didn’t he?\n\nWhiteman:  I don’t know whether anybody worked as a food consultant on that.  I think Jerry Brody, who was the president of Restaurant Associates, and Joe dreamed it up.  I don’t think they had any consultants at the time.  They didn’t exist.\n\nQ:  At what point did Joe’s business begin to describe itself—well, how did it describe itself?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, after he lost his boardroom battle, he became a consultant.\n\nQ:  But what kind?  A restaurant—\n\nWhiteman:  Not a food consultant.  It was a restaurant consultant.  And we still call ourselves food and restaurant consultants, but it’s mostly restaurant consulting that we do.\n\nQ:  That must have been a fairly daring thing for him to do.\n\nWhiteman:  Well, in a way it was, except that he had one fairly large project in his pocket called the World Trade Center.  We ended up designing and putting into operation a quarter of a million square feet of food space, which is a lot of food space.\n\nQ:  In the World Trade Center.\n\nWhiteman:  In the World Trade Center.  And it was a project that began in 1970 and ended in 1979.\n\nQ:  So that paid the bills.\n\nWhiteman:  We put everything into operation at the World Trade Center.  Hilton International—let me back up.  We were consultants to the Port Authority.  We created the master plan and the designs for everything that was to be built there.  The Port Authority went out looking for operators, and, ironically, they got very few responses because, number one, of the economic conditions in Lower Manhattan; number two, nobody wanted to operate that thing on top of the building which was absolutely going to be a failure.  But they were interested in all the other stuff.\n\tThe winning proposal was from Hilton International, which is not the same as Hilton domestic.  It was owned at the time by TWA.  Hilton International signed a master lease to operate all the restaurants in the World Trade Center, with the proviso that we open everything and run it for three years, because they had absolutely no idea how to do this.\n\nQ:  You did that with them or without them or what?\n\nWhiteman:  We did that.  They signed the lease.\n\nQ:  Hilton International signed the lease to—\n\nWhiteman:  Yes, and they formed a wholly owned subsidiary called INHILCO.  It’s an inversion of Hilton International.  Basically, we became INHILCO for the first three years of its operation, and at the end of the three years, we gave them the key and they operated it from then on, and we went back to being consultants.\n\nQ:  So your company set up all the restaurant possibilities in—\n\nWhiteman:  And ran them.  We opened them and ran them for three years.  Not very many companies can say this, but we moved from the 106th floor to the 63rd floor, so we moved down a lot.  [laughs]  And moved our consulting offices to the 63rd floor.\n\nQ:  About how many people were involved in food service in the World Trade Center?\n\nWhiteman:  Eight hundred or so.\n\nQ:  Did that project change the nature of how the company saw itself, your company?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, it didn’t have to see itself, because everybody else saw it.  They defined us, and that’s when we were publishing this non-client list.\n\nQ:  Oh, you actually published it?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, I mean, amongst ourselves.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  I see.  What kinds of non-clients were there?  What kinds of projects did you not want to take on?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, sometimes we would get things in places where we’d have to change planes to get there, and we said the hell with that.  [laughs]  Sometimes they were just too small.  Our fees were very high, so very often they were just too small or too impractical or just not interesting.  To this day, we take on jobs that generally are either interesting or too rich to say no, but we do a fair number of jobs for people who come to us with absolutely no money and a couple of kids who need some help.\n\nQ:  What kinds of projects might they be?\n\nWhiteman:  Oh, somebody might be opening a prototype for a health food store chain and they don’t really have any financing, and so we’ll do it for next to nothing.\n\nQ:  Why?\n\nWhiteman:  If it’s interesting.  You know, it’s one of those sometimes you look at a job and say, well, why not?\n\nQ:  The restaurant business has changed considerably from the time you all started working with restaurants, yes?\n\nWhiteman:  Oh yes.\n\nQ:  How would you describe that?\n\nWhiteman:  It’s changed more than once, and I’ll describe it to you after I have a bladder break.  [laughs]\n[Interruption]\n\nQ:  We were talking about changes in the restaurant business.\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Could you describe them over time?\n\nWhiteman:  There have been a whole cluster of changes since we started working.  As I said earlier, most successful restaurants were run by single proprietors who usually were people in the front of the house rather than famous chefs.  Nobody knew who chefs were.  They knew who the owners were.  There were a whole series of shifts around the time we started working.  One was that people from other fields found it respectable to work to work in the restaurant business.\n\nQ:  From other fields like?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, two people come to mind, but they’re just examples of a larger number.  Jeremiah Tower, who was an architect, decided to be a restaurateur, opened a very successful restaurant in San Francisco called Stars and became famous because of it and opened a whole bunch of other restaurants.  Barry Wine, whose earlier life I just can’t recall, but it had nothing to do with food, opened The Quilted Giraffe in New York, and it became a success.  And there were a whole group of people who maybe ten years earlier would never have considered working in the restaurant business as a profession because it wasn’t really respectable and it wasn’t a profession.\n\nQ:  When are we talking about right now with Barry?\n\nWhiteman:  We’re talking about the late sixties.  There were people who got into the restaurant business around that time who had gone to college, graduated with good degrees and gone to good schools, who decided that they couldn’t bear to work for a large corporation.  It was that time of life when everybody was anti-corporate, and so they began to work in restaurants as cooks and chefs.  It became an outlet for creative expression and began to lend an air of respectability to the restaurant industry.  Very big change.\n\nQ:  How did that change the kind of people who ate in restaurants and the habit of eating in restaurants?\n\nWhiteman:  I’m not sure that’s what changed the kinds of people who ate in restaurants.  I don’t think you can isolate one thing from another.  It was around that time that increasingly large numbers of women joined the workforce, and as a result of that, the number of people who had to eat out every day multiplied and continued to multiply, by the way, until just a couple of years ago.  Two things happened when women began to enter the workforce.  Number one, the number of meals that had to be eaten out during the day multiplied, and, number two, the number of people who had income to eat out more frequently in the evening also multiplied, while at the same time the amount of time people had to prepare food at home diminished.  So irrespective of who was doing the cooking in the restaurants, there was an increase in demand, and that increase in demand made it possible for the kinds of people that I’m talking about to get into the restaurant industry, which otherwise might not have been the case.  So that was a very big change.\n\tOn top of that, food became a matter of style rather than just something you ate, and people began to link food with design as a matter of self-expression.  I don’t know what the year was, but if you go back to the beginnings of a magazine called Apartment Life, you will find in that the beginnings of the integration of food with design.  So at some point in the process, designers began to become familiar household names and people began to talk about who designed the restaurant and where the china came from and who designed the uniforms, so it became part of the vocabulary.\nAlso at the same time, we began to see the introduction of a new kind of American cooking, which was basically the injection of foreign ingredients into an American vocabulary, and that was the beginning of the so-called fusion food.  So it was in the 1970s, I guess, that you began to get smoked duck burritos with brie and topped with caviar.  I used to make fun of all this mixed-metaphor cooking, except that’s really the way people today have told us they want to eat.\n\nQ:  What do you mean?\n\nWhiteman:  I mean that people no longer distinguish their food by its geography or by its ethnicity, because American food has now become this fusion amalgam of all manner of ethnicity, and nobody cares where the food came from anymore because it didn’t come from anywhere.  It got smooshed together, which was not the case when Jim wrote American Cookery.\n\nQ:  That’s an old copy.  Is that Roseanne’s or yours?\n\nWhiteman:  He inscribed it to me.\n\nQ:  Oh, how spectacular.\n\nWhiteman:  So it’s 1972.\n\nQ:  How wonderful.\n\nWhiteman:  There’s not much in the way of ethnicity in here.  This is basically American regional cooking, as it was known at the time, and it was American, so you won’t find heuvos rancheros in there, and if you did, it would be a standard heuvos rancheros.  It wouldn’t be a heuvos rancheros with naturally raised local oxtails, which you would not be surprised to find that on today’s menu or made with organic duck eggs with a salad of micro greens on the side.\n\nQ:  I refuse to pay for micro greens in a restaurant.  Just seems wrong.\n\nWhiteman:  But that’s been the major change.  The major change has been, in my opinion, the injection and acceptance of all manner of foreign ingredients into American food and certainly American restaurants, and the way for that was paved by the food and the design magazines that arose out of the increased demand that I began to talk about earlier.  We also became more prosperous, so we could afford to buy these things or experiment with them without feeling that we were going to be beaten to death in our pocketbooks.\n\nQ:  But what happened when we weren’t more prosperous the last time around?\n\nWhiteman:  Last time around that we weren’t prosperous was 2001, and it was then that the goofball in the White House told us to go shopping, which we did.  We just didn’t know we didn’t have the money to go shopping with.  Before that was 1987 was a crash, didn’t last very long.  Most of the recessions have been fairly short.  1982 was a bad one, and a lot of people were out of work.  But the cycles have been pretty short, so the restaurant industry has continued to grow until last year, but it hasn’t changed eating habits.\n\nQ:  What I was wondering about was during those periods, it seemed like, or people write about them as comfort foods came in maybe quickly, left quickly, I don’t know, foods that were more affordable to make and therefore to order in a restaurant.\n\nWhiteman:  Well, meatloaf makes its resurrection every time there’s a downturn in the business cycle, and each time it’s come back with more levels of creativity attached to it and it’s always a little bit fancier.  Macaroni and cheese is the same thing.  What started out as macaroni and cheese became macaroni and cheese with prosciutto, and the next time around it became macaroni and cheese with confit duck.  [laughs]  What you’re seeing right now is gourmet hamburgers in all manner and variations and gourmet hotdogs.  I think they’re both phenomena and that they represent people’s desire to trade down without feeling poverty-stricken, and so they’re trading down at the same time that they’re trading up.  Rather than trading down to a lowly hamburger or a lowly hotdog, you’re now getting—I just saw one the other day, I saw a Chilean hotdog with sauerkraut, mayonnaise, and a huge spritz of guacamole on it.  There’s a guy in Chicago selling confit duck hotdogs with truffle oil.  I’m sorry.  And I have one in my files of somebody who’s taken a hotdog and wrapped it in Monterey jack cheese and wrapped that in a burrito and thrown it in the deep fryer.  So all those are premium hotdogs, so people who are not spending fifty dollars on a steak are saying, “I’m not going to spend two dollars on a hotdog.  I’m going to spend six and treat myself well.”\n\nQ:  Could you tell me the circumstances of how James Beard gave you that book?  Do you remember?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  We were still working together.  We hadn’t opened Windows on the World yet.  We were at a cocktail party for the publishing of this book, which I believe was at The Coach House in Greenwich Village, which no longer exists, and he inscribed the book to me then.  I remember that day.  I’d been having a really hard time with Joe, who was just impossible to work for, and Jim said, “Well, how’s it going?”\n\tI said, “I can’t get this and I can’t get that and I can’t get anywhere with him.  I’m feeling terrible.”\n\tJim was really a mountainous man.  I remember him putting his big hand behind my head and putting my head against his enormous chest and holding it there and saying, “Don’t worry.  It’ll be all right.”  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Did you ever go to dinners at his house or anything like that?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  I used to have a lot of meetings at his house, both houses, because he had one before the one that’s now the James Beard House.  He had one across the street from the Jefferson Market Courthouse, and it was equally bizarre.  [laughs]  He was so big, he just filled up all the space.\n\nQ:  Could you describe what the dinner parties were like there?\n\nWhiteman:  They were really rather simple.  There were not a lot of show-offy things.  People weren’t doing show-offy cooking, and Jim didn’t because his food tended towards being voluptuous and cuddly.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  Yes.\n\nWhiteman:  And a lot of ferment and conversation.  But he wasn’t really so much about doing a tour de force for dinner.  If you asked me what I ate, I couldn’t tell you.\n\nQ:  And the meetings you had there were not accompanied by food?\n\nWhiteman:  No.  Usually something to drink.  I think it was with Jim that I had my first Perrier, not knowing what it was before then.\n\nQ:  But he had been in France and knew.\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  And he had this bizarre electric kitchen, which was part of his cooking school.  Nobody cooked with electricity, except he was being paid by the electric people and had an electric kitchen.  So all these housewives used to come in and have to learn how to push the button in advance.  [laughs]  “In ten seconds, I’m going to have to reduce the heat, so I’ll push the button now.”\n\nQ:  Did you ever go to any of the classes?\n\nWhiteman:  No.  Jim, of course, was highly visible.  You couldn’t sneak anywhere with Jim.  But wherever we went—because he worked with us also at The American Restaurant in Kansas City, where we were consultants, which was a development owned by Hallmark Cards.\n\nQ:  Was it for the Hallmark people?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  You’d have to get to the airport a half hour early if you were with Jim.  Number one, he walked slowly, but, number two, people kept on coming up to him.  You couldn’t get anywhere.  I remember once walking with him from somewhere in Windows on the World to the elevator in order to go downstairs, and three people came up and wanted to say hello.  One woman in particular came up to him and said, “You’re not going to remember me, because it was ten years ago and it was in Detroit, and you were at my house doing something or other.”\n\tAnd he looked at her and said, “I think it was in Grosse Pointe, not Detroit.”  [laughs]\n\nQ:  And he was right?\n\nWhiteman:  And he was right.  And he wore the most crazy combination of patterns and dots and designs.  Nothing matched, but because he was so big, he looked like a multimedia presentation when he walked.  So he was really highly visible.\n\nQ:  How did he get along with Joe Baum?\n\nWhiteman:  Oh, famously.  They’d been friends forever.  I remember once somebody picked him up from a meeting at the World Trade Center.  I guess it was Clay Triplett, but I could be wrong.  And they picked him up in a Volkswagen.\n\nQ:  Oh, my. \n\nWhiteman:  And he had to be squeezed into the front seat of this little thing, and when it drove off, the car was listing to starboard.  [laughter]\n\nQ:  When did Joe Baum die?\n\nWhiteman:  Before 9/11, so it probably would have been, I don’t know, ’99 or maybe 2000.\n\nQ:  Did that change the nature of your business?\n\nWhiteman:  No.  Joe and I went our separate ways some years before that, and we divided the company into Joe having a small share of the consulting company and my having a share of the operating company.  We divided into an operating company and a consulting company.  It was the consulting company that had the contract to redo the Rainbow Room, and it was the consulting company that won the competition to take over and rebuild Windows on the World after the 2003 bombing.  The consulting company turned the operation over to the operating company.\n\nQ:  That’s what I was going to ask you.  But you worked together?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes.  The consulting company got royalties and a big consulting fee from the operating company in order to have it created and put into operation.\n\nQ:  But the company now bears both your names?\n\nWhiteman:  Well, it did then.  I don’t think there’s a Merrill Lynch or a Pierce, Fenner and Smith any longer, but it’s still called Merrill Lynch.\n\nQ:  I see what you’re saying.  They were two different divisions of the same company?\n\nWhiteman:  No.  The operating company had a different set of investors and partners than the consulting company.  The consulting company only had the three of us.\n\nQ:  So what kinds of projects do you have now on the boards?\n\nWhiteman:  Today I’m doing five restaurants in a hotel in Chandigarh, which is the capital of Punjab in northern India.  I’m working on the master plan for mixed-use development in San Antonio that will have about 60,000 square feet or so of food space.  I don’t know what that food space is yet, except that part of it will be a public market, and the rest will be various restaurants once I figure out what the demand and the criteria is going to be.  And we’re working on the food program, a new 60-million-dollar skate house for winter and summer in Prospect Park here.  Oh, there’s an example.  I’m doing that for nothing because they don’t have any budget.\n\nQ:  It’s a skate house?\n\nWhiteman:  There is a Wollman Skating Rink, ice skating rink, in the park right now.  That’s going to be demolished, and a new skate house, big skate house, is going to be built with two rinks, one for ice hockey, one for regular ice skating, and then one will convert to roller skating in the summer, so it will be a year-round attraction.\n\nQ:  Where, compared to where we are right now?\n\nWhiteman:  We can walk to it in about twenty minutes from here.\n\nQ:  Is it a larger company now?\n\nWhiteman:  No, it’s smaller.  Joe died.  One of our other partners retired when he turned sixty-five.  So now it’s me and Rosanne, and it’ll probably never get any bigger.  We don’t chase after a lot of work.  It comes and it keeps us busy enough.  I’m now seventy-one, so I don’t necessarily want to spend all my life, all my time of the rest of my life, working, although I’d like to work for the rest of my life, and, again, if the projects are interesting.  So I give four or five speeches a year.  I write three or four articles a year for Food Arts magazine.\n\nQ:  Describing where you think things are going or what?\n\nWhiteman:  Yes, or something that interests me.  Then we do two or three large consulting jobs a year, and that’s more than enough.  I will never again operate a restaurant, ever.  [laughs]\n\nQ:  So the journalism background didn’t hurt after all, though, if now you’re writing.\n\nWhiteman:  No, the journalism didn’t hurt at all, nor did the graduate work in economics, and neither had anything to do with writing journalistically.  It had to do with the ability to put together a project and describe it to a client as part of a written document, so the programs that we wrote and continue to write bear no resemblance to any other consultant’s programs in terms of their language, their structure, and what they bring from the outside to a project.\n\nQ:  What is the difference between theirs and yours?\n \nWhiteman:  Well, a typical consultant company’s program document for a project is usually a format into which they plug the language and the words in and the concept, but they’re all the same.  Ours are far more complex, and each one is written in a completely different manner, depending on the project.\nI should mention along the way that until this year we had created more New York Times three-star restaurants than anybody.\n\nQ:  Oh, no kidding.\n\nWhiteman:  Got tied this year by Danny Meyer.\n\nQ:  So those three-star restaurants were?\n\nWhiteman:  The three-star restaurants were the Rainbow Room on top of Rockefeller Center; the Market Bar and Dining Rooms; the Cellar in the Sky in the World Trade Center; Aurora, which is a three-star aesthetic triumph that we had on East 49th Street, the tax loss for which I still carry forward.  [laughter]  And the Hudson River Club, which closed after the 9/11 disaster, in the World Financial Center.\n\nQ:  I suspect there may be additional ones.\n\nWhiteman:  You never know.\n\nQ:  Thank you.  This has been a lot of fun.\n\n[End of interview]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tWhiteman - 1 -  PAGE 1\n\n\n\n"}
