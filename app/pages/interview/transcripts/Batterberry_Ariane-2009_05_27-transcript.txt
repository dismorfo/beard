Interviewer:  Judith Weinraub					        New York City

Date:  May 27, 2009

Q:  It’s May 27, 2009.  I’m Judith Weinraub.  I’m with Ariane Batterberry, in the offices of Food Arts magazine.
Thank you for talking to me.  Good afternoon.

Batterberry:  Good afternoon.

Q:  Could we start by your telling me a little bit about when and where you were born and something about your parents and your childhood?

Batterberry:  I was born on September 18, 1935, in New York City, and was brought up on 67th Street between Madison and Park Avenues.  That means right in the middle of Manhattan.  My parents loved good food, and as I was sort of a late arrival in the family, they’d given up the idea of staying home for me, so I went out with them.  The result was that I was quite acquainted with really great restaurants by the time I was ten or twelve.

Q:  My goodness.

Batterberry:  And I knew what really good food should taste like, not that my mother ever produced any of her own, because she didn’t know how to cook, and our food at home was very, very simple.  But I did know what really great food tasted like by the time I was that age.

Q:  What did your parents do?  What was your father’s occupation?

Batterberry:  My father was a physician and scientist.  He had many patents.  His patents are in biochemistry.  He was the discoverer of procaine penicillin, which is the way in which penicillin can be given in large doses to human beings, so it was a really major breakthrough, which he made in 1946.

Q:  How did they happen to go out to dinner so much?

Batterberry:  Well, they just loved good food.  There were very few, though, really good restaurants in New York.  There were two leaders, which was the Pavillon, which was Henri Soulé’s restaurant, and then there was the Colony, which was the other outstanding restaurant.  In fact, when I was in my teens, I think Sirio Macchioni was the maître at the Colony.

Q:  Would you go out exclusively to fine restaurants or neighborhood restaurants as well?  Not that that particular neighborhood was replete with restaurants.

Batterberry:  You know, there were really three kinds of restaurants in New York in those days.  There were the very fine, which were uniformly French cuisine, and that was what fine or expensive cuisine was considered to be.  Then the second category was the little ethnic restaurant, and there were little ethnic restaurants all over New York, with very simple menus.  For example, the menu in every little French neighborhood restaurant was identical with every other, and there were certain things you always found.  For example, there was always a blanquette de veau.  If you were lucky, here was a duck à l’orange.  You would start with one of—you know, carrottes râté or the various simple hors d’oeuvres, tomato salad, whatever, and usually an artichoke offered to begin with.  Then the desserts ran along.  There was a chocolat mousse, there was a crème caramel, and then if there were departures, that was big news.  Mind you, at the great haute cuisine restaurants, there was much more variety, much more invention, but nothing like the invention we have now.
	I remember at the Colony they had a Poire Belle Hélène.  Well, it was the first time I’d ever had chocolate sauce on a pear with ice cream.  I’d had chocolate sauce on ice cream; that you could get in Schrafft’s, which is another category. 
	Anyway, as I said, there were three categories.  The first was haute cuisine and always French.  The second was the little local ethnic restaurant, very often Italian, but it was always southern Italian.  It was red sauce Italian.  The third was a form of restaurant that exists, that you find much less now, which was the sort of ladies’ tearoom-type restaurant, and into that category I think you could put Schrafft’s, in a way, which was a chain of tearoom-type restaurants.  To my recollection, no wine or spirits were served.  There was a lovely lunch of salads with ice cream or layer cake or something of the sort for dessert.
For dinner you’d have rather simple things like a leg of lamb with potatoes.  You might start, believe it or not, with a fruit cup.  I know that may sound horrifying now, but in those days there was always a fruit cup offered as a first course, and a few other things, soup, and you had a choice between perhaps a fruit cup and a soup to begin with.  I always chose the fruit cup, so I’m not an expert on the soups.  Then you would have a main course, which would be a piece of meat with potatoes and vegetables, and then dessert.
The desserts were, I feel, in many ways better than they are now in many places, because they tended to be good, old-fashioned American desserts, all kinds of different layer cakes.  You’d have what was called a cottage pudding, which is just a lovely slice of cake with chocolate syrup, but chocolate sauce, and usually pretty good, on top.  That sort of thing.  At Schrafft’s you could have an ice cream cupcake, which was a nice white or yellow cupcake cut in half, with ice cream in the middle and chocolate or butterscotch sauce on the top.  Always butterscotch in those days.  Caramel was unknown here.  That’s the sort of thing.  And those were very simple, as I say, tearoom-style places.  Schrafft’s was the only chain of that sort.

Q:  You went to all these different kinds of places with your family?

Batterberry:  With my parents, it was mostly the very good places.  On the other hand, the tearoom sort of place is where I would go.  My parents rarely went, but it’s where I would go on what used to be called cook’s night out or when something wasn’t going on at home, so I had to eat out.  I had a governess, so I’d eat at one of the tearoom-style places.  When I was a little older, my teens, I went out to lunch with my friends, would be, of course, in the tearoom-type places.  The little ethnic restaurants, they were mostly dinner, and when you were a little more grown up, if you had a boyfriend, that would be definitely where you went.
	This rather simple pattern continued right up until the sixties, and I think what broke it was—and I know Michael [Batterberry] feels the same way—in the sixties, suddenly there was a great deal of interest—I should say before that, there was a growing interest, thanks to people like Julia Child, in better food at home.  So the magazines were getting better, people were expecting better food at home, and as there were less and less domestic servants, you had more and more people who were college graduates who were doing their own cooking.  This wasn’t necessarily what happened earlier.

Q:  Did you have someone cooking at your home?

Batterberry:  When I was a child, yes.

Q:  What kinds of food?

Batterberry:  Well, our cook was black and she was from Norfolk, and it was mostly what you would call southern cooking, and her specialty was fish.  My parents were very fond of her food, but it was simple.  But by the time I was at college, most families didn’t have help.  I was the baby, so when I was the baby off to college, my parents ate much less at home.  They didn’t have at-home dinners so much.  I guess we still did, and that would be into the middle 1950s.  I’m just trying to remember clearly.
My grandmother would cook every once in a while.  She was a perfectly terrible cook, but she liked kosher cooking and she would only eat kosher food, for reasons it’s hard to figure out, because she wasn’t at all religious.  So she would do her own cooking, and she’d be cooking away, and she didn’t like Rachel’s food and Rachel didn’t like her food.  They were both cooking away there.  But Grandma mostly cooked for herself, as I remember.

Q:  Did she live with you?

Batterberry:  Yes, but we had a big house, so there was room for everybody, but she would cook for herself and she would give me every once in a while a piece of her pot roast, which I loved, but it was so greasy.  As our Mayor Koch said, if you ate that today, it would kill you.  [laughter]
But those were the days when really, I should add, the sort of health notions that have become popular currency did not exist.  On the other hand, my father was a scientist, so we ate well in terms of health in our house, and he was a great believer that over a certain age, it was better to have more fish in your diet than red meat.  He was among the first to ever say that, and that was his idea back in the early forties.  So we had fish quite often, prepared by Rachel at home, and we went to fish houses.  That was another thing.  A favorite place of my father’s was something called King of the Sea, which was a big fish house, not inexpensive, but very good.  But there were not a lot of great seafood restaurants either, and that was a whole other category.  We never went out to steak houses because I think my father felt that he himself shouldn’t be eating steak.  I could always order steak and he thought it was fine for me, but not for him.

Q:  Did you get dressed up?

Batterberry:  To go out?

Q:  Yes.

Batterberry:  If I was going out with my parents, yes, I did.  Otherwise, I didn’t, no.

Q:  But was it unusual for a little girl to be with her parents in these restaurants?

Batterberry:  Yes, probably it was.  I never noticed because my concentration was totally on the food.  But come to think of it, that’s probably why they took me along, because instead of being a nuisance or difficult to deal with, I was concentrating so totally on the food, that I’m sure I was very well behaved without even bothering to think about it.  A child who concentrates on food is always well behaved in a restaurant.  [laughs]

Q:  What about your schoolmates?  Did they have any experiences like this?

Batterberry:  Not the way I did.  Some of them had people cooking at home; others didn’t.  Actually, some of my best friends had mothers who were terrific cooks.  I have one friend, in fact—you asked now, and I was going to say most not, but I had one friend who loved good food the way I did, and her mother was a wonderful cook.  She and I, we had one or two restaurants that we discovered.  In fact, a little French restaurant.  Now you’re reminding me, and I hadn’t thought about this in years.  But there was a little French restaurant called the Canari d’Or, and Barbara Fox—well, her name now is Barbara Fox, but her name was Barbara Weil then.  Barbara and I would go there for lunch if we could, and it was a little French restaurant.  We went there as early as when we were six or seven years old.

Q:  Oh, my.

Batterberry:  We loved the food there, and our mothers would take us or my governess would take us, or whoever, but we could have perfectly well have gone alone, because we knew exactly what we wanted to order and what we wanted to do.  They had a wonderful cheesecake, and I think when we were eight or nine, we got the recipe for the cheesecake and tried to reproduce it at home, but neither of us had any cooking talent whatever, so the result was not brilliant.  But I’ll tell you who did reproduce that cheesecake.  It was white and creamy.  It was not the usual delicatessen cheesecake; it was quite less deep.  It had a graham cracker crust.  And it was much later reproduced exactly, not that they stole the recipe from that restaurant, but Sara Lee, when they first came out with that cheesecake, that was their cheesecake.  But we had the recipe when we were little girls, from this little French restaurant.  So I don’t think Sara Lee stole that particular recipe.  It must have been a specifically French kind of cheesecake.  But I have to say I never found it in France.

Q:  What kind of food did you have at school, growing up?

Batterberry:  School food, which is dietician-chosen school food.  Not good.  [laughs]  But I don’t think anybody—I can’t imagine anybody has any great recollections about school food.  Much later, I went to Cambridge University in the late 1950s, when the food was magnificently terrible, sort of notably terrible.
I’ll tell you the only place had decent food in my educational history was at Barnard.  I took a degree at Barnard.  Now, Barnard had a cafeteria with quite good food.  That was the best institutional food, and I’m talking about Barnard in the 1950s.  So nobody else is ever going to recall Barnard’s food in the 1950s, so I might as well go on record.  It was really quite good.

Q:  Do you have any idea why?

Batterberry:  I’m sure I know why.  I’m sure the ladies on the board at Barnard insisted on decent food, you know.  It’s interesting.  It was definitely better than Columbia.  I occasionally had lunch across the street.  I preferred Barnard, and I’m sure it had to do with the fact that it was a women’s college.

Q:  When you went abroad to study, did you have any idea that you might cook for yourself or you’d just eat what was available or what?

Batterberry:  I realized early on that I had no talent for cooking.  You know, you have it or you don’t.  My husband loves to cook and he’s so talented, and he can just put anything together and make it taste good.  He has a real genius, and he was recognized by Jim Beard.  Did he tell you that Jim Beard said he was the best cook in America who was not in a professional kitchen?  Which was high, high compliment there.  Needless to say, it’s made our marriage very easy, the fact that I don’t go into the kitchen and compete with him in any way.  But as I realized early on, there was no possibility I was going to be a good cook, number one, and I was a student in those days, I never lived anyplace where you could cook for yourself.  When I was at Cambridge, I was in digs, which was an ice-cold room in the home of a very nice woman who would cook a lovely Sunday lunch for us, knowing we were being starved the rest of the week, which we weren’t, actually.  We filled in with heavy breakfasts and huge teas, which we’d stuff ourselves with, crumpets covered with butter.  It was all not a healthful diet.  [laughs]
	As I said, when I was young, there wasn’t really, in those days, the possibility of cooking for yourself.  When I was at Barnard, I lived at home, and at Cambridge nobody had cooking facilities at all, but you were supposed to have dinner in the hall.  You didn’t need to show up for your classes or the lectures, but you absolutely had to show up for dinner at hall.  I think that was required just to show you were there and hadn’t gone off anyplace.  You were supposed to have lunch in hall as well, so you had lunch and dinner at your college, even if you did nothing else.  They also kept an eye on you.  Of course, for the girls it was totally unnecessary, but I think it was a way of keeping an eye on the boys, to be sure they were sober.  [laughs]  Anyway, for the boys this was much more difficult, you had to be in for both lunch and dinner, stone cold sober.  That was the rule of the university.

Q:  What were you studying?

Batterberry:  Classics, Greek and Latin.

Q:  How long did you stay there?

Batterberry:  I took a degree from Barnard, and because I had an American degree, I was able to have a Cambridge degree after only two years out of three.  So I was at Cambridge for two years and Barnard for three years.

Q:  What made you want to do that, to go to Cambridge?

Batterberry:  I loved Cambridge.  I used to go with my father when he went to meetings at the Faraday Society, so I always wanted to go to Cambridge for postgraduate work, and that’s what I did, although it’s not postgraduate there.  You have to take an undergraduate degree, which turns into a master’s after five years with the payment of five  pounds.

Q:  How unusual.  That’s the way it worked.

Batterberry:  That’s the way it worked.  Exactly.  I think they felt that you couldn’t call yourself a master of anything until you’ve reached a certain age or level of maturity.  Anyway, they figured five years after leaving Cambridge, you’ve been through enough to get a master’s, no matter what you were doing.  [laughs]

Q:  What did you do when you came back to the States?

Batterberry:  I was interested in eating.  I didn’t realize at the time, I felt eating couldn’t really be a career, however interested I was in food.  So I worked very briefly for Random House.  But I want to say one thing which I think will be interesting for all oral histories.  When I came back from Cambridge, I basically had the same education as a Rhodes scholar, a man.  The only jobs I was ever offered were secretarial, and in those days, that’s all you could be.  I think organizations like Time-Life, the most you could be was the fact checker.  That was the top.  The jobs were all secretarial, without exception, and after about a year as a secretary, I figured I could work briefly putting together definitions in a dictionary.  But all these would be gone over by a man who would actually know better.  So the opportunities were very small.
However, it was suggested to me just the year I got back from Cambridge that a publisher wanted a history of art for children, and I thought that was something I really could do very well because my specialty at Cambridge had been classical archeology, which is art history, and I’d taken a lot of art history at Barnard.  I realized that there was a great need, because there was no history of art written specifically for children.  I think a lot of parents wanted their children to know what art was, to be able to go to a museum and not be totally ignorant.  I felt it would have a great market.
When I heard that this publisher was interested, I immediately sat down and wrote a couple of chapters and a proposal.  What happened was, the publisher who wanted it had changed his mind.  He had, in fact, asked somebody else to do it and then it had failed, whatever, and he’d changed his mind.  Meanwhile, I decided that this was a really good idea, and I must have gone to about thirty other publishers over a period of about seven years.  I kept taking this idea around.  During that time, I completed the book.

Q:  That’s amazingly entrepreneurial.

Batterberry:  When you were a woman in those days, you had not much choice.  You either were entrepreneurial or you were a secretary.  I mean, a third possibility didn’t really present itself.  So as I say, I took it around to thirty different publishers over a long period of time and they kept turning me down, but I kept reminding myself that Beatrix Potter was told by thirty different publishers, “Nobody wants a story about a rabbit.”  Well, thirty publishers said to me, “Nobody wants a history of art for children,” and I kept saying, “Oh yes, they do.”
	Finally, a wonderful editor, Fabio Cohen, who was then at Pantheon, liked the idea and he published it.  Another interesting fact there, again for somebody else’s history, not necessarily my own, I had a friend who had been at Harvard with other friends of mine, named Carter Brown, at the National Gallery.  Well, I was trying to get plates to illustrate my text, which I could rewrite for different sets of plates, and I went to the Metropolitan Museum, and they were going to charge me something like $300 a plate, and I needed 100 plates for my book, something like that.  Obviously, that was completely prohibitive, so I didn’t know what to do.  I had a publisher, but the publisher didn’t have the money to pay for all these plates.
	Well, I went to my friend Carter Brown, who was then just the assistant to the director.  He was my age.  We were both in our early or mid twenties.  He was assistant to the director of the National Gallery and he immediately saw what a good idea it was, and he went to the director and said, “If we illustrate this book, and it’s being published by Pantheon, a very good publisher, if we supply the illustrations, a whole generation of children will be brought up on our works of art and will consider us the country’s leader as a museum.  If it’s illustrated with the Met, then the Met’s works will be better recognized than ours.”  And the director could see that, so they gave me the use of the plates free of charge, which made it possible to not only publish the book, but publish it very reasonably.  I think it was six dollars for a big, beautifully illustrated book.  The equivalent would be quite a bit more now, but it still made it affordable, and they sold hundreds and hundreds of thousands of copies, and it was in every school library and I think it still is.  It went on for thirty years selling very, very well, which is an interesting story all on its own, but that’s a different story from food.

Q:  Were you living at home while you were doing this?

Batterberry:  Yes, because in those days, if you were a girl, as opposed to a boy, it was considered perfectly natural to live at home until you were married.  Some girls had their own apartments if they wanted to, but many of my friends were also living at home.

Q:  So you didn’t have to worry about cooking for yourself.

Batterberry:  No.  I never had to worry about cooking for myself, thank goodness.  [laughter]  But if nobody was around cooking, I would just go to a tearoom-type place or someplace small and modest where I’d find a better meal than maybe at home.  But anyway, no, I did a lot of eating out in those days, but not in the very grand restaurants.
But the situation, speaking about restaurants in New York, the sort of breakdown I was speaking about earlier continued right up until the sixties, and I think the big change there was because of the movement in the sixties taught respect for doing manual work, and it was suddenly when young people who could go to college chose to do something else perhaps to learn about cabinet making.  You even had, somewhat later, a prince in England who was a cabinet maker.  Anyway, working with your hands became honorable, especially working with the intent of great excellence.  So, doing beautiful handwork.
It was at that time that there was much more of a focus on the part of young people on cooking, and it became something that young men were interested in as well as women, and suddenly being a chef, I would say by 1970 it became something that was considered interesting or exciting to do.  The big changeover came in the 1960s.  It came that early.

Q:  Let me just take you back a bit.  Before you got married, how much a part of dating was eating out?

Batterberry:  In those days—I will make another social comment.

Q:  Absolutely.

Batterberry:  Young people did not live together if they were not married, and dating was a very formal affair; i.e., you didn’t just hang around.  You might have a group of friends you hung around with and you’d all go out together, but you didn’t just sort of hang around in each other’s houses either, particularly.  What basically you did was you went out on a date, and that meant you went out to dinner.  And I, being a rather forward-thinking girl or maybe just a forward girl, I very often paid for myself.

Q:  Oh, my.

Batterberry:  You could let a young man pay for you, but I always, after a certain point, hated to let anybody spend a lot of money on me.  So I would very often say, “Let’s go dutch.”  In those days, I had quite a number of takers.  [laughter]  In terms of going dutch.  But you did go out, and this is where you’d very often go to the small ethnic restaurants.  They were the perfect dating location.  They were sort of romantic, and the food was adventurous, and they didn’t cost all that much money.  That’s where you’d usually go.  Definitely not to the tearoom-type places.

Q:  When you met Michael, how advanced were you in your writing career?

Batterberry:  I met Michael—we went out quite a while before we were married.  When I met Michael, I really got to know Michael because I’d met him before, but when we, let’s say, started to go out—that would make sense—when we started to go out, I was just about to publish the Pantheon Story of Art for Young People, after seven years of not finding a publisher and then not finding the plates.  I was just about to publish that, yes.  So I was advanced enough to have a book coming out.

Q:  And fairly soon you started to work together.

Batterberry:  Yes, and the first thing we did was—I’m sure Michael explained that to you, but we were going to write a history of restaurants, a history of public dining, and there was going to be a third author, which was Hugh Johnson.  Did Michael mention that?  Well, Hugh was in England, and we could have done it now because of communications, but in those days, sending manuscripts back and forth by post, I mean, it was just not practical, and he had other things he was doing.
	Then when we got into our research, we found such fascinating information about New York, and we realized that a closer focus just on New York would make a really interesting book.  So that’s when we decided to write our history of dining in New York.  But we never would have done this if we hadn’t both grown up in families where food was very important and attention was given to food, and the people who produced very good food were very much respected, all of that.

Q:  That must have been pretty unusual, to find somebody who shared that kind of background and interest.

Batterberry:  Well, you know, people somehow find people who share their interests.  I mean, that’s perhaps one reason why you start going out with one person and then you go on going out with them, and then somebody else you go out with once or twice and, well, there’s just not that much to talk about, I guess.  So I think that people of shared interest tend to get together.

Q:  When you mentioned Hugh Johnson, you met him when you were at school in England?

Batterberry:  No, but I met him through friends, and his brother had been at Cambridge when I was there, but I met him afterwards.  You know what happens when you’re at a university.  You go on seeing your friends after you’re down from the university, and then you meet other people who were perhaps at your university or somewhere similar.  You know, just groups of young people tend to meet groups of other young people.  I think that was always the case.

Q:  Was it through Hugh Johnson that you met James Beard?

Batterberry:  Yes.

Q:  How did that work?

Batterberry:  Well, the thing is this.  Michael and I were going out, and Hugh was a friend of ours.  My memory is not all that clear except that I think what happened—and I don’t know if Michael may remember it more clearly—I think Hugh took us to a cocktail party at Jim’s.  Did Michael—

Q:  I think he said it was a party for a publication of Hugh’s book.  Is that possible?

Batterberry:  I don’t think so.  I don’t think Hugh had a book coming out at that moment, but I could be wrong.  I could be entirely wrong, but I know he took us to a party at Jim’s.

Q:  That was at his townhouse?

Batterberry:  Yes, and after that, we went to numerous parties at Jim’s.

Q:  Do you recall any first impressions of him?

Batterberry:  Well, now, that’s a good question.  Hugh had told me a lot about him.  It was really through Hugh that I became aware of him.  I remember realizing when I arrived at Jim’s that there was a whole food world out there.  I guess I always knew there was, but I hadn’t focused on the fact.  I was still in my twenties; Michael had to have been in his early thirties.  But it was sort of a revelation in that way, and what I remember about the party is it was very, very crowded, not full of young people, but by that time I was not expecting every place to be full of young people.  And he had the little plates.  I remember it was charming and delightful.  I didn’t remember Jim himself, because he was a busy host, all that clearly.

Q:  When you say “the little plates,” you mean people made up little plates?

Batterberry:  At his cocktail parties he was a great believer in having little plates so you could put things down on a little plate, as opposed to having to pick it up and put it right in your mouth.  He always had little plates around.  I have a vague recollection that he wasn’t crazy about hors d’oeuvres.  He sort of liked to have a big ham or something you could carve something off of.  Did Michael say that too?

Q:  No, but other people have mentioned that.

Batterberry:  He used to call them “little doots and dots.”  Did Michael tell you that?  He was a large man, and I have a feeling that a little teeny thing that some hostess would hand him just seemed—in proportion to me, for example, I weighed 104 pounds in those days, but they were sort of out of proportion for Jim Beard, who at that point probably weighed twice what I did or considerably more.  So he always had a certain contempt for hors d’oeuvres.  I don’t know.  Am I wrong?  I don’t think he ever included an hors d’oeuvre in any of his cookbooks, but I could be wrong.  Am I wrong?

Q:  I think so.

Batterberry:  I’m wrong.

Q:  Perhaps not calling it that.  That’s another story.

Batterberry:  Yes.  It wasn’t his sort of thing.

Q:  Were you more sophisticated about the food there than other people may have been?

Batterberry:  No, I doubt that.  I doubt that.  I was more sophisticated about food than most of my contemporaries, but the people there were not my contemporaries by any means, no.  No, not at all.  Not at all.

Q:  You married some years later.

Batterberry:  Yes.  We were married in 1968, but we wrote the book between 1964 and 1968, On the Town in New York.  At that point we thought if we could write a book together, we could stay together, which we have for another forty-one years.  So that worked.

Q:  That’s pretty good.  At what point did you do socializing in the sense that you might invite Jim Beard to your home?

Batterberry:  Michael and I, when we were married, we moved to Paris and we were there between one and two years, a year and six month or something like that.  I’m not sure exactly.  When we came back to New York, already when we were there we’d give little dinner parties, and when we came back to New York, we almost immediately found an apartment, and we started giving dinner parties even before the apartment was furnished.  I remember having guests and sort of sitting on packing boxes and so on.  I’m trying to think.  I guess when we’d been married a year or two, you see, I think we met Jim when Michael and I were going out, before we were married.  Did Michael mention that?

Q:  Yes.

Batterberry:  Yes.  So he was somebody we knew by the time we got married.  I guess shortly after we were married and living in our apartment, we started inviting him over for dinner.  That would be about 1970, 1971.

Q:  Would he come by himself or with friends?

Batterberry:  No, we invited him by himself, so he’d come by himself.  Absolutely.  Do you know, he mentioned in one of this articles coming to our house for dinner.  Did you know that?

Q:  No.

Batterberry:  Oh yes, and I have it.

Q:  Do you remember what the article was about?

Batterberry:  I can send it to you.

Q:  It was about some food item?

Batterberry:  Somebody who was going through material about James Beard found it, and I don’t even know when it appeared.  It was an article or it was an interview with Jim, and he said how much he liked our dinners and one reason was that they were very simple, simple and straightforward, with one main dish, really.  I’ll find the article.
But, no, he would come by himself.  And the thing about Jim was that he was a foodie and he was very appreciative of anything you gave him that he really liked.  He was very appreciative, but he didn’t want to talk about food.  At dinner, he didn’t want to be necessarily with the foodies.  He liked meeting new people.  He had his interests.  He had a tremendous interest in opera, in the arts.  He was really a great spirit in that way, and he was very interested in politics, mostly liberal politics, I would say, definitely.  He was a real Greenwich Village liberal, and he liked to discuss, as I say, politics, matters of the world, gossip, news, anything but food, really.  He didn’t want to go on talking.  I mean, food was his work, but I think his recreation was to talk about anything else.

Q:  But nevertheless, he was older and larger.

Batterberry:  Much older, much larger, yes.

Q:  Were you at all intimidated by that?

Batterberry:  No.

Q:  You were a fairly sophisticated young woman.

Batterberry:  Well, no.  The fact that he was older, I mean, we had a lot of friends who were older for ages, and we always had a sense of who he would enjoy meeting.  I remember once we had friends in New Orleans who just loved great food, and they were coming for lunch and we invited Jim, and they’d sent up a huge crate of crawfish that arrived before they did, and so Michael had prepared the crawfish for them and we, of course, invited Jim.  I think when something exciting like that was happening, that’s when we would make a point of inviting him, but we invited him quite regularly.  The thing is, he was a great guest because he was so interested in everything else.  So if he was with interesting people, he just was having the best time, and he was a great conversationalist and he had very strong and interesting opinions on many matters.  He was generally a terrific guest.  Yes, we did have to figure out how to give him a big comfortable chair, as I could be perching on a little bed, but we had to have something nice and comfortable for Jim.  But he was a relaxed and interested and interesting guest.  He was kind of an ideal guest, you might almost say.

Q:  What decade would this have been?

Batterberry:  1970s and 1980s, but I think 1970s.  I think when he began to be ill, we perhaps invited him less because we knew he was ill and it was more difficult.  He was sort of in and out of the hospital.  And it wasn’t because we didn’t want to have him, but we might not have—I don’t think he was going out a lot.  I remember several times we went just to visit him, and he’d invite us and we’d just be there with him alone, and that was fine with us.  I don’t know, but at a certain point his health made it more difficult for him to go out for dinners in the evening.  But I do remember once, quite late on, that he took us to dinner.  He loved the—what was it called, the Carriage House?

Q:  The Coach House.

Batterberry:  The Coach House, yes, in the Village.  He took us there a couple of times.
I have to say this.  I don’t remember him giving a lot of dinner parties, or if he did, they were buffets.  Did other people tell you that?

Q:  I think so, yes.

Batterberry:  I don’t ever remember going to his house for a sit-down dinner.  Mostly they were buffets or dinner or lunch buffets, but I never remember—and there was no placement.  In other words, I never remember sitting next to somebody and thinking, “Oh yes, Jim wanted me to sit next to So-and-so.”  It was, you know, you picked up a plate and you sat down with whoever you wanted to.  I’m trying to remember the format, and basically I think that was it.  I think other people may have mentioned that.

Q:  Let me ask you.  Michael was talking to me about the Good Living business, with the episode with Jim Beard and Prudhomme and Martha Stewart.  Were you a part of that?

Batterberry:  Oh yes.

Q:  You participated in it as well.

Batterberry:  Oh yes, I was there too.

Q:  You were producers as well.

Batterberry:  Yes, and I was also in the film.

Q:  What were you doing?

Batterberry:  We were both interviewing.  I didn’t think I was particularly good on television, so I don’t know if I would have stuck with it, but for the pilot I was there as well.

Q:  Were there other occasions where you were with him that they were not either social or that particular production?  I guess you had politics in common.

Batterberry:  With whom?

Q:  With Jim.

Batterberry:  When you say with him, in what terms?

Q:  Did you have any other—

Batterberry:  In the media with him?

Q:  Not necessarily.  I just meant did you see him under other circumstances than either at dinners or with this particular production.

Batterberry:  I’m trying to think.

Q:  Not that there would be any reason for you to.

Batterberry:  Not really.  As I say, I’m trying to think if we did.  Well, you know, Michael taught at his school, so that would be under that situation, and once in a while I would come by and pick Michael up, when other times he’d just come home, but we wouldn’t really be visiting with Jim at that time.  No, I think that’s about it, yes.

Q:  What was involved for you, anyway, the change from your working with art history, going into the food world and eventually to Food and Wine and to Food Arts?

Batterberry:  The thing is this.  We had written our first book.  I had written the Pantheon Story of Art, but that was for children.  Our first book, Michael’s first book and the one we wrote together, was On the Town in New York.  Now, the thing is, there was a big lacuna between when we finished the book and when it was actually published.  We were already finished in 1968, but it wasn’t published until ’74, because, for one reason or another, at that point we had a contract with Random House, but then they didn’t want to publish it, and it was because in the early seventies, New York was not in great condition, so we had to find another publisher.  Meanwhile, we were writing other books.  So the art histories, our art history series, was published actually before On the Town in New York, but On the Town in New York was written before they were.

Q:  That took in the restaurants and nightlife from how far back?

Batterberry:  On the Town in New York was a history from 1776 to really 1976, except it came out in ’74, but we figured really we were bringing it out sort of for the Bicentennial.  In fact, it’s because of the Bicentennial that we did, in fact, in 1974 find a publisher.

Q:  What do you mean?

Batterberry:  Well, the thing is, New York was bankrupt, and for people who were selling books, the various publishing houses said, “Oh, nobody wants a book about New York.”  Suddenly, though, the Bicentennial was coming up and something that went back to 1776 was of interest again, I think, to publishers, and that’s why.  One reason, I think it was a good book too, if I may say, but that’s one reason it was taken on by Scribner’s.

Q:  Let’s go back to restaurants just for a second.  So you came back from Cambridge and eventually you got married.  Did you go out to eat much when you were newly married?

Batterberry:  Well, we would have, but we were on—how can I say?  We had lesser income in those days, and Michael loved to cook, so I have to say when we were first married, Michael cooked every night.  We had wonderful food.

Q:  How luxurious.

Batterberry:  Luxurious, yes.  I’ve been blessed all my life.  I’m very spoiled.  I’ve had wonderful people preparing wonderful food for me.  I don’t know under what star I was born.  [laughs]

Q:  When did you start going out to restaurants more frequently?  When you were involved in Food and Wine?

Batterberry:  Obviously as time went on, we went out more and more often, and of course, once we had Food and Wine, that was our business.  Also I should mention that in writing On the Town in New York, we went to a lot, a lot of restaurants for the last few chapters.  Have you seen On the Town in New York?

Q:  Yes.

Batterberry:  Do you have a copy?

Q:  I have the reissue.  I don’t have the original one.

Batterberry:  When you asked when we were first married, although we couldn’t afford a lot, we were very often invited to restaurants because we were writing about them.  So we continued to go to restaurants, and when we could afford, we went on our own, but we were very often invited.  We had great interviews with fascinating people who aren’t with us anymore, so the book is full of that kind of—in a way, it’s its own kind of oral history, that book.

Q:  One of the things I’m interested in is the role that restaurants play in life now, as it’s progressed over time.  You’ve watched that.

Batterberry:  Oh yes.  There’s been a vast growth just in the number of restaurants.  It never ceases to amaze us, and we’re in the industry.  For example, if you walk up Second Avenue or Third Avenue or Lexington, these avenues are covered—every other storefront is a restaurant, and this goes on for a hundred blocks.  I mean, it’s really absolutely amazing, the sheer number of restaurants.  I think New York is a restaurant city because in places like New York or Chicago or any of the big restaurant cities, people don’t cook at home all that much.  In New York City, I think—well, the young people basically spend their money in restaurants.  I think New York Magazine did a study and found there were young people who said they spent up to 80% of their disposable income on restaurants, and they were able to do this because they would live in apartments sort of six in a two-bedroom apartment, or four at the very least in a two-bedroom apartment.  Well, of course they were on top of each other.  Their escape would be to go to a restaurant.

Q:  That must have been really very different from the role that restaurants played in life when you were growing up.

Batterberry:  Yes.  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Everybody cooked at home or somebody was cooking for them.  You see, there have been a lot of changes that lead to more restaurant-going.  Number one, when I was a child, it’s still a remnant of the era when there was a lot of help, and families, especially with several children, would have a cook.  That was true of a large swath of the middle class.  I’m not just talking about the very wealthy.  I think that came to an end with the Second World War or within ten years after that, and a whole generation of people who would work as cooks were not replaced by another generation doing that.  Some were black, but many were also immigrants from abroad, Russians, Irish, Polish.  There were people of all color and races who came to this country, especially women who didn’t have a lot of training in other things, who’d become cooks.  Well, that ceased to happen because of women’s education and a whole lot of other social situations.  So the domestic cooks sort of disappeared, I guess in the fifties.  So young women had to do more cooking for themselves.
	There was a period—I like to think of it as the Julia Child period—when women who had a college education had very few opportunities, as I had very few opportunities, who would get married and then they’d be cooking, but they were very serious about trying to be accomplished at cooking.  They were, I would say, affluent enough to go out and buy really good products and really concentrate and take enough time to cook a good meal.  I would say it was the period of my own generation, as I wasn’t typical, as we graduated from college but found very few opportunities in the business world, as during the sixties and seventies the opportunities in the business world were multiplying and it was possible—for example, briefly I went to law school.  I was the only girl in my class.  I was at Columbia Law.  There were two girls.  I wasn’t the only one; there was one other in a class of three hundred.  Well, during the period from 1960 to 1980, that was completely flipped, and by the nineties, there were more girls than there were boys.  So you can just see how that would affect the whole thing of cooking at home.  That sort of thing, that kind of business opportunity suddenly appeared.

Q:  Of course, I never really thought about this, but as women made more money, they could afford to go to restaurants without being on dates.

Batterberry:  Exactly.  That’s just it.  Suddenly you had two-income families or you had women who were on their own, earning a good living, who wanted to go home and cook for themselves—it was just too lonely—who would go out with other girls, in a way, Sex and the City.  But it’s emblematic in the fact, what do they do, this group of girls?  They’re always meeting in restaurants.  You see what I mean?  They weren’t married but they weren’t sitting at home.  Well, that began, as I say, as possibilities for women expanded in the sixties and seventies.

Q:  That’s what I was thinking.  Your book went up to ’76, so since then, that’s been a major, major change.

Batterberry:  And we’d have to write a whole other book about everything that’s happened since then.  In fact, Michael wrote the chapter that brought it more up to date for the more recent publication, but he said to really bring it up to date, you’d have to write a whole other book because there’s been such a vast, vast expansion.  But I think what led to it was really the role of women.  So, as I said, there was just a window between the disappearance of the domestic help and the era in which women had more and more opportunity.  And that window, I think, was the 1950s and early 1960s.
	Don’t forget, something I’m very aware of, that a lot of people have forgotten, is that feminism, women’s rights came in in the seventies, not in the sixties.  In the sixties, women were having more and more business opportunities, but not enough for them to really have a movement.  It wasn’t until the seventies there was that movement.  So I think this is what happened.  Looking at the bigger picture, in the sixties you had a development of the feeling that working with your hands and creating something like good food was an honorable, interesting, exciting thing to do, and that affected both men and women.  But women were still in the kitchen, but they were just beginning to come out.
But because of this attention to good food, more and more restaurants were opening that produced good food, because there was just a general interest.  It had a lot to do with people like Julia Child and Jim.  That’s where they were important, right there in the sixties and early seventies, this whole movement to good food.  But don’t forget the whole movement to good food wasn’t necessarily a movement to restaurants, because women were still in the kitchen.  But you had this great growth and an interest in good food and the possibility of men becoming chefs, and the idea that if you were a woman in the kitchen, you’re not supposed to be a drudge; you’re supposed to be producing something really great.  All that was the sixties, the sum of attention to excellence in food.
	Then what happened in the seventies, like the—how could I say?  The other bookend was suddenly in the seventies, women began to really be making money and having interesting jobs outside of the home.  You began to really have the two-income family, and that really gave a big spurt to restaurants.
So it was those two movements, the sixties, general freedom and interest in making food, as it were, and the seventies, where the interest became of major, major importance because women were moving out of the kitchen.
And I’ll tell you something that’s really interesting that I’m sure maybe Michael told you this.  We started Food and Wine in ’78, and we did one of our first demographic studies, but we’d been out for about a year, so we’re talking ’79 or even ’80.  We found that half our readers were men, to begin with.

Q:  Of Food and Wine.

Batterberry:  Yes.  So that was a big revolution right there.  Everybody said you could never have a magazine for men as well as women for the kitchen, and we did.  Half our readers were men.  The average age of our female reader was forty-two, which was exactly the same as Gourmet, and the average age of our men was something like twenty-eight.

Q:  Wow.

Batterberry:  Which meant we had an eighteen-year-old for every thirty-eight-year-old.

Q:  That’s really fascinating.

Batterberry:  Yes.  But that shows you the whole thing.

Q:  New York has obviously been through some tough economic times before right now, and that’s affected restaurants in terms of the kinds of food they were serve and if they would survive.

Batterberry:  Well, you know, the restaurant industry is not doing badly.  I’m sure Michael told you that.  There have been as many openings as ever.  I’m just as behind in going to the new restaurants as I usually am this time of year.  There aren’t that many closings.  There has been a big difference in people ordering less expensive wine.  The check average has gone down, but the seats are just as full.  There have been a lot of—I’m sure Michael mentioned this—a lot of—

Q:  We actually didn’t get into this.

Batterberry:  Well, a lot of prix fixe menus, especially for lunch, under $30 all over the place.  But the restaurants have not gone through a lot of that kind of thing, really.  It’s been a steady growth.  What I was speaking of before, the great influences were always much more important than whether this year the stock market was up or it was down.  In the seventies, it was still growing, even though the city was in trouble.
The one big, big thing that affected restaurants that was political and financial was Prohibition.  That was a restaurant killer, and there’s never been anything remotely like that.  I mean, that just closed everything, because they couldn’t make enough money.  So that just killed off a whole generation of restaurants, and nothing vaguely like that has happened since.  Nothing.

Q:  So how do you see this situation developing?

Batterberry:  I think things are fine.

Q:  You think they really are fine.

Batterberry:  Yes, and they’re getting better.  I mean, just up in a little restaurant in Rhinebeck, New York, but it’s the hangout, and the owner said he had a bad January, February, and March, and a bad December, January, and early February, but then after Valentine’s Day it all picked up and now it’s great.

Q:  That’s phenomenal.

Batterberry:  Yes.

Q:  You will obviously have to write another book that takes us from ’77 on to now.
