Interviewee:  Marion Nestle 						        Session #2

Interviewer:  Judith Weinraub					        New York City

Date:  May 26, 2009

Q:  It’s May 26th.  This is Judith Weinraub.  I am with Marion Nestle in her office at New York University, and we are about to start our second interview.
Good afternoon.

Nestle:  Good afternoon.

Q:  When we talked the other day about your experience on the Surgeon General’s Report, it sounded as though you were so overwhelmingly busy most of the time that the implications of what you were doing didn’t hit you full in the face and politicize you at that time because it was just too much to process all at that time.

Nestle:  Yes, I think that’s the case, and I didn’t really begin to get involved in these kinds of things until I was at NYU for a couple of years.  When I was invited by C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon general, to speak at a meeting that he was running in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute about behavioral causes of cancer, and by that he was talking about cigarette smoking and diet, and I was one of the two diet speakers.  The other was Jane Brody.  But I had never heard what I call the anti-cigarette mafia speak before.  I didn’t know them.  This was an international group of people who devoted careers to anti-smoking, and they gave talks that were beautifully illustrated with photographs—they were slides in those days—photographs of cigarette advertising in remote areas of the world, in the remote villages of the Himalayas, the jungles of Africa.  I mean, anyplace that you could think of in really poor areas all over the world, there was cigarette advertising, and I had never noticed it before.  I mean, I’ve traveled and I had been to some of those places, and I wasn’t looking for cigarette advertising.  I didn’t see it.
	And then there was a speaker, John Pierce, who’s now at the University California, San Diego, who gave a similar talk, but it was about marketing to children, marketing of cigarettes to children, and here it was advertisements to children, it was largely Joe Camel during that period, of the stores that were near schools, sports facilities, everyplace, music, places where kids might be, slide after slide after slide, and at the end of it, I was just stunned by it.  It was such a powerful visual image of really crass commercial marketing of cigarettes to children.  There was no doubt that this stuff was being marketed to children.
And I turned to Jane Brody and said, “You know, we ought to be doing this for Coca-Cola,” and that was it.  That was it.  After that, I started noticing, and so I began to notice.  I started taking pictures.  I started keeping notes, and began writing about these kinds of things, particularly—I think I started with soft drink pouring rights, contracts.  I went to a meeting near Albany of school food service directors, and somebody asked a question after my talk, what did I think of the pouring rights contracts.  “What are pouring rights contracts?”  I’d never heard of it.  And they explained what they were, and I was so visibly shocked at the idea that school districts would have exclusive contracts with one or another soft drink purveyor to sell that soft drink in the school, that people could see that I was an open vessel.  And before I left that meeting, I had a pile of documents that people at the meeting gave me, including copies of contracts with school districts and the prototype contract that was produced by the state education department as a way to raise money for schools.
	So I wrote an article about soft drink pouring rights in schools.  I did another one on marketing to children in Public Health Reports, and there were some others in between, and by the time the late 1990s came around, I had a bunch of articles under my belt about various issues in which commercial interests influenced federal policy or state policy about nutrition one way or the other.

Q:  When did you make that particular connection, the federal policy?

Nestle:  Oh, that actually came earlier.  In the early 1990s I started writing articles about the history of dietary guidelines and the history of dietary guidance policy, and I wrote a—oh, I had forgotten about that.  Right when I first came to NYU, someone that I had known at—oh, I was interviewed by Malcolm Gladwell at the Washington Post, because the Department of Agriculture had just withdrawn its Eating Right pyramid.  This was 1991.  They had just withdrawn the pyramid, saying that it hadn’t been tested on low-income women and children.  I was interviewed by Malcolm Gladwell, who was then writing for the Washington Post, and I said something like, “Oh, good grief.  Not again.”  I mean, the history of dietary guidance is replete with such examples of corporate interference, particularly the meat industry, interference with dietary guidelines of one kind or another, and I was quoted in the Washington Post as saying some rude comment about what had just happened.
And that night at about eleven-thirty at night, I got a call from a staff person at the Department of Agriculture saying, “I saw your quotation.  We’re in a very difficult situation.”  This was a nutritionist at the Department of Agriculture.  She said, “We’ve been told that we can’t talk to the press, and we’re not allowed to talk about this at all, but I have documents that can prove that the reasons that the secretary is giving for withdrawing the pyramid are not true, and that, in fact, this is being done because of pressure from the Cattlemen’s Association.  I have documents that will prove it, and I have copies of the before and after, and I have documents that will demonstrate that this was a completely public transparent process for the last twelve years, and it’s gone through all Department of Agriculture clearances, and I have documents to prove it.  Could you get them to the press?”

Q:  Wow.

Nestle:  And I said, oh, I thought I could probably do that.
And the next day I got a FedExed package, and then I started getting documents sent to me through faxes from public fax machines, hotel rooms and stuff.  I just called Marian Burros and said, “Do you want this stuff?”  Marian wanted it.  Imagine that.

Q:  Maybe this would be a good time just to insert something about the dual nature of the Department of Agriculture, to give it some context.

Nestle:  Sure.  Well, I mean, what happened, what Marian did in her articles, she really was like an attack dog on that particular incident, because it was such a perfect example of conflict of interest at the Department of Agriculture, which, on the one hand, is supposed to be advising the public about diet and health, and, on the other hand, is supposed to be promoting American agricultural interests, which means the interests of large cattle producers.  And so it just came right in the middle of that.  And there were a lot of reasons why it happened.  There was brand-new secretary of agriculture, who didn’t know diddlysquat about what was going on, and hadn’t been involved in the process and didn’t realize that it had gone through all these clearance procedures.
And, in fact, it was at the printer.  It was at the printer having its color adjusted.  I mean, it was ready to go, and to have it withdrawn, it was such a crass example of conflict of interest.  So then lots of reporters wrote about it, but Marian in particular just stayed on it, stayed on it, and stayed on it, and finally blew the whistle at the whole thing about a year later.  They redid the research, and she blew the whistle on the research.  She had actually deduced from things that people told her what the replacement of the pyramid was likely to look like, and it was published in the New York Times, and so embarrassed the Department of Agriculture that they had to back off.  Now, this was another example of Mike McGinnis’ skillful work, because he was the one who brokered that deal.

Q:  With whom?

Nestle:  He got the Department of Agriculture to agree to release the pyramid.  That was my understanding of how that happened, that the Department of Health and Human Services stepped in and negotiated a way out of it so there was some face-saving, but eventually the pyramid was released. 
	So I had all this inside material on it because it had been sent to me, and, you know, I mean, there were amazing things that happened during that whole process.  Newsweek called one day and said, “We understand you have color graphics of the original pyramid.”
	And I said, “I don’t, actually.  I have black and white Xerox copy.”
	And then he said, “I understand that you can get color graphics.”
	And I said, “I don’t really know how I can do that.”
	And he said, “We understand that you can do it, and we need them.”  So I made a couple phone calls, and talked to people at the PR agency.

Q:  The PR agency that was working on the—

Nestle:  That was working on it.  It was Porter Novelli at the time.
And I said to the person that I talked to, “You and I are going to have a very weird conversation, and I just want to warn you that this is coming.”  And I said, “Newsweek wants a copy of the color graphic of the original pyramid.”
And the guy at the other end was just completely shocked.  He said, “We can’t do that.  We can’t give this to Newsweek.”
I said, “I’m not asking you to give it to Newsweek.  I’m asking you to give it to me.”
And he said, “I’ll have to think about it.”  And so he hung up the phone, and an hour later I got a phone message saying, “The object that you requested will be at the Four Seasons Hotel in Georgetown at the concierge’s desk at noon.”

Q:  Goodness.

Nestle:  So I called back Newsweek, and said that’s where it’ll be, and Newsweek published it, and then they sent me the slides.  So I have those slides.  I have them.
	So I had all this fabulous illustrative material, and I used it in an article that I wrote for a now defunct history journal.  So that article was there.  There was a history of dietary guidelines policy, a history of the pyramid, there was the article on marketing to children and on pouring rights, and I just added in a couple of others, and that was Food Politics.

Q:  But meanwhile, what were you teaching here at that time?

Nestle:  The department was Home Economics and Nutrition, then it was Food, Nutrition and Hotel Management, then it was—I mean, it kept changing its name and evolving until 1996, when we invented food studies and that whole business came in.  I was chairing the department so I wasn’t teaching much, but I usually taught one class a semester and ran the doctoral program.  So I taught whatever was needed, community nutrition, nutrition and public health, I mean, whatever.

Q:  So did you have a chunk of time that you could afford to devote to this?

Nestle:  It was piecemeal.  I had a sabbatical coming up, and the origin of Food Politics was I had a sabbatical and I needed a project for it.  So I thought, “Well, I’ll just put these essays together into a book,” and of course it got completely out of hand and took a couple more years to do.  It came out in 2002.  Actually, it came out in 2002 and 2003 because the manuscript was so long they split it into two books, and one was Safe Food and the other was Food Politics.

Q:  Oh, I see.  Is that how that worked?  I see.

Nestle:  That’s how that worked.

Q:  Interesting.  Did you become angrier as you gathered together this material, or was it what you expected to find or what?

Nestle:  Well, I knew it was there and I was looking for good examples, and there was no lack of examples of corporate influence on nutrition policy of one kind or another.  I mean, there were plenty of examples.  It was just a question of which ones to choose and which ones to write about, and some of them I wrote about in greater length than others.  But the core of the book is the material that I had already been working on for some number of years.  And I was particularly eager to have the pyramid chapter in there because that chapter had been plagiarized by somebody else and published in somebody else’s book, and I wanted to reclaim it.  So that was one of the reasons.

Q:  It had been stolen?

Nestle:  Yes.  A colleague at the University of Maryland had asked me to send her copies of my papers, and she took the pyramid one and reproduced it almost word for word.

Q:  Oh, my god.

Nestle:  Pretty amazing, without much attribution.  So I got my revenge.  I was asked to review her book a couple of times and dealt with that, and then I use her plagiarized version as a case study in plagiarism.  So we teach plagiarism from it here.  I wasn’t going to sue or take her to court or anything like that.  It would have done me no good whatsoever, but I wanted to reclaim that article as my own.  So that was part of the reason for putting that in there.  Also, it’s a great story.  The pyramid story is a great one.

Q:  Did this experience change the way you saw your role, the way you saw what you were doing?

Nestle:  No.  Food Politics did.

Q:  Yes, that’s what I meant, actually.

Nestle:  I had three motivations for writing Food Politics, aside from the business of having a sabbatical and needing a project to fill that, and I thought by that time I needed a book.  I was trained in a field in which books don’t count, only articles count, but at NYU books count, and I could see that it was time for a book.
But besides that, I had three goals for writing it.  One was I wanted better lecture invitations.  You have to be careful what you ask for.  Another was I really—I mean, the real reason for doing it was that I wanted to change the conversation.  Every meeting that I went to about childhood obesity in the late nineties talked about parental responsibility, and nobody was talking about food marketing.  I wanted that to change.  I did not ever want to go to another meeting about childhood obesity without people talking about what food companies were doing to market to kids, and, you know, Food Politics achieved that.  It really did.
And then the third reason was I wanted the American Dietetic Association to stop publishing corporate-sponsored fact sheets about nutrition issues.  They’re still doing it.  Can’t win them all.

Q:  Give me an example of that.

Nestle:  Monsanto is the sponsor—well, I’ll name the topic and you tell me who the sponsor is.

Q:  I’m sure I couldn’t, but go ahead, unless it’s blueberries, but go ahead.

Nestle:  I’m sure you could.  Sugar.

Q:  I guess there’s a sugar association, Florida Sugar Association.

Nestle:  There certainly is.

Q:  Yes, I see.

Nestle:  Soft drinks.

Q:  PepsiCo.  I don’t know.

Nestle:  Yes.  Right.

Q:  I see.

Nestle:  So that’s how it works.  And they’re written by the corporation’s public relations people, and they’re vetted by the American Dietetic Association, but not much.  I don’t think they should be doing that, but they still are.  So you can’t win them all.
	But certainly the big win was the conversation changed, and now everybody talks about marketing to children, and it’s a huge, huge, huge issue for food corporations that sell products that are aimed at kids.  So I think Food Politics had a lot to do with that, and I’m pretty proud of that.

Q:  Did it change the kind of student at all that was coming to NYU to this department?

Nestle:  Well, it improved interest in our public health nutrition program, but by that time there was food studies.  I understand that my being here is a big draw for students in a way that’s not really fair, because I hardly meet any of the students.  I teach one class a semester, and I don’t usually have more than twenty-five students in them.  So I don’t get to meet very many of the students who come through the department, but I understand it’s a draw.  But you’d have to ask other people about that.

Q:  What kind of courses do you teach actually here?

Nestle:  Well, I’m teaching nutrition for food studies this semester.  I try to teach things that cross at least two of three fields in the department, and last semester I taught nutrition and public health.  Next semester I’m teaching food sociology.

Q:  What is food sociology?

Nestle:  Well, it’s going to be food as a social movement, is the way I’m going to do it, I think, and have them read contemporary books that are pushing food as a social movement.  There’s lots of books.

Q:  During the period of time that the department was developing, did you have a role in focusing how the department—I mean, you must have.

Nestle:  Well, I was chairing.

Q:  That’s what I meant.

Nestle:  I chaired the department from 1988 to 2003, and we started food studies in 1996.  The public health came in in 2002, and that’s when everything fell apart and I stepped down as chair.

Q:  But until then, how did you see the subject developing in a way that it was relevant to the public at large?

Nestle:  Well, we have courses in food policy that are required for some of the curriculum.  We were teaching food studies.  We were doing all of these things.  There’s not a large population of students who are interested in doing what I do.  It’s a small niche.  The students who come here come here for many different reasons, but a lot of them are interested in food as—certainly the food studies people are interested in food as a social movement.

Q:  In terms of Food Politics, in the book where you discuss the fact that nobody would talk to you on the record, I found that really fascinating.  Is that because they were employed by the government?

Nestle:  Or food companies or health organizations that get funding from food companies.

Q:  But why then were they, in fact, willing to talk to you?  Were they distressed about the way things were going?

Nestle:  Yes.  People will always talk; they just don’t want to get into trouble.  It’s easy to get people to talk.  That’s not a problem.  You know, Watergate taught us that.  They just don’t want to be identified.  I could understand that.  I couldn’t get anybody to talk to me on the record.  I mean, even when people said they would, they backed off.  The same thing was true of the pet food book, exactly the same thing, Pet Food Politics.

Q:  Explain how that happened.  What kinds of people were you trying to reach?

Nestle:  Well, I was trying to talk to people in pet food companies or government agencies or whatever, you know, or the FDA or whatever.  People were perfectly happy to talk to me; they just didn’t want to be quoted.

Q:  Now, here’s a really naïve question, but if people are very distressed about what’s going on where they’re working, how do they face themselves continuing to work where they work?

Nestle:  I can’t answer that question.  They need to make a living.  You know, I’m in a very privileged position.  I mean, look at what’s happening in our society.  I have a tenured job with a salary that’s not enormous, but I can live on it.  It’s a comfortable salary.  I have health benefits.  I have an apartment that I pay half-market rates or less for because I rent it from the university.  I have tenure.  I mean, nobody in our society has tenure anymore.  Nobody does.  This is an enormously privileged position.  I try not to abuse it.

Q:  Did you get the feeling that some people were hoping that somebody would come ask them these questions at some point?

Nestle:  I didn’t have any trouble getting people to talk to me or suggest other things.  I mean, look at what happened at that meeting in Albany, where by the time I left that meeting I had a briefcase full of documents.  People were delighted to have somebody do something with them.  I mean, I’ve never had any trouble getting people to help me with my work, and for things that I think are really crucially important, other people vet them.  Every chapter in Food Politics was read by at least two other people, critically read, somebody in the field and somebody not in the field, every single chapter, and sometimes more than two because I needed that kind of feedback.  So ultimately because there are people who read the whole thing, there were at least four people who read every chapter.

Q:  How long has it been known that the country was producing more food than it needed?

Nestle:  Oh, since the earliest records.  Since the earliest records.  There were 3,200 calories per person per day in 1909.

Q:  You mean accessible calories?

Nestle:  Well, available in the food supply, calories from the first year that the Department of Agriculture began keeping records, and it stayed at 3,200 plus or minus 200 all the way through, with very, very little variation until the early 1980s, when it started to go up.  So there has been an increase of 700 calories since the early 1980s.  But prior to that, it was constant forever.  So there’s always been a huge surplus of food here.

Q:  And at what point was the awareness public that the food companies had to do something to sell that available food?

Nestle:  Well, they realized it immediately.  I mean, food companies realized it immediately.  There was a really sharp shift in food company marketing practices starting in the early 1980s.  Larger portions is the most obvious manifestation of that.  Lisa Young’s work, my former doctoral student, she went out and measured, actually did a historical study of when large-sized portions began to be introduced into the food supply, and it was right in the early 1980s when the calories starting going up.

Q:  And large portions meant both in the kinds of things that you get in supermarkets and in fast food places?

Nestle:  It’s everything.  It’s absolutely everything, but the most obvious example was muffins.  I was in Washington, D.C. when Michael Kinsley wrote an article about the attack of the killer muffins, and they had gone from being little 200-calorie muffins to being 500 or 600 calories.  Well, you eat that, you’re eating three times as many calories.  You know, larger portions have more calories.
And then the other ways in which food companies started marketing was that food started going in in places where it had never been before.  The soft drink pouring rights contracts were an example of that.  You put vending machines, as many vending machines in schools as you possibly can in order to make sure that lots of products get sold from them.  So you make it socially acceptable to eat in all places at all times.  My famous question, when did it become okay to eat in bookstores?  You know, when I came to NYU in 1988, there were very, very clever signs, and I wish I still had them, that were posted all over the library about how you couldn’t eat in the library.  Now there are two cafes in the library.
So, you know, what we know from research that’s been done in the last few years is that larger portions, more frequent eating, closer food availability, number of times a day, all of those encourage people to eat more than they ordinarily would.  So people started getting fat, you know, I think largely as a result of changes in food marketing, and these, in turn, were the result of changes in agricultural policy and in the way Wall Street evaluated firms.
So farm policy changed in the 1970s from paying farmers not to grow food, to paying farmers to grow as much as they possibly could, and then in the early 1980s, Wall Street shifted from valuing corporations for long-term slow returns on investment, blue chip stocks, to higher immediate returns on investment.  And that, I think, put huge pressure on all corporations to produce faster, and therefore to cut corners in order to keep prices low.  And for food companies it was just devastating, because they were already trying to sell food in an environment in which there were twice as many calories as anybody needed, and now they had to grow every ninety days on top of that.  Pretty tough to do.

Q:  When people started working on the last farm bill, did they try and get you involved to do any lobbying for them?

Nestle:  No.  No.  There were lots of other people doing that.

Q:  There certainly were.

Nestle:  I mean, I gave one talk on it.  I was kind of amazed.  It was 1,200 pages and had a table of contents that was seventeen pages long.

Q:  You mean the farm bill?

Nestle:  The farm bill.  I mean, there was no way anybody could possibly understand it.

Q:  Were you at all surprised at the way things turned out?

Nestle:  No.  I was surprised there was any progress at all.  Every single administration that has come in since I’ve been teaching nutrition, which goes back to the mid seventies, has attempted to get rid of farm subsidies, and not a single administration has ever been able to do it, even though they all come in and say, “We’re going to get rid of farm subsidies.”  Clinton couldn’t do it, Bush couldn’t do it, Obama won’t be able to do it either.

Q:  Are any of the students here interested in things like that?

Nestle:  Oh yes.

Q:  But they wouldn’t be working specifically through this department, probably?

Nestle:  Yes, they would be working.  Oh, sure.  Yes.  There are students in the department who are very interested in these things.  They take our classes in food policy.  They’ll take my food sociology class.

Q:  I think what depressed me was that it seemed so unlikely that anything would happen from the beginning, and I would go occasionally to meetings where, you know, a lot of the people working hard and honestly on this would count up minute steps for what that might happen as opposed to—

Nestle:  Well, there were some minute steps that did happen.

Q:  Well, the geographic preference, that was a big deal.

Nestle:  And the organic business, that’s progress.

Q:  Well, tell me how you got from Food Politics to your next books.

Nestle:  Well, say food was part of—

Q: Part of it.

Nestle:  The original manuscript, this is really funny.  I was used to writing articles.  When you write an article, a twenty-five-page double-spaced manuscript is a ten-page paper when it’s published.  So I wrote twenty-five of them.  I thought I had a 250-page paper.  I thought I had a 250-page book, that’s what I thought, and when I turned the manuscript in, my editor had a heart attack.  He said, “Marion, this is a 900-page book.  Not only is it a 900-page book, but it’s got 200 pages of footnotes.  We can’t do this.”
So there was a crisis, the famous Christmas Crisis, where they hired an editor, and the idea was that the editor would go through the manuscript and figure out how to cut it by 40 percent.  That was the idea.  They didn’t tell me that, but that was the idea.  And just before Christmas—and this must have been 2000—the editor sent me a seven-page, single-spaced fax, which was his analysis of the book, and, I mean, I read it and sat on the floor and cried because it was so upsetting.  One of the things in it was maybe I should go to a bookstore and get a book on how to turn a doctoral dissertation into a book that somebody might want to read.  I mean, I was just horribly, horribly offended.
I called my agent, who was at that point at home for Christmas, and she said, “Fax it to me,” which I did, and she called me back and said, “Marion, he’s not being insulting.  He’s really not.  He doesn’t know how to cut your book.”  And I swear to you, I go back and look at that to this day, and I do not know how she got that out of what his letter said.  I really don’t know how she got that.  She said, “You’ve got to call him.  You have to talk to him.”
	So the next day I called him, and the first words out of his mouth, the first words were, “You know, I don’t know how to cut your book.”  He said, “You write really tight.  The material that you have is really good.  I don’t know how to cut it.”  So then we did a conference call with the editor, and that was when it became two books.  So the last ten chapters or so went to Safe Food.

Q:  But that was published first?

Nestle:  No.  Food Politics was published first.  So then it went through an editing process, and the editor was actually very good and I learned a lot from him.  And so Food Politics came out in the spring of 2002, and Safe Food, which was then edited and I completely rewrote it, came out in 2003.

Q:  You completely rewrote it to what end?

Nestle:  Oh, it was not sufficiently coherent in theme.  It needed to be developed much more thematically, as a much more coherent book.  And it’s interesting, I’m reading it now because I’m preparing a new edition of Safe Food, and I must say it holds up quite well, quite well.  And it’s too bad it didn’t come out a few years later because it’s really timely.  Also it needed a much better title, and they wouldn’t let me call it The Politics of Food Safety, which was what I wanted to call it, because they said it was too close to Food Politics.  So it’s called Safe Food, which wasn’t very exciting, and then the Bacteria, Biotechnology, and Bioterrorism subtitle is way too scary and nobody wants to read it.

Q:  It’s a hard one, yes.

Nestle:  Nobody wants to read it.  So the new edition will be called Safe Food: The Politics of Food Safety.  I think it’ll work much better.  I’m going through and correcting errors and doing that kind of thing, and I’ll write a new chapter to update on what’s happened, but really nothing has changed very much.

Q:  Can you talk about the central points of the book?

Nestle:  Which?

Q:  Politics of Food Safety.

Nestle:  Yes.  Half the book is about bacterial food safety and the other half is about biotechnology, and they’re perfect examples of the discrepancy between what I call science-based and value-based ways of looking at food safety.  Science-based food safety looks at the number of cases, hospitalizations, deaths, costs, that kind of thing.  Value-based food safety looks at many other issues besides safety.  They’re interested in control over the food supply and whether it’s technological, whether it’s foreign or familiar, whether it’s something that you understand or can’t understand, and who controls it.
	They’re called ‘dread and outrage factors’ in the risk communication literature, and bacterial food safety doesn’t elicit much dread and outrage in people.  It just doesn’t.  That’s why there’s no national food safety movement, even though these horrible things have happened.  And it doesn’t because everybody gets food poisoning, most people recover.  It’s only if your kid is caught in one of these really bad things that you really get into the dread and outrage mood on that.  Whereas biotechnology which, you know, has not known ever to have hurt anyone, fills people with dread and outrage because it’s technological, under the control of Monsanto, unfamiliar.  People feel like they have no control over it at all.
And then I argue in the book that safety is used as a surrogate.  Everybody is worried about the safety of genetically modified foods, and maybe they’re not safe, you could never prove them perfectly safe, but they don’t create 76 million cases of food poisoning a year.  But it’s really easy to generate dread and outrage about it because there’s something very scary about the idea and foreign about the idea of putting genes from one organism into another, [and having one company control so much of the food supply].
So that’s the major theme that runs through the book, but the stories that I tell in them are about the big food safety problems of the last year, what E. coli is about, why we have these new microorganisms that nobody ever heard of before and how serious they are.  And the biotechnology is really about politics because, you know, you can argue safety until you’re blue in the face, but there really isn’t much to go on.  But one of the reasons why the people who are involved in biotechnology are so upset about the fact that the public doesn’t like it is because “It’s perfectly safe.  What’s the problem?  Why is there a problem?”  They can’t understand why there’s a problem, and it’s because they don’t believe that the dread and outrage factors count.  I think they count.

Q:  Yes, of course they do.

Nestle:  I think they count.  So I’ll write an updated chapter that will talk about the spinach, the tomatoes, the pet food, the peanut butter and the pistachios, each of which has its own object lesson about what needs to be done about the food supply, but the book itself laid out what needs to be done and that hasn’t changed.

Q:  And that is?

Nestle:  We need a single food safety agency in farm to table, HACCP.  Everybody knows it, that’s what you need to do.

Q:  Why don’t you explain what the HACCP rules are.

Nestle:  Well, it’s that awful name for science-based food safety procedures, hazard analysis, and critical control point, where you identify where the hazards are and where contamination can occur.  You take steps to prevent it.  You monitor to make sure those steps are taken and you test to make sure the whole thing is working.  And where you have HACCP, it’s cut down on food safety problems.  I mean, food is never going to be perfectly safe.  Never.  But we could do a lot better job.
	For example, if there were HACCP rules for pistachios and peanut butter, the FDA has just come out with a report that the pistachio people knew they had salmonella in their pistachios.  They tested.  They found it.  They then cooked the pistachios again.  They roasted them again.  That should have killed any salmonella that were there, but they had no procedures for testing them to see whether it worked or not.  So they just assumed it was okay, and they had no procedures in place for keeping roasted pistachios separate from raw pistachios, so they got mixed together.

Q:  That’s astounding.

Nestle:  I think it’s normal.  I think it’s normal.  It’s exactly what happened with the peanut butter, almost exactly what happened with the peanut butter.

Q:  Normal, how so?

Nestle:  Well, I mean these companies, they are not required to follow science-based food safety procedures.  They are supposedly required to follow good manufacturing practices, but those are basically voluntary.  I mean, really they can do whatever they want.  Nobody is inspecting.  Nobody is holding them accountable.  There is no accountability in the system.  And so you get some unscrupulous or sloppy or cost-conscious manager or somebody who just doesn’t understand how microbiology works, and there’s plenty of examples of that.
I tell a story in Safe Food about visiting a meat packing plant that had a blatant violation of standard food safety procedures.  I mean, it was so shocking that they cooked this product, it was sterile, and then they put in a cold room uncovered.  Not only in a cold room, but a cold room in which there was cold air blasting from a fan in the ceiling.  So if there were any bacteria in there, they were being spit out all over the top of that product.  And I said to the people, “How come you don’t cover your product?”
	And they said, “Well, if we do, it doesn’t cool down fast enough and we miss our second critical control point.”
	I said, “Aren’t you worried about listeria?”
	“No.”
	“Why aren’t you worried about listeria?”
	“Because we’ve never had any problem.”  Three weeks later, they had a recall.

Q:  In terms of meat safety, the [USDA] inspectors are supposed to turn up on a daily basis, I’ve been told.

Nestle:  USDA is there all the time.

Q:  Meaning they have an office in the plant or something?

Nestle:  Yes.  There has to be an inspector in the plant at all times, or the way they do it now for these small plants is that one inspector is in charge of several, but that inspector visits that plant every day.  Now, at the meat packing plant that I went to, they said that you could butcher a dog in front of that guy and he would never notice.  So here is the Department of Agriculture meat inspector in that plant, and doesn’t know enough about microbiology to—

Q:  This is Judith Weinraub.  This is a continuation of my second interview with Marion Nestle.
Let me ask you something.  What do you do every day?

Nestle:  This is what I do.

Q:  No, but I mean you’ve got so much in the air, you have so many obligations, you have so much research, so many books that you’re writing.  What do you read every day, for example?

Nestle:  Whatever comes in on e-mail on a daily basis, and then I have piles of journals and things like that that I read, but I’m very dependent on what people send me now.

Q:  But what about your own blog and the amount of—

Nestle:  Well, I do it every day, but it’s usually based on what people send me or the feeds that I get of one kind of another.  But I work at home in the morning.  So from whatever time I’m up until about noon, I’m at the computer doing whatever.  If I’m in writing mode, I’m writing at least three hours a day, four if I can do it.  And then I’m in the office and I’m talking to reporters.  That’s what I do.

Q:  But how to you prioritize with the many, many responsibilities that you have?  It just seems like even with what you write alone, it’s an enormous amount of work.

Nestle:  If you write three or four hours a day every day, it builds up.  I mean, I don’t feel like I’m—well, today was very difficult because this guy who’s filming something about the Park Slope Food Co-op, I had told him I would go out to the co-op and be filmed there, and I didn’t write it in my calendar.  Oh, and this poor woman with this four-thirty appointment who wants to talk about yogurt, I’ve been putting her off and putting her off, and I’ve really got to get to her.  So that’s what I do.  I see students.  I teach.  I talk to reporters.  It’s not bad.  I travel.
When I stepped down as chair, I was given a very cushy deal here with a lot of unscheduled time that I can fill any way I want to.  I’m on a couple of committees.  I teach one class.  That’s all I do.  It’s not much, and I’m very efficient.

Q:  You are very efficient.

Nestle:  I have to do this before I do anything else.

Q:  Just one thing, though.  Would the young woman who didn’t have any encouragement to speak of when you were starting out in school recognize the person that you have become today?

Nestle:  Oh, probably not.

Q:  Probably not?

Nestle:  Probably not.  I mean, I was never one of these people who could plan or who could look ahead or whatever.  I mean, it just kind of happened.  Food Politics was a life-changing experience, it really was, and it certainly changed the lecture invitation thing.  I mean, I say that as a joke, but people want to hear what I have to say.
We have to stop.

Q:  I understand.
