Interviewee:  Madhur Jaffrey							      Session #2

Interviewer:  Judith Weinraub				         Greenwich Village, NY

Date:  December 16, 2010

Q:  This is Judith Weinraub.  It is December 16, and I’m with Madhur Jaffrey at her apartment in Greenwich Village for our second interview.
Good afternoon.

Q:  Good afternoon.

Q:  Since we’re down here in the Village and I know you knew James Beard, why don’t you tell me about how you met him and what happened after that.

Jaffrey:  Well, what happened was that I had written—let me actually start not with James Beard, but with my first book.

Q:  Okay.

Jaffrey:  Because in a way, you were asking me about it and it’s all one continuous story.

Q:  That’s good, actually.  We’re back to An invitation to Indian Cooking.

Jaffrey:  Yes.

Q:  And working with Judith Jones.

Jaffrey:  I don’t know if I went into it before.  The way the introduction came about was that I had written an article for The New York Times.  I hadn’t written it.  Sorry.  Craig Claiborne did an article on me.

Q:  Yes, we did talk about that.

Jaffrey:  We talked about that.  So as a result of this—I think we talked about it—I was approached by an independent editor.  That came to naught, but then the book went to Harcourt Brace and, at that time, Jovanovich.  It was coming along.  It had been there for a couple of years, and a wonderful young editor there, and then they went through this thing where every half the people or third of the people were fired.  It was one of those times for the publishing industry.

Q:  Just like now.

Jaffrey:  Yes, yes.  So amongst the people fired was my editor, my young editor.  She handed it over to somebody, but it was not a very good relationship.  Nothing was moving because they were in a very precarious position.  So I decided to take the book away.  I had a friend, Ved Mehta, whom you know, who knew André Schiffrin.  This is the actual story.  I’ve never mentioned these names before when I tell the story, because most people don’t know who they are at all.  I didn’t think it mattered.

Q:  I’m glad to have them, yes.

Jaffrey:  So André said, “Let me look at the book.  Send it to me.  I will look at it.  Or better still, I will give it to Judith Jones to look at, at Knopf.”
	So almost overnight, that book, which is now a completed book, you see, because I’d been working on it for so long, went to Judith, and she bought it overnight.

Q:  She must have been very thrilled to have a completed book.

Jaffrey:  It was a completed book, and I had written it pretty much the way it appears.  What Judith was very good at was saying things like, “You need more of this.  You need to say what to serve with what.  You need to have menus at the end of the book, because people are not familiar with Indian food.  They don’t know how to serve it.”  So all that came from her, but basically what I sent her was a completed book.
	It’s funny, I was being interviewed by The Hindu the other day, and they said, “How has your style changed from that time to this time?”  And when I look at that book, I could have written it today.  It hasn’t changed, actually, all that much.  I think I understood the logic of recipe-writing instinctively and didn’t need to be taught how to write a recipe, and I always wrote recipes with a certain amount of detail, because I felt it would have helped me had my mother sent me more detailed recipes, and for people cooking for the first time, it’s absolutely essential.
So my style of writing cookery books had pretty much evolved, and Judith certainly was most helpful in looking at it from the outsider’s point of view and say, “I would want to know this.  I would want to know that.”

Q:  Things you would need for the American market.

Jaffrey:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And those included things like what would you serve with it and all that.  I was already inclined to write stories in there, but she encouraged me to write more personal stories so that each recipe had some connection to human beings rather than just be a pure recipe.
	So now here I am, I’ve got a very tiny advance for this book and it’s ready, and Craig Claiborne has already given it a wonderful review, because he had sort of found me, in a way.

Q:  How did he find you?

Jaffrey:  Through Ismail.  You see, Ismail, whom I keep saying could sell anything he wanted, had, needless to say, found Craig Claiborne, and he always knows who the players are and he gets in touch with them and keeps up with him.  That’s his genius, was his genius.  So he knew, “Okay, Craig Claiborne has to be cultivated,” and made friends with him, told him that he must do an article, the way he talked, “You must do an article on Madhur!  She’s a great actress and she loves to cook!”  So he did this article.  I told you the story about the article.

Q:  You told me about Craig Claiborne, yes.  Not James Beard, but Craig Claiborne.

Jaffrey:  I had told you the story about that.

Q:  Yes.

Jaffrey:  Okay.  So he does this piece.  The book is selling a little bit here, a little bit there.  There are young students at Harvard [University] buying it.  But there’s no great demand for it.  Judith said, “One of the ways we build demand,” she’s very good with all these other aspects of it, “is you should teach.  People should know of you as a teacher.  You should pass on this curiosity, the interest in this new food.”
So I said, “All right.”
She knew James Beard, so she approached him and said, “Where could she teach?”
So Jim, very open, said, “Here in my house.  She can teach in my house.”  He lived on Tenth Street.
So I was going to teach there, but we tried advertising in a meager way, but nobody signed up.  I said to Judith, “What are we going to do?”
She said, “Don’t worry.  We will get a few people from Knopf, maybe a few people from Gourmet, secretaries, assistants.”
Then Jim said, “I will be in every class,” and he was.  He was sitting there in every class.  So that’s how I started teaching and got to know James Beard.
Then he moved to Twelfth Street.  Of course, it was right in my block.  So as he was getting older, he would ask me to come and help.  What he was teaching in those days was basic courses in making pancakes, in making sauces, Hollandaise sauce.  What did I know?  But I had Julia Child.  I had already, without knowing who she was, before she did any television program, had already bought her book, and it was my great introduction to good French cooking.  So I would have to teach classes the next day, and then the night before, I would sit with my Julia Child, and she had great things, like, “If it goes wrong, this is what you do.  If this goes wrong, this is what you do.”  I had really understood all that.  Then I would go teach, and it didn’t seem all that difficult.  So, crepes, pancakes was one course, sauces was another course, and I was teaching all these for Jim.

Q:  As opposed to Indian cooking.

Jaffrey:  I was also teaching Indian cooking, but he would ask me to come and help out on these other courses and other things that he was teaching.  If he was ill one day, then I would teach the course.  So it was a wonderful relationship.  He would come to our home for lunch and we would sit and talk or we would go over to his house and often Marion Cunningham was around.  I had never had polenta before, and she made a polenta with tomato sauce that I thought was the best thing in the world I’d ever had.  [laughs]  So the four of us, Sanford and I and Marion and Jim, would sit and have a meal together, whoever was in town.  So we became great friends.  The fact that I was an actress intrigued him because he was a singer.

Q:  Of course.  He had wanted to perform, yes.

Jaffrey:  He said, “You know, we are very similar.  We are hucksters.”  [laughs]  That’s what he used to say to me.  I thought, “Hmm, maybe I am.”  But he saw a common kind of spirit in me, so that’s how I got to know him.  Of course, over the years we got to know each other better and better.

Q:  Did you stay in touch with him after you stopped teaching there?

Jaffrey:  Oh, absolutely.  I was living here, but he was around the corner, and you couldn’t pass his house, his manservant, Clay [Triplette], would be looking out of the window.  He’d say, “Hi!  Come on in.”
	Then when Jim got ill, we did go to see him when he was ill.  I think this was like a week before he died.  We were going to see him, and I called him up.  I said everybody must be bringing him things, so I should call him and ask him what he’d like.  And I called him up.  We were in the taxi and I jumped out and I called him from a pay phone, and I said, “What can we bring you?”
And he said, “Some strawberries would be nice.”
So we looked for some strawberries.  We took that to his room.  There people were almost having a party there.  And he said, “Open that drawer.”  Opened that drawer.  Nuts.  Opened the next drawer, wine bottles, you know, in the hospital.  So we stayed with him for like an hour, and everybody had a drink and ate something.  Then somebody else must have called, because I heard him say, “Some asparagus would be nice.”  [laughter]  So he loved his food till the end, and we stayed good friends all the time.

Q:  Those are nice memories.

Jaffrey:  Yes, very nice memories.

Q:  Let’s go back to An Invitation to Indian Cooking and the reception of it when it finally was out.

Jaffrey:  The marvelous thing for me and, in retrospect, even more marvelous is that young people in colleges began to buy this book, and it was a word-of-mouth thing.  I have had kids—I mean kids, people in their forties—come up to me and say that they were raised by parents who cooked Indian food from my book, and that they were now cooking it for their kids.  So that has been a great source of comfort, and the fact that that book is still in print.

Q:  It’s a wonderful book.

Jaffrey:  It warms the cockles of my heart [to have the book still in print].

Q:  You mentioned the other day that your mother sent you some early recipes, and one she sent you—

[Interruption]

Q:  What I was asking you about was, you mentioned that one of the recipes involved whole spices, and so you thought that was easier.

Jaffrey:  Yes.  It’s also because I liked it very much.

Q:  Is that in the book?

Jaffrey:  Yes, it is.

Q:  Which one is that?

Jaffrey:  I’ll have to get it.

Q:  Okay.

[Interruption]

Q:  Judith was always present at every photography session.  I remember this cover being done, and Judith was there.  She was there when the photography was being done for my last book.  She’s very present in—

Q:  How many of your books has she edited?

Jaffrey:  Now four, the first two and the last two.
These are my mother’s letters, which were—

Q:  I’ve always wondered what they were.  I see.

Jaffrey:  They’re in Hindi, and there [are] recipes in there.  I was living in London, and obviously it was the time of that war where Israel was involved, England was involved.  It was the Suez Canal.  I remember, because I wanted to write and tell them the British reaction, so I scribbled “Suez” over here, “single room.”  Obviously when I wrote home, I was going to tell them about living in a single room and about the Suez, the reactions to the Suez war in England.  So it gives the time of these letters.
	So the recipe was—this is falling apart.  Lamb with whole spices—here.  [Jaffrey is looking at a copy of the book]. This is it.  It’s the first recipe in the “meats” chapter, this one.

Q:  Are any of the other recipes that she sent you in the beginning in the book?

Jaffrey:  They’re all there.

Q:  They’re all in the book.

Jaffrey:  Yes.

Q:  So there was a potato one.

Jaffrey:  One was [potatoes with asafetida and cumin], yes, which must be in the book, because I started cooking with that one.  See, even here I’ve done all my vegetables alphabetically, always organized in my mind so people should be able to find things in a cookbook.  This was one of the early ones, stuffed whole pea pods with cumin, because I love those.  Potatoes with asafetida and cumin, this one is the first one I ever cooked, and this is what I ate with the pumpernickel bread.  [laughs]

Q:  Meanwhile, the girls were how old at that point?

Jaffrey:  This is 1973, so the girls were ’59, ’60, ’62, so they were like eleven, twelve, thirteen or less.  Sorry.  Eleven, twelve, and down, going down to nine. 

Q:  The reason I ask was I see that you did Autobiography of a Princess in 1974.

Jaffrey:  Right.

Q:  But I didn’t find a book between ’73 and ’81 with The World of Eastern Vegetarian, so basically I wondered were you very tied up either with the kids or with articles.

Jaffrey:  With the kids and I was doing articles and I was touring.  You have that [printout] thing?  I was touring with a touring company, doing like pretty much what I’m doing now, which is talks, lectures.  I was doing a lecture on tea.  I was doing a lecture, readings of poetry from India, from ancient and modern India, but I had worked it out as a sort of seven stages in a woman’s life, pretty much that way, but using poetry from Asia, from all over Asia to do that.  So I was doing that.

Q:  Where was that?

Jaffrey:  Everywhere.  I was getting very good fees.  It was an agency that called me up.  They must have heard me on the radio.  They said, “Would you like to speak, go on a speaking tour?”
	I said, “Speak about what?”
	And they said, “Anything you want.  Obviously you can talk.”  So, based on that, they sent me around.  They called it A Thousand and One Nights, you know, what else, and I probably have a brochure of that somewhere if you want to see it.  I went around on tour and I earned my money through writing articles and doing the speaking tour.

Q:  Let’s talk about Autobiography of a Princess.

Jaffrey:  It took me five years to write the vegetarian book, so it took a while.

Q:  How would you like to do this?  Would you like to stay chronologically or talk about your performing work in one chunk and the food work in one chunk?

Jaffrey:  I think so, because I don’t have the chronology straight in my head.

Q:  Tell me about Autobiography of a Princess.

Jaffrey:  That came about, Jim and Ruth and Ismail were working on it over a long period, because every year they would say, “Oh, we’re going to do it, and we’ve signed Laurence Olivier.”
	And I said, “Oooh, great, great, great!”
	And, “Oh, we’re going to do it this year and we’ve signed Gielgud.”  And it wouldn’t happen.
	So the script had been written much before.  Ruth had written it, and they’d given it to me, but I wouldn’t learn it because I thought, “It’s not going to happen.”  Then when they said it’s James Mason, first of all, I hate to tell you this, but I was disappointed.  I thought, after Olivier and Gielgud, James Mason?  Okay.  They said, “We’re going tomorrow,” and I hadn’t learned the lines.  It was just awful, because it just happened like that.

Q:  Meanwhile, where were they?  You were here.

Jaffrey:  We were all here, but going traveling to different places to do different things.  All of us were traveling around, but basically Ismail was here, Jim was here, and we were all here.  They had gone to India and they’d gotten the footage from the maharajahs, and that’s what started it, from the palaces.  They found these little bits of footage, real documentary footage.

Q:  That’s what inspired—

Jaffrey:  That’s what inspired Ruth to write what she did, and it was based on the footage, really.

Q:  How did they find the footage?

Jaffrey:  They just went around.  Jim, as you know, was very interested in art, major paintings, things like that.  So he loved to travel through India, looking at palaces, and this is what they discovered as part of their interest as well, to see what was available, and there were all these bits of film.

Q:  They were film.  I see.  So that’s what made them think, “We can go farther with this”?

Jaffrey:  Yes, get it all together, old footage of old films that maharajahs had taken.

Q:  So when Ismail said, “We’re going tomorrow,” where did he mean?

Jaffrey:  London.  The screenplay was set in London, so it was to be shot in London.  Suddenly we were there, and I remember the first day of shooting.  I was still struggling because I’d been in a plane, learning, learning, learning my lines, and James Mason came in and he knew his lines.  I’d checked up on him with people who’d worked with him or thought they knew him a little bit, and he seemed to be a monster, an egotistical monster in Hollywood, and yet he was absolutely wonderful with me, absolutely wonderful.  I mean, he would sit—you know when you do your close-up, the other actors usually vanish, but he fed me my lines, he sat on a low stool and fed me my lines.  I would see him walking around the set, saying his lines.  If he had to take off a hat and put it somewhere, take off his scarf and put it somewhere, and he would be practicing like I would, and I thought that was interesting to see.  He was doing this kind of miming with the props, as any actor would, to work out how you would do it.  So it was very interesting shooting with him, and very, very wonderful shooting with him.
	The other interesting thing about Autobiography was that Ismail, in his usual way, had gone up to Garrard’s of London, the big jewelry shop, and said, “We’re shooting this film and we need the best jewels for this princess.”  So he had maneuvered it in some way so I had this necklace, the most expensive diamonds and emeralds, necklace, earrings, bracelet, and every day the equivalent of their Brink’s truck would come with everything, taking a different route every day, and then they would put it on me and tape it to my neck.  One man would follow me to the bathroom, to the this, to the that.  I couldn’t go anywhere.  At the end of the day, they would pull the Scotch tape off and all my little hair would sort of come off with it.
	One day while we were shooting, there was a blackout.  Maybe they plugged in too many things.  I don’t know what happened.  And everybody was on me, protecting the jewels.  [laughs]

Q:  I see.  Not you.

Jaffrey:  Not me.  They didn’t give two hoots about me.  They were protecting the jewelry.  So that’s a typical Ismail thing, you know.  It happens with every film, especially if you’re playing royalty, and I’ve done quite a bit of that for him, like Begum in Heat and Dust.  Again, he managed to lull the people their fears of never letting out their jewelry and collecting it and bringing it.  Ismail had that way.  He did that in Cotton Mary.  He got all the furniture from various people who never gave out their furniture.  He managed to get it from them.

Q:  He was very charming.

Jaffrey:  Yes, yes.

Q:  How long did it take?

Jaffrey:  Actual shooting, four days.

Q:  So you were away from home for how long?

Jaffrey:  Not more than ten days.  But it was shot in sequence.  Because it’s a one-hour film, it was shot in sequence and we did the actual shooting in sequence, but we had rehearsals and meetings and things like that on days before.  But the actual shooting was just four days.

Q:  You were thinking of yourself as an actress primarily at that point?

Jaffrey:  Yes, of course.  Of course.  And the time line, you see, I don’t even have any memory of any food in that time line, though there probably was, because I’m sure the vegetarian cookbook—no, this one had just come out.  Then it came out in England the next year, and then I was working on my vegetarian one and writing all those hundreds of articles that I wrote.

Q:  That were prior to or part of the Eastern Vegetarian book?

Jaffrey:  No, no.  They were completely separate.

Q:  Just making money.

Jaffrey:  Just making money.

Q:  Speaking of making money, the Merchant Ivory company, one thing it’s not known for is making money.  [laughs]

Jaffrey:  I have never made any money on their films.

Q:  So this film was professional and a labor of love.

Jaffrey:  All of them, till the bitter end, until Cotton Mary.  I never made any money on any film, and the only film I made money on was Cotton Mary.

Q:  And why was that?

Jaffrey:  Only because Ismail was horribly, horribly guilty, because I had brought the script to him and I had wanted to direct it, and there was a—well, we won’t go into that one.  But I didn’t, in the end, and I think he just felt very bad about it.

Q:  So you came back here to New York, and did you try to get other acting work or were you primarily—

Jaffrey:  Always, always.  If you look at my acting bio, it might tell you what I was doing in those years.  I can’t remember, actually.

Q:  But that was your primary identification?

Jaffrey:  Yes, to myself, certainly.  Is there anything in that period?

Q:  I’m sure there is.  Let’s see.  The Guru was before that.

Jaffrey:  That was ’67, yes.

Q:  The Guide, Conduct Unbecoming.

Jaffrey:  Those were on Broadway, both of them.

Q:  They were in the late sixties, early seventies?

Jaffrey:  Is there no date there?

Q:  No.

Jaffrey:  I don’t even remember.  I think this was around—yes.

Q:  It says before Autobiography of a Princess and then it skips to Heat and Dust, but you must have done things between ’74 and ’82.

Jaffrey:  Must have, but can’t remember them.

Q:  Nevertheless, your primary identification was—

Jaffrey:  For me, it was as a working actress, but England was the big deal, you see.  England changed that.

Q:  Tell me about that.

Jaffrey:  Because that’s ’82, so I don’t know if we’re jumping ahead or not.

Q:  That’s all right.

Jaffrey:  What happened in ’82 was that I was teaching at home, in my little kitchen, four people at a time, and the BBC was looking to do an educational—so we’re talking maybe 1980, 1979, something like that.  They were looking to do an educational program on Indian cooking, hoping, I think, to present the culture of the community, people would [learn] more about [the South Asian] community.

Q:  Yes, this describes it as an eight-part Indian cooking—maybe it’s a different thing—series plus a cookbook to go with it.

Jaffrey:  Right.  That’s it.  But we started working on it, obviously, even though ’82 may be the date it was shown, it took a good year or more, two years, to put it all together.  So I must have started working on it ’80, probably, ’79, ’80.

Q:  If your daughters were asked what their parents did, how did they describe what you do?  Do you have any idea?

Jaffrey:  I have no idea.  [laughs]  Probably that I’m an actress.

Q:  Sanford’s easy.  [laughs]

Jaffrey:  Yes.  I’m sure they said, “She’s an actress,” because this was all rather vague and undefinable, I think.

Q:  Do you have any sense of when you began to think that this cooking thing could be—

Jaffrey:  After.  After the BBC, because it was a huge hit.

Q:  Yes, it says it was repeated at least five times.

Jaffrey:  The numbers of books I sold and the money I made, you know, because television books sell.  If you have a show on television, you sell books.  This is the unfortunate irony of book sales.  So it was sudden.  I mean, that book has sold over a million copies.

Q:  Oh, my.

Jaffrey:  So it just sold and sold and sold, and is still selling, that book, the first one.  All of them, I mean, they all did well, but this one is still in print.

[Interruption]

Q:  So we’ll go back to Judith and how she reacted to the idea of your doing a—

Jaffrey:  Judith didn’t want me to do a vegetarian cookbook then because she already had an author.  What was her name?  Can’t remember.  She had done two books, first one had been very successful and she had done another, and I thought I was the rightful person who should be doing it because I knew Eastern food and Western food, and I would be the ideal person to do it, but because it had already been done, and successfully done, Judith did not want me to do it, and that upset me.  That really upset me, because I thought I was a great candidate to do this book.  And I did eventually do it, not with Judith.

Q:  Did you have a contract for the Eastern Vegetarian?

Jaffrey:  Yes.  I got more money than I did for this book, Invitation, but really nothing.  This was really minimum payments in terms of royalties.  But that book, too, is still in print, the Asian Vegetarian.

Q:  And you had to travel a great deal for those recipes?

Jaffrey:  Yes, yes, but I enjoyed that.  That’s the part of it I really enjoyed, looking for the recipes, looking for the culture of the areas, seeing what recipes develop in one area and how they differ from another area, and what are the slight differences and why they are there.

Q:  Where did you go besides South India?

Jaffrey:  I was writing articles for Gourmet and traveling for them, and I was picking where I wanted to go.  I would ask them, “Do you want an article on Thailand?  Do you want an article on the Philippines?  Do you want one on Japan or Hong Kong?”  And I was doing all these articles, but it was also for myself, really.  I wanted to see these places.  I wanted to understand their food.  Indonesia was another one.  Goa in India, just different parts of India, different parts of the Far East, and even I did another one—I think it was for Gourmet—on the history of Delhi food, because, again, it gave me an excuse to study what had happened with the food, at least from the Muslim period, starting tenth century at least from there onwards.

Q:  Did you take your girls with you when you would go back and do these things?

Jaffrey:  Sometimes, yes, but I’ve never taken anybody with me on long trips.  I usually go alone to most places, because I work with such concentration.  I’ve kept every notebook.  So what I do is I travel with a little notebook in my bag and I write in pencil, or it could be a pen, in the little notebook.  Then I come back to the hotel or wherever I am staying.  And because I scribble in the car and I can’t read it half the time, so if you don’t fair it out, as it were, that night, as you probably know, it’s gibberish three days from then.  So I used to fair out and fill in the thoughts.  So I have these two books from every place I’ve been, a rough one and a fair one, and I’ve got them.  I just never throw anything away, so the books are there.
	Then I would write recipes in detail.  Like if somebody’s cooking—and I always wanted to see them cook.  I didn’t want them to hand me a recipe, because nobody knows really how to write proper recipes.  They leave things out, and you can’t tell if the heat is high or low, or what kind of pot it is, what is the ideal pot.  So I like to watch them and write all these details down.  They would just do this with salt, you know, just put it in their hand and throw it in.  But eventually I began to have an idea of how much that was, you know, it’s like roughly a tablespoon, roughly a teaspoon.  I would write that “rough teaspoon,” rough this.
	Then I would come home, back to America.  I have never had help.  I did it all myself.  So I would do the shopping, I would do the cooking, the writing down in pencil in the kitchen.  Then I would take it to my computer and write out the recipe in the computer, clean it up, write a headnote of some sort to the recipe.  So it was a lot of work for one person, but I never delegated.  I couldn’t trust somebody to do it as well as I could, because I thought they’re bound to leave something out, they’re not going to be as comprehensive as I am.  Every cookbook has errors of various sorts.  It’s like mistype “teaspoon” for “tablespoon,” that happens, or you leave an ingredient out.  But basically, the cookbooks are as good as my writing can be and as complete as I can make them.  It’s really all my doing.  So if it’s flawed, it’s my flaw, pretty much.

Q:  So in that process, your sense of yourself as a culinary writer must have changed, developed?

Jaffrey:  Not really.  I mean, I think I was doing that from the beginning.  I was just being ultra, ultra careful.

Q:  But what I mean is in terms of this as a professional activity.

Jaffrey:  I never looked at it as such, but in retrospect, I think I became surer, but not necessarily better.  I think I’m just as good in the last book as I am in the first book, so I don’t think I improved markedly, but I have become surer.  That’s all I can really say.

Q:  I was really more asking about your sense of self.

Jaffrey:  More confident.

Q:  Yes.

Jaffrey:  Yes, probably.

Q:  But you were still acting when you could?

Jaffrey:  Yes, I would drop everything.  The only time I couldn’t—and it was a big, big, I think, career changer for me—there was a film called Lean on Me with Morgan Freeman that I was asked to be in.  It was a small part and they said, “We’ll make it a big part if you come and do it, and it will be a month of shooting.”  It was the same time that I had agreed to do the first BBC program, so then it was a dreadful, dreadful choice to do a BBC series in which I was knowingly going to make so much money, and the film, where it seemed I’d done something.  But here was a book, and I knew how well I did in books.  So in the end, I had to turn it down, and my career could have taken a different turn had I done it, because that was one of the first films for Morgan Freeman.  It didn’t happen, though.

Q:  You mean a more American turn?

Jaffrey:  Yes, yes, yes.

Q:  How did Heat and Dust come about?

Jaffrey:  Again, it’s Jim and Ismail.  I think they were ready to give somebody else the part, and I said, no, I wanted it.  Jim said—I remember his words very well—“How can I ask you to play Shashi’s mother when you played his mistress?  It would be very ungallant of me,” Jim said.
	I said, “I don’t care.  I want to do it.”  It was a small part, but I just wanted to do it.  It just seemed like such an interesting film.

Q:  Where was it filmed?

Jaffrey:  In Hyderabad, so it was great.  So then I was exploring the foods of Hyderabad, so terrific.

Q:  What I have is in the next couple of years you started exploring children’s books as well.

Jaffrey:  Right.  I have a need to do something, and empty spaces make me feel I’m useless, so I always fill them up with something.  My husband always says, “You take on too much,” and it’s true, but if I don’t, I’m sitting there, even if there’s nothing to do for two days, I say there’s nothing, I have no work, a desperate feeling.
	So what were you asking me about, actually?

Q:  How the children’s books—

Jaffrey:  So then I had this idea that I never sat down and told my children stories.  I would read them from Indian history, you know, tales of Akbar and Shah Jahan and how they tossed people off the ramparts, you know, and stories like that, more than children’s stories.  I said there’s so many tales that I grew up with, that my aunts and my cousins and older cousins and my grandmother and all told us, and somebody should write them down, because my aunts were all getting older.  There was such a wonderful style of storytelling in the family.  So I started taping my old eighty-year-old aunts and taking their stories down.  I didn’t know when they’d die off, and they did very soon afterwards, but I did tape them all.
I had these stories now, in Hindi, of course, so I rewrote them for American kids, and that’s how the first book started.  Then there was another one of stories that my father used to tell us, so that became the second one.  Then the third one was somebody approached me and said, “Would you do a book about markets around the world with little simple recipes for children?”  Markets around the world and simple recipes.  So that was the third one.

Q:  So these were different publishers.

Jaffrey:  Yes, different publishers.  I tried selling the idea for the children’s book, the first one, Seasons of Splendour: [Tales, Myths, and Legends of India], much earlier, but it was sent around and everybody turned it down, everybody in this country.
So now that I was very successful in England, so a publisher asked me, “We would love you to do children’s books for Pavilion.”
	I said, “I just happen to have something.  I have to find it.  I wrote it a while ago.”  And they bought it immediately.

Q:  It seems like around the same time, what I have written down here is the Assam Garden film.

Jaffrey:  Yes, that was an English one.

Q:  And then doing Medea in London.

Jaffrey:  Same director, yes.

Q:  At BBC.  So it looks like in 1986-87 you were very busy performing.

Jaffrey:  Yes.

Q:  Was that all in London?  How did these come about?

Jaffrey:  Assam Garden was a very interesting story.  There was apparently a very little piece in one of the English papers about a garden that had been discovered in Devonshire, I think.  An English Surgeon General posted in India had come back from India with a lot of plants and he had set up this garden in the nineteenth century.  The garden was now still there.  He’s gone, but the garden was still there, was overgrown, etc., etc.  So the idea, the germ of the story came from that, and the writer wrote a story based on this little germ of an idea.
Then they were looking for a place to film it.  As happens, you send out these people who scout—location hunting based on the script.  So the film-makers were taken to all kinds of locations, and by complete chance, they were taken to this place, the actual place where it had happened.  I think it was on the river.  It may have been in Wales technically or not, I can’t remember, but it was sort of north of Bristol somewhere.  So we shot there.  We shot in that area, near the Severn River.  It was near the Severn River.  It was a beautiful.  The garden had to be cleaned up.  It was vastly overgrown.  We shot in that garden.

Q:  These conversations, when you were having them with these people, you were here, is that right, in New York, and then would return to England?

Jaffrey:  Yes.  I lived here.  Every time I had to get a visa, had to get a labor permit, etc., etc., to work in England.

Q:  Was that complicated?

Jaffrey:  It was complicated, very complicated, but they did it for me every time.  They helped me get it, whatever was needed.

Q:  Is that like the Actors Equity rule here?

Jaffrey:  Yes.  You have to get permission to work there.

Q:  What about Medea?

Jaffrey:  The director of Assam Garden, we got very friendly and began talking, and she said, “What would you like to do?”
	I said, “Well, a classical play, maybe Medea or something.”
	She said, “Let’s do it.”  So she got the ball going and she directed it, so that’s how that happened.

Q:  This says Love Match on the BBC.

Jaffrey:  A television film.

Q:  And Perfect Murder.

Jaffrey:  A film.

Q:  In Britain?

Jaffrey:  No, Perfect Murder was not.  Perfect Murder was sort of an Merchant Ivory film, but not really, because I think Ismail—no, Ismail didn’t direct, but they gave it to Zafar Hai, director.  So they gave the script to him and he directed it, but it was a Merchant Ivory production.  They were in charge.  So that’s how I was in it and so was my daughter.

Q:  Did you feel a continuing part of the Merchant Ivory—

Jaffrey:  Yes.

Q:  Why don’t you talk about that.

Jaffrey:  Merchant Ivory became like a family.  Whenever they had a party, they would collect all the people that had worked with them, so we all got to know each other, you know.  We would see each other at these gatherings, Merchant Ivory gatherings, so if you were Christopher Reeve or you were Emma Thompson or Helen Bonham Carter, we all met all the time, so we feel as if we know each other, but we don’t know each other that well.  Some of us do, but not all of us.  But we did know each other as being part of this family, this Merchant Ivory constellation or whatever it is, and we kept meeting at all kinds of functions.
Of course, a lot of us were there when Ismail died, too.  So we were together in England whenever there was a party in England, all the English side of us would be there, and if there was a party here, there would be some of the English side and some of the Indian side and some from the American side.  The opening, everybody would go everywhere to these things.  So it remained and then actively used again and again, so we would see each other very often at work as well.

Q:  This says that Madhur Jaffrey’s Cookbook was 1988, so at some point you started working on that, and then it says “a three-year project for the BBC, Madhur Jaffrey’s Far Eastern Cookery.”

Jaffrey:  That was a huge project.

Q:  So you were balancing a lot.

Jaffrey:  Right.

Q:  I understand why you kept all your notebooks.  [laughter]

Jaffrey:  I just don’t like throwing anything away, so they just stayed there.  I have to decide what to do with them.  I have to give them to somebody.

Q:  Did you feel any conflict—conflict is perhaps not the right word.  Was it at all hard to balance doing so many things at the same time?

Jaffrey:  No.  You get up in the day and you do whatever you do in the day, and sometimes it was this and sometimes it was that.  It’s like looking after kids, cooking.  Women are used to juggling twenty things.

Q:  When you had to leave New York, Sanford was here?

Jaffrey:  Sanford was here, yes.  Eventually the kids were old enough, eventually, but originally, when they were little, Sanford was here.  For the speaking engagements, it would be like one-night things and back, you know, so I tried managing it, traveling very little when they were little, and then increasing it as they got older and older.

Q:  You continued to work with the BBC, and this one mentions both Far Eastern Cookery—

Jaffrey:  That was a lovely series that they did, very wonderful series in eight countries on the Far East: Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, Hong Kong, Philippines.  Gosh, I can’t even remember them all.  Have I covered everything?  Anyway, there were eight, and it was so much for them that they divided it between two directors and each went back and forth.  It was a year’s worth of shooting, but I had to stay on for most of it because I was the constant.

Q:  Meanwhile, you were collecting recipes from a wider world perspective, from the Far East, that I guess you were eventually able to put to use.

Jaffrey:  And the book that went with the series, it’s always bigger than what you show.

Q:  There’s another series, BBC Radio 4, “six-part series on the history of food from manual to microwave.”

Jaffrey:  That was great.

Q:  What was that?

Jaffrey:  That was wonderful.  That was a radio series.  The English get very serious on radio.  It was food and medicine, food and industry, food and—I can’t even remember all the parts of it.  Food and industry, food and health, medicine, food and war, the Army marches on its stomach, and then just looking around the world and seeing what actually happened.  It was very, very interesting.
	I know about food and medicine in India and China and Far East.  We went to France for various things.  We were looking at the start of the wine industry using the Irish—like the Wild Geese and all these people coming from Ireland to start wineries in France, and we were looking at all that.  I was asking people about the medicinal part of it and what they considered medicine in France.  This doctor told us this wonderful story which we used, because we interviewed a lot of people, and he said for bedwetting, the best cure—and you have to hear this with a French accent; I can’t do it so well—the best cure for bedwetting is to eat a mouse.  So if a child wet his bed, they were forced to eat a mouse.

Q:  Oh, my goodness.

Jaffrey:  And that stopped them bedwetting, the fear.  [laughter]

Q:  Good lord.

Jaffrey:  So we interviewed people like [Simon] Schama, and the guy who wrote the book on sugar.  What’s his name?  John Hopkins.  Sidney Mintz.  We interviewed very interesting people.  I think he was in food and industry.  It’s such a fascinating book on how sugar changed the world, apart from the slaves, all the way to the industry, how it was introduced into England and how the English were made to drink tea with sugar, high tea, and how it all came about.  Tate & Lyle, their money comes from sugar, Tate.

Q:  Sugar was not a natural thing to have with tea?

Jaffrey:  They had no tea.

Q:  I meant in India.  Certainly not in China yet.

Jaffrey:  No.  We didn’t drink tea in the same way in India at all, to begin with.  We learned the British way from the British, and they deliberately introduced it, because it was being drunk like this, China tea, as they called it, in handleless little cups and small amounts, without any milk or sugar or anything in it.  Then the British had to sell sugar to the English, to begin with, and they sold rum, that was one form which they even sold to the people who were growing the sugar, and the other was the barons, sugar barons like Tate, the museum guy, their family, Tate & Lyle, same thing, same family.

Q:  For heaven sakes.

Jaffrey:  Yes.  Same family.  So they are the ones who gave rations of sugar to factory workers, so then they began—

Q:  To get them hooked?

Jaffrey:  To get them hooked on sugar.

Q:  Oh, my goodness.

Jaffrey:  You should read that book, Sidney Mintz’s book on sugar.  So then people started drinking milk and having bread and butter and jam, and that became supper for the English factory worker.  He came home, he had his cup of tea with milk and sugar, lots of sugar, with very simple bread and butter, whatever else he could have, and that became supper or dinner.

Q:  That’s fascinating.

Jaffrey:  Yes.

Q:  By 1991, you were among ten people honored by New York Magazine who have changed the way New York eats.  That’s a very big deal.  Did it seem that way to you?

Jaffrey:  That’s when the honors start, in the nineties.

Q:  Your honors.

Jaffrey:  Yes, because I’m getting older, I suppose.  [laughter]  Somebody went, “Oh, god, we’d better do something about her.”  I have a similar one from Governor Pataki.  Sanford says that all the blacks are picked up and honored in history in February.  Well, there’s a History Month, which is around the same time, Women’s History Month or something like that.  So whatever woman they can find that’s not white, they say, “Okay, let’s look around for the old ones.”  So I got honored by Pataki.  So it just started then, because they’re always looking for, “What have we not got this time?”  So that started.

Q:  Did you continue to teach here?

Jaffrey:  I stopped teaching in the nineties, probably.  It was just too much.  I was working, doing too many things, and as I said, I was doing it all by myself, setting up the classes, typing out all the recipes to be used in the classes, and I wasn’t making all that much money, you know.  It was just not a worthwhile deal.  So I thought, I can teach on television.  It’s much easier.  I can teach with my books, and the return is better, and I have peace and quiet in the home, because the children would come in, sneak in if a class was going on.  Sanford would sneak in.  [laughs]  It was just difficult.

Q:  You must have been very comfortable on television.

Jaffrey:  Yes.  I still am.  I’m comfortable.  I mean, that’s my background, so I’m comfortable on a stage of any sort, except when acting.  Then all the terrors come back.  But if I’m just talking, I can talk.

Q:  Are there still terrors?

Jaffrey:  Every actor has terrors, yes.  Opening-night terrors.  “Will I forget the lines?” terrors on the stage, all that.

Q:  I guess it has to do with being appreciated or liked or applauded?

Jaffrey:  No, it’s just the fright of being alone and you’re carrying something, yet I have no fright when I talk, because my life is not hanging by a thread.  But on the stage, it is.

Q:  Do you have agents for both your writing and for your theatrical work?

Jaffrey:  In England and here, yes.

Q:  When did that start?

Jaffrey:  Fairly early.  I’ve had literary agents and acting agents probably from the sixties, seventies, both there and here.

Q:  I guess the act of having these agents must have made each one of those activities seem quite professional.  I mean, they were quite professional, but—

Jaffrey:  Yes, and made it easier, because I didn’t have to deal with the legal aspect of anything.

Q:  A Taste of the Far East, the Clarkson Potter 1993 book, those recipes, did they come out, in part, of your going around to—

Jaffrey:  No.  Taste of the Far East, I think it was started by Pavilion in England, the other ones who started it, and Clarkson Potter, whoever bought it here, just bought the book, but it was an English book to begin with, a Pavilion book.

Q:  But nevertheless, it looks like that’s the one that won two James Beard Awards.

Jaffrey:  Yes.  It’s a beautiful book.

Q:  One Cookbook of the Year was the other, I guess, Asian or something like that?

Jaffrey:  I can’t remember.  It’s probably there.  If it’s my book, it will be there.

Q:  What was Two Rooms?

Jaffrey:  It was a wonderful play by Lee Blessing.  I was so happy to get the part, because I wasn’t playing an Indian; I was just a State Department official.

Q:  Your father must have been pleased about that.  [laughter]

Jaffrey:  Yes.  I got it some way or the other.  But he was dead by that time.

Q:  I see.

Jaffrey:  That was at the Signature Theatre, which I loved doing.  I was so happy with that.

Q:  So it was at the Signature Theatre in sort of the same way the Signature Theatre functions now?

Jaffrey:  Yes, same people.  Same people.  And I just auditioned for it, just went in for an audition.

Q:  There are an awful lot of books after this, Quick and Easy Indian Cookery, An Indian Spice Kitchen, another children’s book, Market Days.

Jaffrey:  That’s that one I mentioned to you.

Q:  Madhur Jaffrey’s Flavors of India.  How did you come up with new ideas for focuses for cookbooks?

Jaffrey:  I just think about it, and if it interests me in some way, then if it requires research or thought, and if I’m not repeating myself in some way, I will do it.  I need to challenge myself.  I can’t just do the same thing.  People would say to me, “Why don’t you just put some of this and some of that together?”  People do books like that.  I say, “I can’t do that.  You can do it,” and they’ve done it.  That’s why they say I have thirty books.  I don’t.  Because [publishers have often put bits of my books together to create a ‘new’ book.] When you say I have fifteen and sixteen books, they’re all books that I wanted to do, and they tell a particular aspect of food.  They reveal something that has not been revealed before, hopefully. 

Q:  The launch of a line of sauces and chutneys, that was different.

Jaffrey:  Purely monetary decision.  Purely monetary.  I was approached, offered a lot of money in England, and asked if I would do it, and I said yes.

Q:  What was it?

Jaffrey:  It was literally a line of sauces by a company that, until then, just sold—it was a huge, rich company selling rice, Indian rice and teas in England and the world.  Big name.  So they had approached me, and I said yes.  It would be exciting to work with the developers, try and make it as natural to real Indian food as possible.  And even though I knew that there would have to be preservatives in it of some sort if it was going to last a year on the shelf, I thought I would do it because I needed the money.  It was a clear commercial decision on my part.  I’m not a purist in that sense.  I like pure things, but if there’s a way of making money that I can justify in some way, I will do it.

Q:  Had Sanford been working for the symphony a very long time?

Jaffrey:  He did.  He worked for fifteen years.  Then he left.  He left in the eighties.

Q:  Because around that time, musicians didn’t make a great deal of money.

Jaffrey:  No, no.  I mean, I had to work.  This is the thing.  I had kids in colleges, you know.  I had to work.  There was no question that I needed to work and I needed to make money.

Q:  Your honors were a lot to you.  You must have felt quite good about that part of things.

Jaffrey:  I did.  They were rewards.  They were wonderful rewards.

Q:  Was your mother still alive?

Jaffrey:  No.

Q:  What does your family think of what you do?

Jaffrey:  They ignore it.  My family, as it exists, this kind of success means very little to them.  When I talk to my sister in India, she doesn’t create anything, you know but I think she is a step ahead of me in the development of her soul.  [laughs]  My family doesn’t understand [my need to keep pushing].  They say, “Why are you exhausting yourself running around like this?”  I can’t explain, but I am a different person.

Q:  The Silver Spoon Award [in Food Arts magazine], to me, is a big deal because of what that represents.

Jaffrey:  That’s Michael Batterberry and it’s our own people, you know.

Q:  Yes.  I’m trying to think how to describe it for these purposes.  They are people of considerable achievement one way or another, that Food Arts feels they want to designate with a Silver Spoon.

Jaffrey:  Right.

Q:  I’m noticing a reissue of An Invitation to Indian Cooking in ’99.  Do you know if that was the first time it was redone?

Jaffrey:  I can’t remember.  You’d have to check that with Echo Press and Harper.  What’s his name?  First name?  He’s a wonderful guy.  Echo Press is the one that did it.

Q:  It looks like, in the first decade of this century, that you were doing a lot of acting, a lot of writing.  You haven’t slowed down at all.

Jaffrey:  I keep saying I will, I will, I will, but I can’t seem to.

Q:  What was Flawless about?

Jaffrey:  Flawless, I was so excited by the thought of doing anything with [Robert] De Niro, because he was such a hero of mine, after [Marlon] Brando.  It was a film about a man who had a stroke.  The part that concerned me was that he’s had a stroke and he’s angry and he’s resisting any kind of treatment, and I play his therapist, who helps him with his treatment.  But the interesting thing for me was that I thought, oh, I’m going to get to know De Niro because I have these two wonderful scenes with him and we talk and we chat.  Well, he’s had a stroke and he doesn’t talk and he walks with a limp.  So when we were introduced, he was not talking and he was walking with a limp.  He was in character.  [laughs]

Q:  So, no smalltalk on the set.

Jaffrey:  No smalltalk.  Zilch.

Q:  What got you to the Royal Court, Last Dance at Dum-Dum?

Jaffrey:  That was this wonderful, wonderful playwright [Ayub Khan-Din] from Pakistani English, born in England.  Did you see his film called East is East?  It was made into a film as well.

Q:  No.

Jaffrey:  He grew up in a large family.  I don’t remember how many kids there were, but at least eight or nine, if not ten.  I can’t remember.  And all boys except for perhaps one girl.  I can’t remember now.  But anyway, they were brought up in north England by a very strict Pakistani father, and they all rebelled in their own ways.  So East is East is a comedy done first at the Royal Court in London. It was his first play.
Then his next play was Last Dance at Dum-Dum, and he came here to see me and sort of offered me the part after we met.  It was about the Anglo-Indian community in Calcutta, sort of the last of the Anglo-Indian community in Calcutta.

Q:  And what did you play?

Jaffrey:  I played the lead.  I can’t even remember the name of the woman, but one of the Anglican women.  So we did it in London and then we went on tour all over England with it.  So that was wonderful also for me.

Q:  I have next Chutney Popcorn and, the same year, Cotton Mary.

Jaffrey:  Right.  Chutney Popcorn—you must rent and see these films, actually.

Q:  Yes.

Jaffrey:  Chutney Popcorn is the first big film by a young, new Indian American director [Nisha Ganatra], and she’s gay.  The film is about a lesbian relationship, and I’m the mother of two daughters, one straight and one gay.  It’s a comedy and it’s really fun and well done, I think.

Q:  Do you have any feelings about the difference between working on the stage and working in film?

Jaffrey:  No, no.  I just think it’s easier to work on film because once you’ve done it, you’ve done it.  You don’t have to keep doing it as you do on the stage, so it’s harder in ways.  You project differently.  But I think I like them equally.

Q:  Tell me how Cotton Mary came about and what that was.

Jaffrey:  It’s a long, unhappy story, as far as I’m concerned.  A friend of my niece’s wrote it, and this particular niece happens to be in America, lives in America and is married to an American, but he’s a very strange American.  His father and grandfather were missionaries in India.  They are from Cape Cod, but they were American missionaries in India.  He was brought up in India, as my niece was.  He went to that school in Mussoorie [Woodstock].

Q:  I do know what you mean.  I can’t think of it right now.

Jaffrey:  Then they sent him eventually to Oberlin, and my niece went to Oberlin because one of my daughters was at Oberlin, and they met there and they got married.  One of her best friends was the lady who wrote the screenplay.  So she brought it to me, and I took it on, with the idea of directing it, and we worked on it for several years.  Her husband was posted here and then in Bombay.  He was in the Foreign Service at that time, was a lawyer but had gone into the Foreign Service.  He was posted in Bombay, then he was posted in Paris, and we were sending these letters back and forth, and working on the screenplay together.  We did this for a couple of years.
	Then I suggested that we show it to Ismail, and Ismail was going to produce it.  Lo and behold, long story short, one day he was directing it, and I was really upset and mad, and I washed my hands of it.  I said, “You do it.  Cast anyone you want.”
	He said, “You can’t do both.  You can’t act and direct.”
	I said, “I don’t want to act in it.  I want to direct it.  That was my whole dream.”
	Well, again, Ismail, you know how he is.  He went on and on and push and pull, difficult days, and eventually I said okay, and he directed it and I acted in it, but he gave me credit as co-director, though I did nothing, actually, except in the early days when I really helped with the script, absolutely from beginning to end.

Q:  Was directing another skill that you wanted to have?

Jaffrey:  That I was dying to have, and I thought with Jim and Ismail’s help, I could do it.  I couldn’t do it on my own because I hadn’t studied it, but I knew I could visually—I have a very good visual sense—I could do it of technical people were helping me.  But then it just disappeared.

Q:  In your autobiography, you talk about your mother’s influence in terms of your wanting to excel.  How does that play out, do you think?

Jaffrey:  Everything she did, as I said, she wasn’t educated.  She’d gone to the eighth grade, and [after she died], we found all these—I think I told you, all these medals and things that she’d won as a student, but it hadn’t gone beyond that.  So what did she do?  She did the things women do.  She embroidered, but perfectly.  That thing that you see there, that little crownlike thing, she made that.  One was for herself and the other was for her eldest son when he was born.  You know, when your horoscope is made, they tie that [on the heads of the mother and the baby like crowns.]  Anyway, everything.  Her clothes were beautiful.  She just had perfect taste.  She sewed perfectly.  Her food was perfect.  Everything she did, everything she touched was neat, clean, and perfect.

Q:  Do you think you got some of your drive from her?

Jaffrey:  She had no drive.  My father had no drive.  I think I get it from my grandfather or something.  Certainly not from them.

Q:  She had a drive in the sense of excellence in the activities.

Jaffrey:  Yes, but nothing beyond the house.  No dreams of the world or anything.  It was just in the house.  Very quiet, never talked up, as it were, never contradicted my father, you know.  But in her own way, she did everything so well, that I think that sense of perfection I get from her.
I get my love of eating and the garden and all that from my father, who loved gardening, not that he did it himself.  There was a mali to do the work, but he supervised everything.  He wanted his garden to look a certain way, and he got all the trees, he got all the plants, he ordered all the seeds.  So I inherited that aspect of my father.

Q:  I can’t remember if it’s in your book or not, but there’s a reference to him doing a little bit of catering and your tagging along, for weddings.

Jaffrey:  No, he didn’t do the catering.  The caterers came.  The caterers come and they set up tents, and these were special, wonderful caterers.  You’ve probably been to one of these things at weddings.  He would supervise the caterers, to make sure that everything was going well, because he was very interested in what they were doing.

Q:  How young were you at that point when you would tag along?

Jaffrey:  From probably three, four.

Q:  Meanwhile, you continued to do BBC documentaries, to win awards.  It’s all a lot.  [laughter]  It is.  You’re not slowing down at all.

Jaffrey:  No.  I really, really say that, but I get so anxious when I’m not doing anything.

Q:  I understand completely.  The EastEnders I didn’t expect to find.

Jaffrey:  That just came out of the blue.  Again, it was an acting job and I was not getting enough of them.  This is seen by everybody.  They just showed my set of episodes in the last month, and people were talking to me here about it, so obviously it’s shown everywhere.

Q:  Was it fun?

Jaffrey:  It was.  It really was.  I was the matriarch in a particular Indian family in this thing, and I met a whole lot of young kids who were of Indian origin, but they weren’t Indian kids.  They knew nothing about India—they would ask questions like, “Are you Punjabi?”  [And they said that they did not know!] I thought, you know, in India everybody knows what state they come from.  They had no clue, and they weren’t curious about it either.

Q:  What made you decide to write Climbing the Mango Trees?

Jaffrey:  I did not want to write an autobiography of any kind.  My editor in England kept saying, “You should do one.  You should do one.”  And finally I said I would, but I wouldn’t go beyond twenty-one.  So at least that would protect this part of the family, and somehow everything else has a little distance and many people are dead.  But then when I began writing it, I realized that I couldn’t even go beyond eighteen.  It was just too difficult and too many people involved.  It’s been hurtful to a lot of people, so when people say, “We want to know what happened when you came to America,” I do want to write that, I do want to write what happened in America, but if I could leave the family out in some way, I would write it.

Q:  It was hurtful because people didn’t like the way they were described?

Jaffrey:  Sometimes they were wonderful descriptions, like how much I adored them, how beautiful they were, but, like my sister, who was so beautiful, didn’t enjoy being called beautiful.  She said, “No, no, no.”  They’re very private.  They’re very, in their own way, conservative.  They’re not conservatives, but conservative.

Q:  Tell me where you write and how.  Do you write on the computer now?

Jaffrey:  Yes, I write on the computer.

Q:  Do you need silence, lots of time?

Jaffrey:  Yes, I need silence, and I’ll do it at night.  There’s no set time.  Some people are very disciplined.  I’m not, because I do so many things.  So when I have time, I do it.  When I’m working on a cookbook, I’m always behind, or any book.  I’m behind, so I’m always rushing at the end.  I can do eighteen-hour days.  I do them every time towards the end.  I’m also highly motivated at that time to get it all right and finished.

Q:  Tell me about the Law and Order episodes.  Do you enjoy doing those?

Jaffrey:  Yes, it’s fun, fun meeting—it’s an acting job.  It’s not a great acting job, because I haven’t had parts in Law and Order that really stand out in any way.  It’s a job.

Q:  You haven’t killed anyone.

Jaffrey:  No.  [laughs]  I haven’t killed anyone.  One of the things I did, something on Psych, I was going to be a suspect, at least, but they sort of killed that aspect of it, so then I was just an ordinary character.  Sometimes television here and there, but nothing I would say, “You must see this.”  It’s okay.  Just jobs.

Q:  What kind of acting do you want to do now?

Jaffrey:  I would love to do something really worthwhile on the stage and on film.  It doesn’t really matter where it is, whether it’s television or stage.  It just has to be a part that makes sense, that has a beginning, middle, and end, and goes somewhere.

Q:  I suppose that’s not easy to come by at all these days.

Jaffrey:  Not for me, no. 

Q:  Because of—

Jaffrey:  I’m thought of as Indian, you know.  I would rather be thought of as just a woman.

Q:  What are you working on now?

Jaffrey:  I don’t really like to talk about that, because nothing is settled.  I have several things possible right now that I will probably get decided next month, but until they get decided, I’d rather not talk about them, only because it may not happen.

Q:  When you are at loose ends, do you care whether it’s writing or acting?

Jaffrey:  No.  I would die for a good acting job, but there have been just so many almost things.  I mean, I almost did a wonderful series which was going to be incredible, and we shot three episodes—it wasn’t even a pilot.  We shot three episodes and then it got cancelled.  Things like that have happened, so I just now stay off it, don’t discuss it till it’s actually going to happen.  [laughs]

Q:  Is there anything we haven’t talked about that you feel you would like to talk about?

Jaffrey:  No, not really.  You may have questions once you’ve put it all together.

Q:  Why don’t you tell me what you’re making for dinner tonight and why, because it’s so contemporary.

Jaffrey:  It’s so odd what I’m doing.  We had been to one of these food festivals that you go to and people give you things.  So we’d been given these gorgeous Allen Brothers steaks, you know.  So they were sitting in the freezer.  I have this one grand-nephew, as I said, who loves meat and his whole version of America is that he’s going to get a lot of meat.  So I invited two of the kids—a grand nephew and a grand niece.  He loves meat and she loves vegetarian food.  So she said she couldn’t come.  So we planned this whole thing and it was going to be Western.  It was going to be either scalloped potatoes with it or potatoes with rosemary and garlic or something like that, and then maybe some squash, some little Western food and a steak, or steaks, these great, lovely pieces of meat from Allen Brothers.
But now she’s called this morning and said, “Actually, no, I think I can come.”  So I said, “Okay, fine.  We’d love to have you.”  [laughter]  So now I’m going to do the steaks, but I would put a few Indian spices on them, so the meat is sort of slightly leaning a little bit, maybe cumin, maybe ginger or something on it, and I will cook the steaks the regular way, but on the side I would have dal, which I’m making, and some rice and maybe three or four vegetables done in a slightly Indian way so the grand-niece can have her vegetarian food.

Q:  It sounds like it will be very delicious in any case.
	Thank you so much for doing this.

Jaffrey:  Thank you.
