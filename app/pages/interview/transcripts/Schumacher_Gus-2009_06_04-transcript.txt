Interviewee:  Gus Schumacher						   Session #1

Interviewer:  Judith Weinraub					      New York City

Date:  June 4, 2009

Q:  It’s June 4.  This is Judith Weinraub, up here with Gus Schumacher and we’re about to begin our first interview.
Good afternoon.  Why don’t we start by your telling me something about, first of all, when and where you were born and what your family life was like and where you grew up, anywhere you want to.

Schumacher:  My father met my mother skiing in New Hampshire in 1936 or ’35 when he was farming in Flushing, New York.  My mother was the manager of the Harvard Law Review and the secretary for Felix Frankfurter at the Harvard Law School.  When they met, there was an agreement that if they were to get married, my father would move from Flushing in Queens to New England and farm in New England, particularly outside of Boston, and then live in the city and reverse commute.  So he lived in Brookline, parked his pickup in the city, and then drove out to Lincoln and farmed in Lincoln, Massachusetts.
	They got married in 1938 and I was born in 1939.  My mother started having a number of children.  She married very late.  She was thirty-nine when she got married, so she had four kids, the last born in 1946.
Then they decided that reverse commuting with four kids and an apartment near Boston didn’t quite make sense, so they rented a home in Lincoln in 1938, ’39 and ’40 and then bought a farm in Lexington, Mass., in 1940, the old Ballard farm, which was a terrific farm.  It was an interesting purchase because my Dad came from a basically three-generation horticultural family, which we can get into in a little while, here in Manhattan and then Queens.  He had seven brothers and two sisters, all farmed in Queens.  When the people bought farms back in the thirties, the farm was bought with all the crops and all of the livestock in situ.  So in April 1940 when he bought the Lexington farm where I grew up, basically, Mr. Ballard and his wife moved to retirement in New Hampshire, but all the crops were planted, all the animals were there, all the pigs, the poultry, the horses.  There were no cows, and there were seventeen Polish men living in the back of the house.

Q:  Oh, my.  You mean farm workers?

Schumacher:  Yes.  They had come from Poland in the thirties during the Depression and they lived in the back of the home.  My mother had two stoves, wooden stoves, coal stoves, and a special woman to help cook.

Q:  I should hope so.  [laughs]

Schumacher:  So my mother cooked for about twenty people three times a day with the help of a cook that came with the farm.
	Then the war started and, of course, most of the men were drafted and went on to the war, so there were only two men left that I really remember, maybe a little older, too old to go to the war, and they lived with us in the farm.  There was a dormitory in the back of the house, in one of these New England farmhouses.  We lived in the front and the men lived in the back.  That was fascinating.

Q:  What was the community like?

Schumacher:  It was a suburban community.  It was basically eight miles from Boston, ten miles, Lexington, Mass., where the shot was heard round the world, where the Minutemen came.  In fact, where the British soldiers went from Charlestown to Lexington and from Lexington to Concord, they went right through my father’s farm, where the stone wall—so as kids, we’d get our BB guns out and behind the stone walls and play “Let’s shoot Redcoats.”

Q:  A little reenactment there.

Schumacher:  A little reenactment from the kids.  We’d pretend we’d shoot Redcoats.

Q:  Had your mother ever lived on a farm before?

Schumacher:  No.  No, she graduated from Boston University.  My other grandfather, her father and mother, were Irish immigrants, first generation, and she wanted to become a lawyer, but women were not allowed into the law schools back in the twenties.  It was not a permitted entry to law.  So she loved law and she got a job as the personal assistant to Felix Frankfurter, and she worked there for fifteen years.  My baby cup, actually, is from Felix Frankfurter, and I visited him when he was still alive in Washington in the early sixties.  My mother would take us down there to visit.
	So this was kind of a new thing for her from being a prominent administrative assistant manager of his affairs and manager of the Harvard Law Review, where she got to know all of the major people who worked on the New Deal.  She never admitted it, but I think she dated Alger Hiss.  She knew Phil Graham when he went to law school.  She knew Tommy Corcoran.  So there were great discussions at the dinner table in the fifties between my father, who’s Republican, my mother, who’s Democrat, was Hiss a communist or not, and Whittaker Chambers versus Alger Hiss.  I remember when I was nine, ten, twelve years old, there was vibrant discussion, and my father saying, “He’s a commie,” and my mother saying, “No, I knew him.  He’s not a commie.  He couldn’t be a commie.  He’s a very nice man.”  “You may have known him, but he was a commie.”  So there was a lot of discussion on the New Deal over the kitchen table.

Q:  So where did they meet, actually?

Schumacher:  They met skiing in a ski resort up in New Hampshire, because back in the twenties and thirties, farming in New York City, you were profitable.  My grandfather, my great-grandfather and my uncles were, frankly, prosperous, and they did very, very well.  When you grew vegetables year-round in Manhattan and Flushing in the late nineteenth century and up until about 1955, you were prosperous.  You made more than a good living growing leeks and parsnips.  We can come back to that in a minute.

Q:  Do you have any visual knowledge of or photographs of the Manhattan farm?

Schumacher:  Yes.  The original Manhattan farm, my mother’s side was Irish immigrant, and my father’s side, my great-grandfather came from Germany.  His name was John Schumacher.  He was on the wrong side of the 1848 social revolution in Germany, so he thought he’d get out of there before he got nixed.  So he came to New York in 1848, ’49, and heard about something called the Gold Rush.  So somehow he got to California, did some mining and found a little bit of gold, not much but a little, managed to get it back to Manhattan, where he rented a farm at 72nd and Broadway in Manhattan in 1855, and then farmed there, I guess from what we can figure, from 1860 to 1886, when 72nd Street was cut through.
	Remember, back in the nineteenth century, New York was really Wall Street, the Seaport area.  That’s why Central Park, they didn’t take any houses down; that was all farms.  So when the Dakota was built in the 1880s, 1890s, of course, they called it the Dakota because it was like in North Dakota; not many lived there.  I mean, no one was living uptown.  It was very unusual for an apartment building to be built at 72nd or 73rd Street in the West Side, because nobody lived there except farmers.  So then they cut 72nd Street through in 1888.

Q:  Cut it through to the river?

Schumacher:  To the river from Broadway or whatever, and right through my grandfather’s house.

Q:  So do you have pictures of that house?

Schumacher:  Oh yes.

Q:  What did it look like?

Schumacher:  Not a fancy house, basically wooden boards and a roof, very, very simple.  It wasn’t a shack.  It wasn’t a cottage.  It was sort of kind of like when you build something in Montana in 1890.  I have pictures of my grandfather, my great-grandfather and grandmother, sitting in front of the farm, plus some of the pictures of the farm.  In fact, it was written up in the New York Times when they talked about my grandfather in 1934.  They talked about farming on 72nd and Broadway, and the interviewed my grandfather on what it was like. He said it was great fun because he could sit on the side of Broadway and watch all the great events, including the funeral for Grant.  He sat and watched Grant’s funeral as a boy when he then was entombed at Grant’s tomb.

Q:  As it went up Broadway.

Schumacher:  As it went up Broadway, he sat out front on this curb and watched the cortège go by for Grant going to Grant’s tomb.  He put in his diaries, “Watched Brooklyn Bridge being built.”  We’ll come back to why the Brooklyn Bridge was very important for farming in a minute.

Q:  Primarily they were farming root vegetables?

Schumacher:  Basically Northern European crops, so, root vegetables, parsnips, carrots, turnips, cabbage, leeks, and what we’ll come back to is soup greens.  They did not farm what we call Italian crops.  Those are neighbors who grew peppers and tomatoes and the warm season crops.  But they were traditional cool season crops, year-round, but more of a northern German, Polish-type crops than Italian or southern French crops.

Q:  And the leeks you mentioned?

Schumacher:  Lots of leeks, lots of parsnips, onions, cabbage, potatoes, tiny bit of sweet corn.  As we said earlier, he kept a diary from about 1890 to the day he died in 1955, daily, on farming in New York, where he recorded the weather, the crops he planted, the crops he harvested, who he sold them to, which farmers’ market he went to, and then who visited or who he visited and who dropped by, and then any illnesses and deaths in the family were recorded.  We have all the diaries, so a complete record of Manhattan and Queens farming for nearly sixty years.

Q:  When did he move to Queens?

Schumacher:  1888, 1890.  When the 72nd Street was cut through, they originally moved from 72nd and Broadway to Flushing, near LaGuardia Airport on Hempstead Pike, and bought a sixty-acre farm in Queens and farmed there from about 1890 to about 1935.
Then the subways went through, and Flushing became quite urban or peri-urban, and they were pressured by all the housing developments, so he sold the farm for house lots and moved to New Hyde Park, which was about eight miles further east, and bought the old Vanderbilt place.  Vanderbilt had an estate which had a farm that went with it, and so he bought that farm, and his sons bought farms nearby in New Hyde Park.  So there were three or four farms of about eight or ten acres in that region where New Yorkers, many of my Jewish friends, were born in Long Island Jewish Hospital, and he donated the land for that hospital to be built on his farm in about 1955.  So you drive through the road, Schumacher Road, to get to Long Island Jewish Hospital.  So some of my younger friends, when I was working in Washington, were actually born there, and their mothers drove over my grandfather’s farm to get to the hospital to be born.  Kind of fun.

Q:  So your parents married in—

Schumacher:  ’38.

Q:  —’38, and you were born in ’39, but you were born up there.

Schumacher:  Yes.

Q:  So had they been living in Massachusetts for—well, they must—no, they moved.

Schumacher:  They moved.

Q:  They moved immediately to—

Schumacher:  When they got married, my mother said, “You want to marry me, you come to Boston.  You farm anywhere you want outside of Boston, but I’m not moving to New York.  Your choice.  We get married, move to Boston, we live in the Brookline, you reverse commute,” and then eventually when all the kids came, they had to move out to Lincoln and Lexington, where basically I was raised.

Q:  You have siblings.

Schumacher:  Yes, a brother and two sisters.

Q:  Where did you fit in?

Schumacher:  I was the oldest.

Q:  How relevant was farm life to your life?

Schumacher:  Oh, it was pretty crucial.  We grew up, as I said earlier, with Polish men living in the back of the house, and then when they went to the war, we had two Polish men left, and then he would pick up Italian women workers in Waltham, who were also immigrants.  So then we had eventually Puerto Ricans coming up from Puerto Rico, so it was kind of a very integrated community, sort of a micro community of our family, all the neighbors and friends.  There were farms up and down our street, maybe six farms.  So we were farming a micro area of Lexington, plus the workers.  My dad was the biggest operator in the area, so he must have had twenty, twenty-five workers every day, and during the war, we had German prisoners who were from Rommel’s North African army, were captured in ’43, brought to Fort Devens, so at that point we had forty or fifty.

Q:  Where is Fort Devens?

Schumacher:  About twenty miles west of Lexington in Ayer, Mass., and they were imprisoned there.  But the regular army workers had to work.  The officers didn’t have to work.  During the war, we had to ramp up production so we had a lot of workers on the farm.

Q:  You had some of the prisoners working on the farm?

Schumacher:  Thirty prisoners every day, plus about eight Italians and about four Polish and then eventually Puerto Ricans, so it was sort of a U.N. of—

Q:  Not a bad way to spend the war, actually.

Schumacher:  I remember when I was about five or six years old, my mother was not the greatest cook.  The Irish cared more about what they said, not what they ate, and so cooking was not her specialty.  But then the Italians would bring in these new and interesting foods for lunch, so my brother and I would always skip out lunch and go out and have lunch with the Italian women and have things like hoagies, and special really salami and provolone and just delicious sandwiches, whereas back home I got egg and beans.  So the heck with that.  We’d go to go to the barn and have a decent lunch with the Italian women workers.

Q:  That’s funny.  How did your schooling fit into all of this?

Schumacher:  Just public school right to Lexington High School, but they were excellent schools.   But I remember in 1950 there were Italian men started coming in to work, a few.  I don’t remember them that well, but about two months ago [Sept. 2009] someone looked me up on the internet from California and said, “I think my father worked for your father,” and I said, “How do you know?”  “Because he signed your father’s name, signed his Social Security application,” which we have a copy of, and he scanned the Social Security application and sent the application to us, and I identified it was my father’s original signature.  Then he sent the picture of his father, and I found a picture of his father working on the farm.  So he had a picture of his father and his grandfather, his father and mother, and the man, who was now my age, sixty, and his son and grandson.  So I was able to identify his father from pictures we had taken on our farm, and I sent them, too.  Kind of a déjà vu from the fifties.  Again, this richness of the ethnic immigrants, but they weren’t housed in camps like they are in California.  They lived right with the families, and we cooked and ate together over that period of time.  Fascinating.

Q:  So would you go to school at like normal school hours?

Schumacher:  Yes, take the bus in.

Q:  And did you do farm work before and after school?

Schumacher:  No, I had to go take care of the animals before school, and we had sheep and poultry and a horse.  So my job, my brother and I had to look after the chickens and feed the sheep and brush the horse.  Then we had an egg route, so we had to take our eggs to the neighbors and sell eggs, make money after school.  Then I had a trap line.  I was a trapper, and I would go out and get muskrat and mink after school in the wintertime and then skin them and sell them to Sears, Roebuck.

Q:  My lord.  Wow.  How did you have time for homework?

Schumacher:  Just do it after six o’clock.  It gets dark in New England in the wintertime, five, five-thirty.  The bus would drop you off at two-thirty, three o’clock, so you had time to do your egg route and then check the trap lines.

Q:  So you didn’t have to shoot the mink?

Schumacher:  Oh yes.

Q:  Oh, you did?

Schumacher:  Yes.

Q:  The trap lines weren’t enough to kill them?

Schumacher:  Well, no.  You’d bring your .22.  You know, people don’t have guns these days, but we had guns.  At eight, nine, ten years old, we had .22s.  During the wintertime we’d go trapping, and then in the summertime, the woodchucks would eat the lettuce, so my father would give me a buck for every woodchuck I shot.  So I got a telescopic sight and I’d sit up on the hill, and I’d watch the woodchucks pop up and knock them off and then bury them in the hole, and then bring the tails back and get my dad to give me a buck.

Q:  You mean the tails were all they were interested in?

Schumacher:  No.  You know, you wouldn’t haul a dead woodchuck back to the house, because the dogs would then tear it up.  You’d just cut the tail off, so you have evidence you actually shot it, and then throw the woodchuck back in the hole and bury it up.

Q:  But, meanwhile, you were ridding the land of critters.

Schumacher:  Varmints that were eating our lettuces and crops.  They could do a real job on the cabbage and lettuce.  You want to knock them off.

Q:  What kinds of things were you studying in school at that point?

Schumacher:  Just regular high school, you know, just get through high school, the normal high school English, geometry and algebra, Latin, the usual stuff.

Q:  How did you envision your future?

Schumacher:  Well, my brother and I, being on the farm, back then in the fifties everybody was a jock, and so my brother was a great football player and I was a runner, so we all applied to college and got in.  I guess I was the only farmer’s son to be let into Harvard back in 1957.  I guess I was called diversity then.

Q:  But you’ve told me it had something to do with your having saved money from the gourds you sold.  Could you tell me a story about that?

Schumacher:  Well, actually, it’s interesting being a public school kid, you have your whiffle, your white bucks, your sport coat, you’re going for interviewing, and I remember the man very well, Peter Briggs, who become a friend subsequently, who was the interviewer.  Mostly the kids going to Harvard then were prep school kids, well-off families from prep schools.  So not many farmers’ sons were.  In fact, I was the only one that was considered and got in.

Q:  In your year?

Schumacher:  As far as I can tell, I was the only farmer’s son that was in my class of seven hundred, and he told me later on—I remember the interview very well.  He had a tradition of asking the interviewers what you did last weekend, so he asked what did I do last weekend.  And I said, “Well, I picked gourds.”  He said what the heck were gourds?  I explained that gourds were ornamental gourds that you picked, shellacked, and sold to flower shops for putting on fall Thanksgiving tables, and that my father gave me a half an acre of land and he said, “Grow gourds.”  I wanted to grow gourds.  My brother and I grew these gourds, and we picked them, harvested them, shellacked them, and sold them, and then we exhibited them at the local horticultural hall.
	So Briggs asked me this.  He said, “All right, Schumacher, gourds, okay.  You’ve explained what these things are.  All right.  Do you make any money?”
	I said, “Yeah.  What’s the tuition here?”
	He said, “Well—,” he told me.”
	I said, “I can pay my own way.”
	He said, “Really?”
	I said, “Yeah, made some money, put it in a savings account.”  Almost pay my own way if I lived at home.
	Then he leaned back, and I remember so well, he said, “No, Schumacher, this is Harvard.  You grow gourds well?”
	I said, “Well, two weeks ago I won the first prize of the Horticultural Hall for the adult gourd category.”
	He said, “You’re kidding me.”
	I said, “No.”
	He said, “Do you have evidence?”
	I brought in the little sticker, which I still have, from the Hort Society of 1956, ’57, whatever, first prize, American Gourd Society, Horticultural Hall of Boston, which is kind of funny.
	Dave Souter was a classmate of mine.  He had lunch at the Supreme Court a few years ago, and Pete Briggs regaled us with—he remembered those stories and said the same thing about Souter.  Apparently, he asked the same question of Souter, “What did you do last weekend?”
	“Well, I preached at the local congregational church.”
	He said, “You did what?  You’re sixteen years old.”
	“Well, the minister died six months ago.  We’re having trouble getting a new one, I’m a fill-in.”  Kind of interesting way of interviewing students, “What did you do last weekend?” kind of thing.  Anyway, that was kind of funny.

Q:  What were your expectations when you went to Harvard?  Did you see your life in any particular direction?

Schumacher:  No.  I was an economics major.  I mainly was interested in sports.  I did cross country, indoor and outdoor track, four years in a row, and that was my main objective, being a runner.  We actually qualified for the Olympic trials in 1960, so some of us went out to that, and I went and didn’t do that well, but we ran a pretty good time.  But it was fun to try out.  We qualified for the pre-trials.  That was fun.
	Then I had no idea what I wanted to do.  I thought I’d go to the Cornell Hotel School and be a hotelier in the Hilton Hotel in Caracas, Venezuela, for a while.  I don’t know why.  So I decided I’d better get some more education, so I looked at the options of going one year to Stanford, and for the same price I could go two years to the London School of Economics.  So I wrote to London and said, “Could I come for two years?” and they said, “Sure.  Fifty pounds a term.”  So I figured I’d have money left over I finished graduate school, so I had no debt when I finished two years of graduate school.

Q:  And the money was from?

Schumacher:  I just had money left over.  Of course, back then you could actually earn your way through college.  I had a little bit of money in savings, so I had money left over from my savings and working during summers.  Could never do that now, but tuition then $750 a year.  Now it’s $30,000 a year.  I could earn half my tuition, or more than half my tuition, during the summer.  You worked jobs during the winter, and you basically, with a little bit of savings and a little scholarship, you had no debt.  So I had no debt when I finished graduate school.

Q:  Were your parents unhappy about the prospect of your not returning to the farm?

Schumacher:  No.  My brother became a landscape contractor and lived on the farm, so he used all my dad’s equipment.  Then my brother eventually bought his own farm and did very well at that.  So my two sisters, one’s a schoolteacher.  Both involve teaching.  So they were, “Whatever you want to do.”

Q:  Tell me what the years at LSE were like and what kinds of things you were doing there.

Schumacher:  Basically studying economics and running.  You could be semi-professional athlete in Europe, whereas if you were in America, you did your four years, and then they were finished.  But in Europe there was a club system, so I could play basketball and run track for the University of London and LSE, and so I spent two years running around Europe.  It’s great fun.

Q:  Two years meaning during or after?

Schumacher:  During the time I was at University of London, LSE, just basically ran every track meet I could find, every basketball game I could run up, and then the big one was the University of London against the Hungarian ex-Olympic team in 1962 for the national championship of England, and they’d beat us by 20 points.  They were very good.  It was fun.

Q:  Did you have any experience with British farms while you were there?

Schumacher:  No.  I lived in downtown central London.  The only time I visited farms was running through them because we had winter cross country in the middle of winter.  So you’d run through these mud fields on these farms.  I never actually visited.  I don’t recall visiting any farms, except once when I visited my mother’s relatives in Ireland who were still farming, for Christmas, and we visited their farms in Christmas of 1961.

Q:  So how did you see your future?

Schumacher:  Just sort of accidental, I mean, in the sense that when I went to the London School of Economics, my tutor was Lord Robbins, who was one of the founders of the World Bank.  So he asked me, “What do you want to do with your life?” and I said, well, I hadn’t really thought about it.
	When Jack Kennedy was elected, I thought I’d like to go back and work for the Kennedy administration, so I studied trade and agricultural economics at LSE and also at Harvard and said, well, why don’t I look at trade negotiations on agriculture, and got myself a job as a trade analyst at the Tariff Commission.  But then Lord Robbins said, “Why don’t you go work at the World Bank?”
	And I said, “I didn’t know anybody there.”  So we figured out to get an internship.  So I got myself a summer internship for fifteen bucks a day, and at the end of the summer, the two people that my boss—there were three of us working for this both, named Albert Waterston, and two of the people left, and Albert said, “Would you want to stay on and help me?”  Because his two staffers, Cyril Martin and Fritz Steuber, were leaving.
	I said, “Well, I’m twenty-three.  That’s a bit young, and they don’t normally take people at twenty-three.”
	He said, “Well, why not?”  So I guess I was at some point—he said, “Why don’t you become a junior professional and quit the US Tariff Commission and work for me?”
	I said, “How am I going to do that?”
	He said, “Well, call up the personnel department.”  And the personnel department said no.  I don’t have any fancy degrees.  I’m twenty-three.  And Albert Waterston said, “But I want this kid.”
	So I was apparently the youngest person ever to be hired by the World Bank in 1963, fifteen bucks a day.  That’s all right.  You could live on that then in 1963.

Q:  What did you do?

Schumacher:  Initially working on development economics, and then in 1966 that became the big change.  I told Albert I’d like to work on agriculture, and he counseled me against it.  He said, “No, agriculture’s a dead end, and no one’s working on agriculture.  It’s boring.  You’ve got to work on fancy stuff like econometrics.”
	I said, “No, I’m going to work in agriculture.”
So I got myself a job working as a project officer on agriculture in the evolving Agriculture Department at the Bank.
	Then in 1968, McNamara joined the bank, and that changed everything.  McNamara said, “We cannot continue the way the Bank has been run.  We need to work with small farmers worldwide, and I want 40 percent of the lending to be for agriculture in 1968.”  He gave a famous speech in Nairobi, and that became huge.
	I happened to be very well positioned, having been there four or five years, and so I started leading missions on agriculture in 1968, ’69 and ’70 because they were just trying to build up their staff.  So I guess I was the youngest mission chief ever for the bank, at the age of twenty-seven, leading missions to Uruguay on livestock.  It was fun.  That was really fun, because I went all over the world doing agricultural projects for the Bank in ’68 to ’78.  It was fun.

Q:  Do you know why McNamara was interested in that in particular?

Schumacher:  Call him up.  I have his number.  You can just call him up and ask him.  He’s still alive.  He just looked at the numbers.  He was a very smart man, and he looked at the numbers and said that 90 percent at that time of people in the developing countries worked in farming, and building steel mills wasn’t going to exactly help Africa, Brazil, and India to recover, to grow.  So he said, “I want 40 percent and I want that to be working on the poorest farmer.”  So that was a great chance, and we really built up the agriculture group at the Bank very rapidly, and we achieved those targets.

Q:  What countries were you going to?

Schumacher:  Greece, which was a very poor country in the mid-sixties, and then eastern Africa.  Greece, Guyana, Mauritius, Kenya, Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania and then heavily involved in Latin America, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, and then later on in China and then the nineties in Eastern Europe.  It was fun.

Q:  How did your own farming background inform this work?

Schumacher:  Well, one thing, I could drive a tractor.  That you grew up, if you have three generations of farmers, you kind of have a flavor of the seasonality, the cropping, the irrigation, the mechanical side, the marketing, the packaging.  From the age of infant until I was twenty-one, you’re on the farm.  You were working the farm.  You were driving the tractors.  You were feeding the animals, all that kind of stuff.  So, imbedded in your sort of being is what the rhythms of the seasons, rhythms of the agriculture, rhythms of the difficulties, too.  You know, my father, there were some tough times and things weren’t going that well.  You understand the cycles of agriculture, the cycles of weather, the cycles of bad policy.

Q:  Bad farm policy?

Schumacher:  Yes.  For example, most of the commercial agriculture in the East was wiped out when the big subsidies for irrigation in California went in.

Q:  Explain that.

Schumacher:  Well, they put in basically free water for California in 1950s, so you then had subsidized water, huge numbers of [unclear] immigrants [unclear], and then Eisenhower built the interstate highway system, so you could land a trailer load of carrots into Boston for half the price that farmers in New England could grow carrots and lettuce, so that basically most of those farmers went out of business. Dad stopped farming in the mid-sixties.  You couldn’t make a living if you sold wholesale.  If you sold retail, the number of farmers then in New England switched to roadside stands in the fifties and sixties, and they’ve prospered, but selling to commercially wholesale, very difficult.  Most of those farmers went out of business.  All your major vegetables, some exceptions, went out of business.  Your apples stayed a little bit in.  So, in Massachusetts in 1950, maybe you had 12,000 farms.  By 1974, they dropped to 4500 in Massachusetts.  So you lost more than half your farms in a period of ten, twelve years.
	Then it turned around.  In 1975, Dukakis was elected and brought a Commissioner in, Freddie Winthrop, and he started a whole range of programs, Farmland Protection, direct marketing, “Mass Grown and Fresher.” 

Q:  Direct marketing meaning roadside?

Schumacher:  Yes, farmers’ markets, roadside stands.  It was called Massachusetts Fresh and Grown and Fred Winthrop went on TV, said, “Let’s buy local.”  Dukakis and Freddie Winthrop started that nationally.  They started the Farmland Protection Program.  They started the local roadside stands.  They started embryonic farmers’ markets.
	My brother was landscaping and he said, “This is pretty interesting,” so he went and bought another farm, bought a 200-acre farm, and then did all direct marketing.  He wouldn’t sell any wholesale from 1976 till-mid eighties, all retail, and that’s when I got really interested, when I was at the Bank.  I used to fly up and help him on the weekends.

Q:  I was wondering about that.  I was trying to fit in the times that I knew you worked on the farm.

Schumacher:  Because then they had something called New York Air, and you could get $49 each way from National Airport to Logan, and you got a cheap $30 rented car.  So for 150 bucks, I could fly up on weekends.  John would load the truck with the stuff in the back on Friday night, and I’d then take the truck in at five o’clock in the morning to the farmers’ markets in downtown Boston on the weekends.
	So he would have pick-your-own and the roadside stand, and then I’d do the direct marketing on weekends during the summer and fall.  I was making as much money selling in the farmers’ market in Dorchester as he was selling in the roadside stand that day.  So we’d sit around his living room with all the cash, and that was kind of fun.  But at that point, 1980, is when things really became really interesting, because I was selling in Dorchester, and it’s a poor neighborhood.

Q:  In the farmers’ market there?

Schumacher:  Fields Corner Farmers Market in Dorchester was first of the new ones.  My brother had a terrific orchard of Bosc pears.  He had the largest Bosc pear orchard in New England, ten acres.  These are very high value.  I mean, Bosc pears are not like Barletts.  These are the Cadillac of pears.  I brought in ten bushels and we sold most of them, but one of the boxes was bad, and as I took the box back to the truck, it didn’t sell, it fell apart, wooden box, you know, and all the pears went into the gutter.  I remember it so well.  I thought, oh, darn, that’s $40 worth of pears.  I have to pick a shovel and throw them in the garbage.
	So I went to get a box around the front of the truck, and when I came back, there was an Irish-American woman who looked to be late thirties with two young boys—it looked to me they were six, eight, nine, ten years of age—picking the pears out of the gutter.  I said, “Wait a minute.  What’s this about?”  She thought I was going to arrest her.  “No, no, no.  These are damaged pears.  Why are you taking them out of the gutter?”
	She said, “You’re not going to arrest me?”
	I said, “No, no.”  We used to have them in pecks.  You know what a peck is.  So I gave her a peck of apples, maybe pears, maybe six pounds or so, and I said, “Here, take these.  They’re better pears and some apples.  But why are you in the gutter on your knees picking pears out of the gutter?  That’s awful.”
	She said, “Well, my husband left me six months ago.  I’m on food stamps, and they don’t provide enough for fruit and vegetables.  You just buy calories.”  She was a little overweight and didn’t look good.  She didn’t have good color.  She wasn’t unhealthy, but she wasn’t eating right, certainly.  The boys looked okay.  So I gave her the pears.  But I remembered that.

Q:  How old were you when that happened?

Schumacher:  Forty.  Then in 1984, my father called me up and said, “Guess what?  Freddie resigned the Commissionership.”  Fred Winthrop was the man who had really started this local food movement and local agriculture, under Dukakis.  Dukakis was very pro-agriculture and gave Freddie a fair bit of money to buy farmland, protect farmland, do direct marketing, start some new farmers’ markets, foster the basically “Buy Local, Buy Fresh,” called “Mass Grown in Fresh Air”, and he was on TV a lot.  There were these ads.  You could then do public service ads, and back then they put these public service ads on the news.  So Freddie was on the news a lot promoting Massachusetts agriculture.

Q:  He was the Commissioner of Agriculture at that point?

Schumacher:  He was Commissioner of Agriculture, a great leader.  So he resigned, and my dad said, “You know, he’s resigned.  Your mother has passed away and you’re single, so come on up.”
	I said, “Well, how do I get the job?”
	He said, “Well, call them up.”

Q:  Where were you?

Schumacher:  World Bank.

Q:  Still?

Schumacher:  Yes.  World Bank.  So I applied for the job, and to my amazement, was interviewed and got the job in 1985.  So I took a leave of absence from the Bank.  I thought I’d leave for two years and left for seven and had a great time as Commissioner of Agriculture.
	Freddie really laid a good base.  Dukakis was the Governor and then ran for president and the times were prosperous, so we had a fair bit of money in the state, so we had a good budget.  So I was able to take Freddie’s program of Farmland Protection and double it.  We started the whole direct marketing, expansion of farmers’ markets, really expanded money on fresh foods.  Visited USDA [the United States Department of Agriculture] in Washington.  We figured out how to get some money out of the federal government and then leveraged that money to hand out for improved marketing.

Q:  How did you do that?

Schumacher:  Just asked for it.

Q:  I see.  [laughs]

Schumacher:  I mean, being my mother’s Irish and me being half Irish.

Q:  You asked the USDA?

Schumacher:  Yes.  Just go down and worked congressmen.  There’s Congressman Chet Atkins.  Just if you’re born in Boston, you’re a natural, you know how to ask for it, you know, Teddy Kennedy, Billy Bulser.  In a very polite way, you just go down and figure out how to get it and bring it back.  Good fun.
	But at that point I remembered the woman who was in the gutter, picking pears, and I said to Hugh Joseph at Tufts Nutrition School, “There’s got to be a better way.  Why can’t vulnerable women and children get access to fresh fruits and vegetables?  How do we figure this out?  We have a bit of money.”
	Hugh said, “Well, there’s something called the Women, Infants, and Children’s Program.”  So we sat around Tufts drinking a few beers and put together this program called the WIC, Women, Infants, and Children’s Fruit and Vegetable Voucher Program.  And I asked Dukakis—I still have the original memo.  I sent Dukakis a memo, and he sent back notes, “If you can find ten grand from a foundation, I’ll give you seven grand from the budget,” or however that worked out.
	So I rang up one of my mother’s friends from Boston University.  Her son was a major philanthropist in Oregon.  I asked Earl Childs, “Earl, I need $10,000 for this new program.  Dukakis will put up seven, and we’ll get started in four farmers’ markets where each WIC mother and child would get $20 in a voucher to buy fruits and vegetables at a farmers’ market.”
So we started that in ’86 and it expanded in two years later to throughout the state with state money, and then in 1992, Congressman Atkins from Lowell saw the program in his town and said, “I’m going to put this in the budget,” and he put up 15 million dollars for an annual national program for the WIC Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program.
	We then added in 1989 a senior program to do the same thing for low-income seniors, and Congressman John Baldacci then put 15 million dollars in the Farm Bill, and I’ll come back to that, how that occurred.
	So the WIC Farmers’ Market expanded very rapidly throughout the country in the nineties, and then in 1990 the World Bank said I’d better come back or I’d lose my job.  Since they paid better than the Commissionership and since the Republicans elected Weld governor instead of John Silber, I left the Department of Agriculture of Massachusetts.  I went back to work on Eastern Europe agriculture.
	At that point, the [Berlin] Wall had fallen, and it was a very exciting time working in Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia on their agricultural reforms in the early nineties at that time, so I was in charge of most of many of the agricultural projects in those countries at that time, especially in Poland.  That was a terrific time because there was just a lot of energy in those countries.  Lech Walesa and Jaroslav Balzerowicz were all interested in reform.  The World Bank played a pretty major role in Poland in helping on the economic restructuring, and myself and a few others worked on a reform side.   That was a lively, lively time, really one of the most interesting times.

Q:  The agricultural side of all of that got involved in what?

Schumacher:  If you look at Poland, Poland had more farmers than America did.  People don’t realize that.  They have over 2.5 million small farmers in Poland, and the communist government in Poland was too strong politically, so unlike in Ukraine in the Stalin era in 1920s and thirties when they collectivized all those small farms in Ukraine, starved millions of Ukrainians doing that, that did not happen in Poland.
	So after the war, when the Nazis then controlled Poland and then the Communists controlled Poland, the Communists left these small farms alone and then collectivized the German farms.  The big Prussian estates became Polish state farms.  So there was a bifurcation of big state farms, which were the former Russian, former German, Prussian, nobility and some nobility in Poland that had farms with over two million small Polish farms.  So you had a very interesting big farm-small farm structure, with all of the processing done by the state.

Q:  Processing meaning?

Schumacher:  Milk processing, vegetable processing, pierogi-making.  All the great Polish foods were all processed by the state.  So in 1990 the new government then, working with the World Bank, wanted to kind of rationalize that system, privatize again the big farms and have them done carefully and sell them off, rent them and then sell them to medium-sized farmers.  You’d then good new investment in privatized processing in the distribution.
	There again, there was an explosion of the farmers’ markets when that happened, so you had all these small farmers then selling their products like we did in Massachusetts in the 1980’s and 1990’s, the explosion of farmers’ markets in Poland was fascinating, absolutely fascinating to see that change.

Q:  The first explosion that you spoke of was where?

Schumacher:  In Poland.

Q:  Then at the same time, what was happening in the United States with small farms?

Schumacher:  Again, if you come back to New York City, a gentlemen named Barry Benepe and his colleague Bob Lewis in 1976 started the Union Square and the 59th Street farmers’ markets.  Barry Benepe, city planner from MIT, Bob Lewis working in the New York Department of Agriculture, said, “Let’s try this out,” and it became very popular.  I read that famous New Yorker article that John McPhee wrote—

Q:  Why don’t you describe what that was.

Schumacher:  Again, coming back into the mid-seventies, I was still at the World Bank, I was on a plane coming back from London on some trip from Africa working on  agriculture.  I picked up a New Yorker at Heathrow Airport, and in the New Yorker this fellow John McPhee had this article where he went out and lived on a farm in the Hudson Valley, helped the farmer pick the vegetables, get on the truck at three o’clock in the morning and came into 59th Street and helped sell these vegetables from this truck with this farmer.  I think Dan Holland was his name.  Did this for a summer, and then wrote an article called “Giving Good Weight” in the New Yorker.  McPhee was a very, very fine writer.  He described growing the stuff in the Hudson Valley, picking and schlepping it down into New York and then selling it and they ran out of produce.  I mean, he was mobbed because people hadn’t seen this kind of quality that really hadn’t been in New York City since the thirties, since my great-grandfather and grandfather were selling at the Wallabout Farmers Market, at the Washington Square Market.  There were no more farmers’ markets in the 1950s and 1960s.  They were wiped out by the supermarkets, so that you couldn’t buy locally grown fresh fruits and vegetables from 1935 to 1976.

Q:  The supermarkets came in about ’35?

Schumacher:  Yes.  Bohack, A & P, First National, and Gristedes, and they basically bought from California, Florida, and Texas.  Maybe some New York apples.  Of course, there weren’t any farms left in Queens.  Levitt came in, you know, took all the potato farms in Suffolk County and put in housing.  Same thing in New Jersey.  So your urban agriculture, the same thing happened in Boston.  You could not compete with root crops and salad crops with California, Florida, Texas.  You simply couldn’t compete.  So you were getting shipped-in product from far away, and there weren’t any local fresh, healthy—well, they were healthy, but there weren’t any local seasonal vegetables.  And that’s what Bob Lewis and Barry Benepe, they introduced or reintroduced local agriculture to the city of New York, and it just exploded.  I read that article, I said, “That’s really cool.”  So I called up Barry Benepe and I introduced myself to him.  We’ve been friends ever since.
	So when I was Commissioner of Agriculture in Massachusetts, I said to Barry, “How do we do this stuff?”
	So he helped me expand Freddie Winthrop’s work, and so we really promoted fruits and vegetables in farmers’ markets and started a bunch of these markets in Massachusetts.  I think in 1985 there were probably 20, 25 farmers’ markets in Massachusetts, and now there are 202.  So one out of every two towns in Massachusetts now has a farmers’ market.  I think New York City must have 50 or 60 farmers’ markets. While these markets are not a huge part of the American food system, but they’ve become a cultural part of the American food system where local chefs locally—they go to the market more as much for the healthy, interesting foods as for community.  They bring their dog and the kids in the strollers, and it becomes a community event where people can get up on a Saturday or Sunday and go down to the local farmers’ market and buy their strawberries or the asparagus, and that becomes all year-round.  They continue to come back to that and they continue to grow.  In 1980 there might have been 800 farmers’ markets in America.  This year there will be over 5,000.

Q:  Oh, my.

Schumacher:  In 1980 there might have been 3,000 farmers selling in the farmers’ markets.  This year there will be 40,000.  So it’s become a parallel food system as people have gone back to the roots that they had in 1910 and 1920, when my great-grandfather and grandfather were selling at the Washington Square Market, the Wallabout Market, and the Harlem Market directly to consumers or to small corner stores.
So what come around goes around, and the same crops, carrots and parsnips and leeks.  Looking back on it, my father grew six crops.  My brother, direct marketing, grew forty crops, so the new system requires much more management and technical capability of farmers selling at roadside stands and at farmers’ markets than it did for those farmers just selling wholesale in 1930, 1935, 1940, 1945 from this region.  So the technical demands on farm families now are far higher than they were thirty, forty, fifty years ago.

Q:  How so?

Schumacher:  Because, an example, you would harvest lettuce once or twice.  You’d plant twenty acres, you’d harvest it all at once, you’d sell it to the First National or Bohack and hope to make some money.  Now you’re going to a farmers’ market, customers want this lettuce year-round.  So how do you sell lettuce year-round?  That’s exactly what my grandfather did in 1905.  He was growing lettuce year-round in Queens for the Wallabout Farmers Markets, using all kinds of technologies, and those technologies are now being rethought to grow lettuce year-round for the markets in Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.

Q:  Were you married during this period of time?

Schumacher:  Early on, and then I was divorced and remarried later on.

Q:  But I guess what I’m wondering is were you married when you were traveling around the world?

Schumacher:  Oh, yes.  That travel did not do great things for my marriage, but that’s another subject.

Q:  But without kids.

Schumacher:  No children, no.

Q:  So how long did that period last before your next kind of significant job?

Schumacher:  1994, I was sitting in a bar in a hotel in Prague when some person came from the bar, carrying a blackboard with bells atop, and said, “Phone at the bar.”  I was working in Prague on an agricultural project, part of this changeover from communism to other systems.  So I took the phone, it was Washington and the caller asked, “Would you like to be considered for a position in the Clinton administration?”
	I said, “Sounds good to me.”  So I said, “Sure.”  Then I called my wife and said, “I just quit the World Bank.”
	She said, “Fine.”
	So I became head of the Foreign Agricultural Service for President Clinton at USDA and focused on promoting American agriculture exports around the world.

Q:  How did they know about you?

Schumacher:  I think I had met USDA Secretary Mike Espy during the Dukakis campaign when I was working for Dukakis, and Dukakis had an agricultural briefing at his home in Brookline, and I was sitting in on the briefing.  I picked up Mike Espy at the airport and drove him over, and he knew me at that point when I was commissioner.  Then the USDA Deputy Secretary knew me, Mr.Rich Rominger, said they were looking for somebody to run the Foreign Ag Service.  They said, “Well, let’s go to see if this Gus Schumacher is interested and see if he’d quit the Bank and take a salary cut.”  So sure, why not.

Q:  Why Gus Schumacher?

Schumacher:  Well, because I was doing interesting stuff.

Q:  Like what?

Schumacher:  Well, I got in a little trouble occasionally.  When Monsanto was sticking cows with bovine growth hormone in Massachusetts, I was a bit grouchy because I regulated the milk supply.  We didn’t know whether BST was safe or not.  They didn’t tell me.

Q:  You mean bovine growth hormone?

Schumacher:  Bovine growth hormone, BST.  I got very grouchy, and some reporter asked me, “What do you think about this?”  And I said I didn’t think much of it.  “I think it’s just “crack for cows.”  We ought to have a look at it.”
	He said, “What did you say?”
	I said, “Oh, no, no.”
	He said, “I heard you say it.”  And so he put that in the headline in a story in the Boston Globe, and that did not go down very well with the governor, and Monsanto was very grouchy about that.
	Then I did ban the chemical Alachlor from being sprayed on corn near public wells in western Mass., and that, again, was not very popular with—

Q:  What was that?

Schumacher:  It was a chemical, weed-control chemical that was used on corn that unclear whether it was carcinogenic or not, but I said, “Maybe you can do it where it doesn’t affect public wells, but when you’re going to be drinking the water, I don’t want something that was untested.”  It was unclear whether it was a carcinogenic or not.  I thought we’d take a little precaution, put a thousand-foot buffer around a public well and asked them not to spray Alachlor.  The Monsanto company was very, very grouchy about that.  Actually, when this ban was announced it in the Wall Street Journal, their stock fell three points.  I didn’t realize it was 52 percent of the profits of Monsanto.

Q:  Oh, my.

Schumacher:  And they were worried that this would be the camel under the tent, and this would then create more problems for the product around the country.  So I did get a number of calls on that one as well.
	Then I was very interested in local agriculture, and I was dating at the time, so I’d ask my dates to go to restaurants, but I’d take my own tomatoes.

Q:  This was in Washington?

Schumacher:  No, when I was Commissioner.

Q:  In Massachusetts in about what period of time?

Schumacher:  Eighty-six, ’87.

Q:  Why did you take your tomatoes?

Schumacher:  Well, because the tomatoes in the restaurants—there were some very great chefs, Jasper White, Lydia Shire, Gordon Hamersley, and I wanted to eat well and didn’t have a lot of money, but I enjoyed eating out.  So I’d take my dates to these restaurants and the food was good, but it wasn’t from Massachusetts, so I’d say, “What the heck, I’m going to bring my own tomatoes and lettuce.”
So I knew I was going into Lydia Shire’s restaurant over at the Bostonian, and I had some French farm specialist with me.  So I went to my brother’s farm and we picked some tomatoes, and they were good tomatoes.  These were really tasty, vine ripe August tomatoes, just at  peak of flavor.  So I went to Lydia’s with a little brown paper bag with five pounds of six varieties, Jet Stars and Celebrities, really nice tomatoes, and asked Lydia for a serrated knife and some vinaigrette.
	“What’s that about?”
	“I’ve got my own tomatoes.”
	She was not a happy camper.  So we sliced them up, and we had some great tomatoes for lunch.
So I said, “What the heck.”  So I went over to Gordon Hamersley’s the next couple of days, and then had some left over, and I took them.  The woman I was dating, now I got married to, and it was a good test, because if she thought I was really off the wall, that would be the last date.  So I brought my tomatoes and we asked Gordon for a serrated knife, and said, “Gordon, do you mind?”
	He got interested in it, and he said, “Not a problem.”

Q:  This was the same brown paper bag approach?

Schumacher:  Well, same brown paper, sitting down by the chair, just kind of by the table, you know, slice them up and put them on the table, bring a knife and vinaigrette.  So Gordon came over and he said—he knew me

Q:  Fortunately.

Schumacher:  And he said, “This is off the wall.”  He said to my wife, my girlfriend then, “What do you think about this?”
	“Good-tasting tomatoes.”
	“Do you mind hanging out with this crazy guy, bringing his own tomatoes to a nice restaurant?”
	She said, “No, I’m interested in your reaction.”
	He said, “Well, that’s interesting.”
So then we started featuring—my staff and I started going to all the restaurants and said, “Would you buy local?”

Q:  Where did these tomatoes come from, by the way?

Schumacher:  I was actually growing them on my brother’s farm, and I had my own tomato patch, and so varieties of tomatoes.  It was kind of fun.
	So we got all the restaurants to start featuring local fruits and vegetables and local product, and Julia Child was very interested, because she would go out to Wilson’s farm and do the same thing.  She and Paul Child would go to Wilson’s, who I worked with, and they would buy their vegetables out there and then bring them back and she would feature them on National Public Television.

Q:  What was Wilson’s full name?

Schumacher:  Alan Wilson.  Wilson’s farm in Lexington, near our farm in Lexington.
	So Julia and I would kind of go to these different places and feature local stuff.  I’d do it in restaurants and she’d do it on television.  It was fun.
Eventually, the Boston Globe started picking it up and wrote some stories featuring fresh local fruits and vegetables, fresh and grown, not just at farmers’ markets but also at local restaurants.  So we really promoted that pretty hard to get chefs to learn about the pairing and buying seasonally in Massachusetts, and that was easy to do because you had some of these farmers’ markets coming in.  They’d go to a farmers’ market like in Copley Square or in Harvard Square or in City Hall, and they could buy the stuff right there.  They didn’t have to schlep out to the local farms.
	But then the chefs got interested in it, and they got more prosperous.  They moved their families to the suburbs.  On the way in to their restaurants, they would buy from local farms.  Gordon Hamersley then would stop every morning at Verrill’s Farm in Concord or Wilson’s farm in Lexington and fill up his trunk with local stuff and bring in it.  Then farmers started delivering to local restaurants, and that was kind of an interesting time to see how that local food movement—and the same thing started happening in New York because Danny Meyer located his restaurant down on Union Square, which was a drug haven in the seventies, but the Union Square farmers’ market helped turn it around.  He put his restaurant—I think it was called Green.  What was Danny Meyer’s restaurant called in Union Square?  Union Square Café.

Q:  Yes.

Schumacher:  And he would buy at the Union Square farmers’ market.  Then other farmers started coming into the farmers’ market in Union Square, and I have pictures of carts of stuff going out of Union Square where farmers started selling at those local markets.
	Then you had new young chefs coming in.  You had Danny Barber at Blue Hill, you had Michel Nischan at Heartbeat, and they started reaching out not only to local farmers’ markets, they started reaching out to new farmers, refugee farmers, Hispanic farmers, new varieties to bring into their restaurants.  So it’s kind of an interesting development of how the local food movement back in the seventies that Barry Benepe started with John McPhee evolved to households and consumers, but mostly middle class, and then evolved to higher-end restaurants and now has evolved to places like Whole Foods and others.  It’s kind of interesting to see that movement that really Barry Benepe and Bob Lewis started with McPhee’s great article in the New Yorker, which he later developed into a book called Giving Good Weight.

Q:  Let’s go back a little bit.  In that Julia Child period, you were living up there?

Schumacher:  When I was commissioner, yes, I lived in Boston.  I lived with my father for a while and then in an apartment, and then when he passed away, moved back to the farm.

Q:  Then at what point did you go to Washington?

Schumacher:  In 1990, moved back to Washington.  When Bill Weld took over and Dukakis—when the Democrats lost the governorship, I moved back to Washington and rejoined the World Bank.

Q:  I’d like to actually talk about the press a little bit later, but I know one of the things that has helped you, I don’t know, be so influential is that you maintain your friendships with people from all these different aspects of your life and help them meet each other, whether it’s farmers or politicians or whatever, that you’ve been a bridge builder.  How do you react to that?

Schumacher:  Well, one of the things that we tried to do with Dukakis, he was very good because he would go into the countryside in the summertime and meet people around there, and we would get chefs and farmers to put the lunches on.  So every time we’d have a big sort of a meeting, whether it was New Bedford or Hadley or Berkshires or the North Shore or the South Shore, I’d ask him if we could put the lunch on.  So I’d ask the local chefs to work with the local farmers to have a Mass. grown and fresh luncheon, and it was fun.  So we had this great food.  Then we’d ask the press to come.

Q:  Did you know these local chefs and local farmers?

Schumacher:  No, I knew the farmers, but I didn’t know the chefs.  But Janet Christensen, who is my communications director, really enjoyed good food, and she knew the food editors.  So she’d call up the food editors and say, “Do you know Terry Maloney or Tim Morse out there in Hadley?  He’s got a good farm.  Could he—?”
And then we’d call him up.  I’d call him up and I’d say, “Can you bring your ciders to the event?  Could you bring these special cheeses from these different new cheese makers?”  That was very embryonic, these new varieties of cheeses back in the eighties.  People weren’t making these unique artisan cheeses then.  Specialty ciders.  Specialty cider pairings.  All these new products that people didn’t know about.  We’d invite them to come to these lunches, have the chefs prepare them, and then have the food editors come and they would write about them.  The Governor liked it a lot, because it was good food, and he liked good food.  He and Kitty liked eating well.
	I remember one day, got a little carried away, and I said, “Let’s have an all cider nine course elegant meal.”

Q:  Who did you say that to?  [laughs]

Schumacher:  To a great chef in Cambridge.  I forgot his name.  I called up the cider makers.  There were eight of them who were making great ciders, and I said, “I want to challenge the chef to have a nine-course meal, and each course be made with either hard or soft cider.”  There would be a cider sorbet or a cider vinaigrette, cider vinegar, a cider pork chop.  So we had a great evening.  The chef rose to the challenge.  We brought in ten cider makers, we brought in fifteen food editors, and we had a ball.  Of course, it was kind of crazy, but the writers wrote it up.
Then I made a little mistake.  I love tomatoes.  So I started the Annual Massachusetts Tomato Tasting Contest back in 1986.

Q:  Strictly Massachusetts tomatoes?

Schumacher:  Strictly Massachusetts.  So you basically have all the tomato farmers coming together, and then you’d have the food editors come and judge, and the chefs.  So a woman in Washington named Phyllis Richman heard about this, and she said, “Can I come up to this contest?”  So she flew up to become a judge at the first Annual Massachusetts Tomato Tasting.  We had like thirty different varieties of tomatoes, and, of course, all these farmers were standing around.  This is in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in some park.  So we had the food editors and we had chefs and politicians judging these, and it was fun, and Phyllis got interested in it.  She went back to Washington.  I was in Massachusetts.  She wrote it up in the food page of the Washington Post, kind of this, again, crazy commissioner running tomato tasting.  So the next year I did it at City Hall.

Q:  In Boston.

Schumacher:  In Boston.  Neil Pierce, who was a Washington Post columnist, said, “Gus, I want in.  I’ve heard about this tomato contest.  You can’t just let food writers.  I’m a political writer.  I want in on this thing.”

Q:  In the days when we had budgets for traveling around.

Schumacher:  So he came up and he wrote a funny article, because I invited a California tomato grower, an old friend of mine, and he brought his tomatoes in a shoebox, picked them beautifully out of the field, flew in, and he got beaten by an eleven-year-old girl out of New Bedford for the top prize.

Q:  That’s interesting, because you certainly wouldn’t think of Massachusetts as the natural home for good tomatoes.

Schumacher:  But everybody grows good tomatoes.  People have to find out who they are.  So that contest, you know, we’re coming up to its twenty-fifth anniversary.  We started in ’86.  This year will be the twenty-third, and it’s a big deal.  You have about forty or fifty tomato growers vying for different categories.  Everybody wants to be a judge.  So you kind of have to sign up.  As Neil Peirce said, you’ve really got to know the politicians to get an invitation to the Boston Tomato Contest!

Q:  I see.  [laughs]

Schumacher:  He said, “You’ve got to really know.  I really worked this hard, and I got myself an invitation to be one of the senior judges at the Massachusetts Second Annual Tomato Tasting Contest,” and he put this out in the Washington Post.  Of course, he was syndicated and this went everywhere.  So I got a lot of grief for that.  Kind of fun.

Q:  Where is it held now?

Schumacher:  Same place.  That’s how I met John Ogonowski.

Q:  And he was?

Schumacher:  John Ogonowski was a pilot for American Airlines, and I have the original pictures in 1986 when he came to the tomato contest.  He flew for American Airlines during the day, and weekends he’d farm in Dracut, Mass.  He brought his tomatoes to the City Hall farmers’ market and won a prize.  His daughters are all eight, nine, ten years old.  Later, in the 1990s when I was undersecretary, I remembered John.  He lives in Dracutt, Mass  and I called him up.  I said, “John, we’ve got all these new refugees from Cambodia.  You’ve got a big farm.  Would you lease them a couple acres so they could grow some stuff?”  Because they were all coming in from Vietnam and Laos.

Q:  Actually, let’s explain what that was.  Could you tell me who these refugees were and how they got here?

Schumacher:  I wasn’t a veteran, but many of my friends were in Vietnam in the war in the sixties, including my college roommate.  In the Vietnam War, the CIA recruited hill tribesmen called Hmong and Lao to fight, who didn’t like the communists.  The communists were basically flatlanders.  They were rice growers.  And these were Hmong, basically tribesmen in the mountains, and they were anti-communists, and so the CIA recruited them to fight the communists in the sixties and early seventies.

Q:  Recruited them, meaning they would be paid or given—

Schumacher:  Weapons.  They would rescue our pilots who were shot down.  They would do ambushes.  It was spooky, spooky stuff, but they were very effective against the communists and created a lot of havoc for the communists along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.  When the war was then terminated, they decided they’d better get out, because they were then shot by the communists.

Q:  About how many people are we talking about?

Schumacher:  A million, maybe two million, a lot.

Q:  Significant.

Schumacher:  A lot.  A lot.  And many of them escaped to Thailand, to camps, and because they had fought for the Americans, they became refugees and were allowed to come to America back in the mid-seventies and eighties from these camps.  So hundreds of thousands came.

Q:  But this was sort of gradual, wasn’t it?

Schumacher:  Gradual.  Not all at once.

Q:  And we brought them here?

Schumacher:  We brought them.  The State Department flew them in to settle all over America, including Lowell.  Many states, in the Central Valley of California.

Q:  Under what aegis were they—

Schumacher:  State Department, official refugees.  We bring in 80,000 refugees a year from around the world.  They were brought in in a special refugee category.  They liked to farm, and they started farming.  I did not know this.  I did not know these people existed until I met one of the accidentally at a meeting and said, “Oh, let me come out and visit with them.”

Q:  You were at that point?

Schumacher:  Undersecretary of Agriculture in 1998, ’97.  I remember the guy’s name was Charlie Chang, and he said, “Well, come on out.”
	I said, “I’ll be out in Fresno in a couple weeks.  I’ll maybe get a few people together and have breakfast.”
	He said to me, “You know, Mr. Undersecretary, we don’t actually do eggs and bacon at seven o’clock in the morning.  We normally have more of a family meal in the fields with basically rice and veggies and a little bit of meat.”
	“Okay, fine.  I’ll be there.”  So we found out where they were, and I got a pickup and went out to the field and had a wonderful meal at ten o’clock in the morning, sort of a Asian vegetable rice meal with a bit of pork or chicken, with you fingers.

Q:  This was where?

Schumacher:  In Fresno, California.  I discovered there were two thousand of these Hmong farmers farming on a few rented acres all over the Central Valley of California.  I said, “Whoa, that’s interesting,” and I started getting interested.  There were these farms all over America, but no one knew about them.  They were on one or two acres, three acres, six acres.  Did not have access to any federal programs because they couldn’t speak the language, and they sold wherever they could sell, whether the flea markets or the little roadside stand or whatever.

Q:  So just to be clear, we brought them in.  That is to say, the United States brought them in, but then did not give them any financial support afterwards?

Schumacher:  Maybe six months.  Refugees are still coming in, but they get six months of food stamps and welfare payments.  Then they’re on their own.  Give them a rental stipend and give then citizenship or access to citizenship, but they’re legal refugee immigrants, and they’re coming in from Russia, from Bosnia, from Vietnam.

Q:  You mean now?

Schumacher:  Now.  Somalia, Kenya, anywhere there’s a big conflict and they were on the wrong side.  We’re very generous in having them come in.  They’re all over America.  Somalian, Liberian, you name it, they’re everywhere and they’re farming.  So I felt that we need to at least give them equal access to federal programs, for credit marketing, technical assistance, so they get the same access as any other Midwestern Iowa corn grower would have.

Q:  How did you do that?

Schumacher:  By basically hiring some of their sons and daughters who spoke English to go into those offices and help them fill out loan applications.

Q:  Loan applications at what offices?

Schumacher:  At the county USDA office.  Every county in America, in rural America, has an office, USDA, where they provide services, whether it’s credit, marketing, world development, conservation.  I said those thousands of farmers should have the same access to those offices as your traditional corn grower in Indiana has.

Q:  Even though they’re not citizens, or were they?

Schumacher:  They were citizens.

Q:  They were instantly made citizens?

Schumacher:  Well, they had the legal right to the way to become citizenship, to access all federal programs.  So I said, “Let’s hustle and get them access,” and so we hired their sons and daughters who spoke English and trained them up to be loan officers.  So when they came to the counter to fill out an application, someone spoke their language, someone understood where they’re coming from, could understand their financial system and help them get a loan.

Q:  You could do this all on your own?  Did you have to get permission from—

Schumacher:  No.  No, I was undersecretary.

Q:  I understand, but did you need Secretary clearance, no?

Schumacher:  No, just go out and do it.  Just tell my staff to do it.

Q:  And you had enough of a budget with flexibility so that—

Schumacher:  Yes, oh, sure.  If you’re undersecretary and you don’t do things, then you shouldn’t be doing it.  So I just instructed the staff, “This is what I want to do,” and we went and did it.  No big deal.

Q:  How quickly was that?

Schumacher:  Took six months.  When you’re confirmed—people don’t quite understand.  When you’re confirmed by the Senate to be undersecretary, all these confirmations, that’s a big deal, because the Senate basically says, “We approve that you are qualified to do your job,” have gone through all the bits and pieces, and you have authorities.  Like I had authority over the Commodity Credit Corporation, which was 30 billion dollars, to carry out certain policies to basically promote and benefit American agriculture, which is written in the 1935 law by Roosevelt in the New Deal.  It was that authority that I could tap to provide 15 million dollars to create a senior farmers’ market nutrition program for one million low-income elders.  You just look at the fine print and say there’s nothing that says you can’t do it.  So we just told the staff to go do it, and informed Congress about it, and Congress seemed to like it and put it in legislation.

Q:  Why don’t we take up from there—
